three game-changing tips for keto success first one ease into keto don't take the plunge when people come to my clinic they go directly from normal diet to keto diet sandwiches to keto and a snap hold on abruptly slashing carbs can chock your system instead I advise slowly transitioning by tapering down your carb intake and then increase the fat number two hydration is a keto Lifesaver now most people when they do the keto they dehydrate carbs store water 1 G of glycogen stores three molecules of water so as the carbs vanish so does your water balance avoid dehydration with large glass of water in the morning and sip it throughout the day I would suggest 40 ml per kg of body weight is the standard calculation tip three diversify your fats go omega-3 it's not all bacon and cheese the bad fats Embrace good fats like omega-3 found in Salmon sardines mackerel avocado olive oil chia seeds flax seeds also make a great choice do not follow keto rules blindly
