[0.08 - 4.04] diabetes sugar you may have heard about
[2.28 - 6.92] it well me and my dad were having a
[4.04 - 9.00] conversation recently he's 77 and he's
[6.92 - 10.72] like you know what my diabetes is under
[9.00 - 12.88] control I'm like Dad your diabetes is
[10.72 - 14.64] not under control you're taking 14 or 15
[12.88 - 16.84] tablets and you're not walking and not
[14.64 - 19.84] looking at your diet India is the
[16.84 - 23.40] diabetic capital of the world 77 million
[19.84 - 27.04] in 2019 we slated to go up to 134
[23.40 - 31.92] Million by 20145 as per data in the
[27.04 - 34.60] internet now what shocked me was was 57%
[31.92 - 37.44] of these individuals remain undiagnosed
[34.60 - 39.04] which means diabetics is a silent killer
[37.44 - 41.08] now I want you to understand that when
[39.04 - 43.56] my father made this statement my
[41.08 - 45.28] diabetes is under control he is using
[43.56 - 47.40] medication to control his diabetes his
[45.28 - 49.68] diabetes is not under control medicine
[47.40 - 52.68] is trying to control it but what if I
[49.68 - 55.08] could tell you that there is a way for
[52.68 - 57.52] diabetes to be effectively managed in
[55.08 - 60.28] fact for you to not get diabetes you
[57.52 - 62.84] have to learn to effectively manage your
[60.28 - 65.52] energy levels which comes from your
[62.84 - 68.60] input which is diet and your output
[65.52 - 71.88] which is your exercise both of which we
[68.60 - 74.76] are culprits in this country of not
[71.88 - 77.40] doing it correctly like our grandparents
[74.76 - 79.56] did they ate correctly they walked and
[77.40 - 82.92] exercised correctly something that you
[79.56 - 85.16] and I are not being exposed to so here's
[82.92 - 88.48] my video on diabeties and how we can
[85.16 - 91.44] effectively get us to understand what
[88.48 - 93.92] could I do to pre prevent diabetes or if
[91.44 - 96.40] I do have diabetes what are the small
[93.92 - 98.60] things that I can do to arrest the
[96.40 - 100.28] progression of this disease so yesterday
[98.60 - 104.00] in my counseling room I was explaining
[100.28 - 105.84] to a 30-year-old kid how diabetes forms
[104.00 - 108.12] in the human body now you first need to
[105.84 - 110.64] understand sugar and its management you
[108.12 - 112.04] see when you eat food the food is broken
[110.64 - 114.44] down now this food contains
[112.04 - 117.12] carbohydrates which is the sugar this
[114.44 - 120.52] sugar breaks down and this sugar breaks
[117.12 - 122.36] down into fructose or glucose now this
[120.52 - 123.96] goes into the bloodstream and now when
[122.36 - 125.96] it goes into the bloodstream the
[123.96 - 127.56] bloodstream says oh wow Salam sa all
[125.96 - 128.76] sugars come you have to go into all the
[127.56 - 130.68] cells you have to go to the brain you
[128.76 - 132.76] have to give energy and everything but
[130.68 - 134.48] you cannot have a high sugar level so
[132.76 - 136.48] there is a police cop for this high
[134.48 - 139.00] sugar level now who's this police cop
[136.48 - 140.80] this police cop is a guy called insulin
[139.00 - 142.40] insulin is a hormone it's like you know
[140.80 - 144.32] if there's too much crowd on the roads
[142.40 - 146.48] outside your house then you call up the
[144.32 - 148.76] police station pancreas hello Mr
[146.48 - 150.44] pancreas can you send one hoala vehicle
[148.76 - 152.16] one police vehicle the police vehicle
[150.44 - 154.00] will come with cops the insulin guy
[152.16 - 155.76] comes out and tells all the sugar Mo
[154.00 - 157.88] molecules don't party in the street what
[155.76 - 160.52] is partying in the street high blood
[157.88 - 163.88] sugar level so by doing ly insulin
[160.52 - 166.24] pushes all the sugar into the cell now
[163.88 - 168.72] over years of having lot of parties in
[166.24 - 170.20] the streets high blood sugar level
[168.72 - 172.68] insulin gets a call at the police
[170.20 - 174.68] station hello outside Mr Ryan Fernando's
[172.68 - 176.60] house there's a party happening are are
[174.68 - 178.44] every day and every year high sugar
[176.60 - 180.04] level high parties happening yeah we are
[178.44 - 182.52] going to send eight police police
[180.04 - 184.88] vehicles we send eight police vehicles
[182.52 - 186.96] AR by the sugar party doesn't disappear
[184.88 - 190.12] then next month we sell 10 police
[186.96 - 192.80] vehicles this is the concept of type 2
[190.12 - 197.08] diabetes where over a period of time
[192.80 - 199.72] your police insulin Guy cannot respond
[197.08 - 201.20] well or its insulin resistance has
[199.72 - 203.88] increased now you have another type of
[201.20 - 206.92] Diabetes which is type 1 diabetes which
[203.88 - 209.80] is more on an autoimmune side where your
[206.92 - 211.40] police station gets affected when your
[209.80 - 214.56] police station gets affected that's the
[211.40 - 217.08] pancreas the production of insulin is
[214.56 - 220.88] lowered or lesser and therefore you have
[217.08 - 223.64] to recruit a private security Force the
[220.88 - 225.48] private security force is injections of
[223.64 - 228.36] insulin so now you've understood you
[225.48 - 230.16] take carbohydrate that forms into sugar
[228.36 - 231.76] and then you need police to control it
[230.16 - 233.32] now every day if you're having a party
[231.76 - 235.32] in your bloodstream by eating the wrong
[233.32 - 237.40] foods every day you have to send boat
[235.32 - 239.28] loads or truck loads of police to
[237.40 - 241.72] control that after sometime police will
[239.28 - 241.72] be say
[242.28 - 247.16] contr
[243.80 - 249.64] sug so this is diabetes for you and it
[247.16 - 251.56] starts with your inactivity because when
[249.64 - 253.08] you do a lot of activity you pull out
[251.56 - 254.84] all the party makers in your blood you
[253.08 - 257.08] lower your blood sugar level by walking
[254.84 - 259.32] after every meal and you also lower your
[257.08 - 261.44] blood sugar level by eating the right
[259.32 - 264.40] Foods when you construct your protein
[261.44 - 267.48] carbs and fats in a right quantity at
[264.40 - 269.32] the right time of the right quality so
[267.48 - 271.12] let me explain further to you and then
[269.32 - 272.96] there is another form of diabetes which
[271.12 - 275.20] happens mostly to mothers it's called
[272.96 - 278.20] gestational diabetes Now this diabetes
[275.20 - 280.44] develops during pregnancy when the body
[278.20 - 282.16] cannot produce enough of the insulin to
[280.44 - 284.20] meet the increased needs of both the
[282.16 - 286.60] mother and the growing baby this
[284.20 - 289.32] condition normally happens in the second
[286.60 - 292.44] or the third trimester and generally
[289.32 - 294.72] solves itself after child birth however
[292.44 - 296.88] you need to know this mothers
[294.72 - 299.68] gestational diabetes can significantly
[296.88 - 302.28] increase the risk of Mother's later de
[299.68 - 304.72] veloping type 2 diabetes later on in her
[302.28 - 307.08] life and it does pose a health risk to
[304.72 - 310.56] both the baby and the mother and there's
[307.08 - 312.84] a likelihood of more obesity and type 2
[310.56 - 315.16] diabetes both in the mother and child
[312.84 - 317.56] gestational diabetes affects pregnant
[315.16 - 319.80] women who have a higher risk factor such
[317.56 - 321.60] as being overweight there's already a
[319.80 - 324.04] family history of diabetes or they
[321.60 - 326.52] belong to certain ethnic groups so
[324.04 - 329.72] managing gestational diabetes involves
[326.52 - 332.00] again making dietary adjustments to
[329.72 - 334.36] control the blood sugar level such as
[332.00 - 336.48] eating balanced meals most mothers are
[334.36 - 338.64] told eat double the quantity that's not
[336.48 - 340.72] true you just need a carefully
[338.64 - 343.24] controlled diet with the medical
[340.72 - 346.08] nutritionist so monitoring carbohydrate
[343.24 - 348.16] would be important in pregnancy and kind
[346.08 - 350.12] of making the food consumption spread
[348.16 - 352.72] out throughout the day to avoid High
[350.12 - 354.96] spikes and blood glucose levels in some
[352.72 - 357.16] cases the mothers may need insulin
[354.96 - 360.80] therapy to maintain optimal blood sugar
[357.16 - 363.20] levels now my solution is regular
[360.80 - 366.08] physical activity and monitoring of the
[363.20 - 367.92] blood glucose levels which will help
[366.08 - 370.20] better manage or prevent gestational
[367.92 - 371.80] diabetes I would recommend a close
[370.20 - 374.44] collaboration with healthc care
[371.80 - 376.04] providers including
[374.44 - 378.36] dietitians
[376.04 - 380.80] endocrinologists that ensure both the
[378.36 - 384.04] mother and the baby remain healthy so
[380.80 - 385.72] you know what I always tell people is I
[384.04 - 387.48] asked them a list of questions to
[385.72 - 389.56] diagnose diabetes with just verbal
[387.48 - 391.32] questions and those questions are in
[389.56 - 393.44] including do you have frequency of
[391.32 - 395.44] urination do you have excessive thirst
[393.44 - 397.24] do you feel extremely hungry suddenly
[395.44 - 400.40] you have gained weight or suddenly youve
[397.24 - 401.76] lost weight lots of fatigue irritability
[400.40 - 405.16] I've seen people who get irritated very
[401.76 - 406.96] easily can have uh diabetes blood Vision
[405.16 - 409.24] uh you get cuts and sores in the older
[406.96 - 411.56] age and they don't heal lots of frequent
[409.24 - 413.76] cough colds infections this could be
[411.56 - 415.52] because of a higher sugar another one
[413.76 - 418.16] which is not mentioned I would like to
[415.52 - 420.48] say that when you pee in a toilet and
[418.16 - 422.88] you find Ants the next day in around
[420.48 - 424.36] that bowl then you have sugar in your
[422.88 - 426.08] urine that's another way to check
[424.36 - 427.76] whether you got diabetes and so now that
[426.08 - 429.88] you got these questions ask yourself
[427.76 - 432.52] these questions let's talk about what
[429.88 - 434.28] could be the causes the causes could be
[432.52 - 436.24] definitely weight I look at fat people
[434.28 - 437.84] and I'm like dude you're a walking
[436.24 - 439.64] ticking Time Bomb for diabetes
[437.84 - 442.12] overweight and obesity number one
[439.64 - 444.56] physical inactivity insulin resistance
[442.12 - 446.72] genetic predecision Mommy Daddy had it
[444.56 - 448.80] poor diet is like everybody right now in
[446.72 - 451.08] the corporate world with high processed
[448.80 - 452.64] sugars and un healthy fats eating out if
[451.08 - 454.52] I look at your e-commerce apps for
[452.64 - 456.12] ordering food I can tell you with the
[454.52 - 458.40] risk element how quickly you're going to
[456.12 - 460.24] get diabetic so do you think you have
[458.40 - 461.76] diabetes do you think you're a candidate
[460.24 - 464.20] that you could become diabetic because
[461.76 - 466.36] of the way you eat so now I have a
[464.20 - 469.72] solution and that's called Nutrition
[466.36 - 473.12] Therapy Nutrition Therapy is a crucial
[469.72 - 474.56] component of diabetic management now
[473.12 - 476.76] like my dad said you know my diabetes
[474.56 - 479.68] under control he has no Nutrition
[476.76 - 481.72] Therapy now what I want to do is I need
[479.68 - 484.44] you to understand it involves a
[481.72 - 486.68] personalized diet plan designed not only
[484.44 - 489.16] to manage your glucose levels but also
[486.68 - 491.72] your body weight and balance if you have
[489.16 - 493.56] high cholesterol and BP and other issues
[491.72 - 496.76] reduce those risk factors using your
[493.56 - 498.68] diet thus you eliminate any issues that
[496.76 - 500.64] are coming from the cardiovascular point
[498.68 - 502.92] of view also so some of the key
[500.64 - 504.48] strategies that I use with my clients
[502.92 - 506.96] which have not been successful with my
[504.48 - 508.92] dad's carbohydrate management dad eat
[506.96 - 510.68] less bread I want him to monitor his
[508.92 - 513.24] carbohydrate intake I want him to choose
[510.68 - 516.04] high fiber low glycemic index foods
[513.24 - 518.76] which include whole rins legumes dlls
[516.04 - 520.80] non-starchy vegetables and fruits Yes
[518.76 - 522.36] you heard me correctly diabetics can eat
[520.80 - 524.44] fruits but you know to you need to know
[522.36 - 526.68] which fruit is allowed for a diabetic
[524.44 - 528.68] based on its glycemic index another
[526.68 - 531.48] strategy is to include proper balanced
[528.68 - 533.56] meals I believe the human race does not
[531.48 - 535.36] understand the concept of balanced meals
[533.56 - 537.56] it involves incorporating a variety of
[535.36 - 539.68] foods in balanced proportions to manage
[537.56 - 541.76] blood sugar levels and this includes
[539.68 - 544.36] lean protein healthy fats high fiber
[541.76 - 548.00] carbohydrates in actual ratio of 5 is to
[544.36 - 550.84] 3 is to2 that's 50% carbohydrates 30%
[548.00 - 553.52] protein and 20% fat now the problem over
[550.84 - 557.32] here is very few people understand diet
[553.52 - 559.56] planning and I have been able to get
[557.32 - 561.28] phenomenal results with A continuous
[559.56 - 562.96] glucose monitoring device because you
[561.28 - 564.76] make an error and you can see a sugar
[562.96 - 567.40] Spike so eat the wrong food you see a
[564.76 - 569.16] sugar Spike so I think balanced diet
[567.40 - 570.68] when I verbally tell it to people hey
[569.16 - 572.20] you need to follow balance diet people
[570.68 - 574.00] nod their head and say yes yes we know
[572.20 - 576.68] what is balanced diet they know what is
[574.00 - 578.84] balanced diet but they don't know how to
[576.68 - 581.60] serve them cells a balanced diet and by
[578.84 - 584.12] putting a CGM device on you begin to
[581.60 - 585.92] correct a person saying that dude look
[584.12 - 587.24] at this you got a sugar Spike so then
[585.92 - 590.04] you're like oh what did I eat half an
[587.24 - 592.12] hour earlier oh I ate this much amount
[590.04 - 595.08] of rice maybe tomorrow I'll eat a little
[592.12 - 598.92] bit lesser rice so that comes to my next
[595.08 - 601.24] Point eating lesser portion control in
[598.92 - 604.12] diabetic management we need to be
[601.24 - 606.28] mindful of por sizes to avoid overeating
[604.12 - 607.84] and weight gain I just had a sports
[606.28 - 611.00] athlete in my clinic and her fat
[607.84 - 613.20] percentage has gone up by about 900 G
[611.00 - 615.28] she said but I ate so disciplined and I
[613.20 - 618.76] said you know what this was the season
[615.28 - 622.40] of mango and she went oh yeah I really
[618.76 - 625.88] ate a lot of mangoes look potion control
[622.40 - 628.68] is one part the other part is we forget
[625.88 - 631.16] what we ate yesterday I can't remember
[628.68 - 634.40] what I ate for breakfast yesterday do
[631.16 - 636.44] you so when we don't remember our meals
[634.40 - 639.84] when we don't have a food diary when we
[636.44 - 643.16] don't have a CGM we are eating to
[639.84 - 646.88] fulfill our belly needs not our
[643.16 - 649.12] biochemistry requirement so if you were
[646.88 - 651.96] a finely tuned vehicle and you had to
[649.12 - 654.24] put fuel into your body I would say the
[651.96 - 656.84] amount of carbohydrate you put into your
[654.24 - 659.40] body is such that you never run out of
[656.84 - 661.72] fuel but you never put so much of fuel
[659.40 - 664.36] into you that your petrol tanks which is
[661.72 - 666.84] your fat Mass keeps increasing now how
[664.36 - 669.24] can we do this I have a solution one is
[666.84 - 671.36] the CGM but the other is regular meals
[669.24 - 673.52] and snacks we do something known as the
[671.36 - 675.60] isocaloric approach where we eat at
[673.52 - 677.60] regular intervals to maintain consistent
[675.60 - 679.80] blood sugar levels so that's one
[677.60 - 682.44] strategy I have another strategy called
[679.80 - 684.92] the omad one meal a day now this can
[682.44 - 687.00] only be done with Medical Nutrition
[684.92 - 690.60] Therapy that is you go to a medical
[687.00 - 693.32] dietician and she monitors your CGM as
[690.60 - 696.20] well as what she would be doing is
[693.32 - 697.72] testing out your heart levels as well as
[696.20 - 700.60] checking your weight and body fat
[697.72 - 704.28] percentage 3 to 6 month period to see if
[700.60 - 706.08] either many meals or one meal a day is
[704.28 - 708.28] what's going to work for you and in that
[706.08 - 711.48] Constructor meal the protein carve fat
[708.28 - 713.84] ratio also is carefully monitored and in
[711.48 - 716.96] that the timing of nutrition is also
[713.84 - 719.24] monitored and in that the sequence by
[716.96 - 722.80] which you eat in a meal that is first
[719.24 - 725.76] first I eat my salad then I have my soup
[722.80 - 727.68] and then I have my protein and then last
[725.76 - 730.68] I have my carbohydrate and this leads to
[727.68 - 733.60] the lowest possible sugar spike in your
[730.68 - 737.24] blood levels so here are some quick tips
[733.60 - 737.24] to help you manage your diabetes
