Transcript: hey India are you ordering at your office the food from outside well today's video is all about how you can order healthier if you can't carry a tiffen box to work so you see today I've ordered from a healthy restaurant my first tip to you when you order find out the best restaurants around you that will serve you healthy low oil potion control and probably more vegetable and more protein so I'm going to create a list of restaurants around your office space from you can order healthier meals now check out my meal today I've ordered a brilliant Meal which has got my protein in it it's got my salad in it some zucchini which is going to give me a lot of fiber and they've got beetroot beetroot is one of my favorites because it reduces blood pressure and calms you during work now the biggest issue I have with this healthy meal that I've ordered is the amount of rice or Roy that they will send you and I are not laborers we are desk chalkies we use our brain we don't do much of physical movement so so much of rice is not required so I tell every person going to work you need to carry two of this in your laptop bag or your napsack one is a fruit peeler one is a bowl the bowl should be designed for your carbohydrate content your oats intake your cfake content keep this as your portion measure and carry it to work this is my bowl of rice I put about 6 tablespoons of rice in this and the rest of the the rice I've got a secret I share my ordered meal with my colleague so India half your portion meal by sharing it with your colleague so these are the some of the quick tips that you could do do not drink water before your meal in copious quantities take a small sip of 50 ml during your meal try to reduce the amount of water taken so the acid in your stomach can help break down the food and digest it my quick tip to India eat early lunch finish it off in 10 to 15 minutes and then take a break of half an hour relaxing normally watch some videos my podcast or I read the newspaper you need time to let that food digest also please don't eat standing up please sit down and if you can sit in a corner cross-legged in the ancient Tradition Way that's even better where you have to bend over to eat your food which helps in allowing you not to eat too much if you have more ideas on how you can make your recipes healthier share them with me or comment below what are the healthier recipes that you take to work and I on my hand will send you a few healthy lunch recipe options that you can pack from home so today let's Deep dive into my healthy lunch ordered from out now first things first this is a lot of rice so I'm going to do a portion control by taking out only what I want to eat which is about 6 to 8 tablespoons of rice for my height and weight now if you do not know your body fat percentage and your weight come to us at the quad clinics and I'll arrange for you to get your body assessment done now I know that my visceral fat is at 4 and if I eat all of this rice for one year my visceral fat is going to go up by three points my body age is going to go up by 5 years so portion control with a bowl is very important so that's the amount of rice that I'm actually going to eat but more importantly my mouth actually watering right now is I'm looking forward to having the chicken breast that's my protein that's ideal on a fat loss program I would do only the chicken breast no carbohydrates and I would do my salad with tomatoes cucumber and zucchini and the beetroot now cures normally give you a little bit of mouth flavor because when you eat rice you need a curry along with it but both the carbohydrates and the curry will be a weight gain program for you so if you can avoid that at the lunch time what I would do is I would do a three tablespoon drizzle for the amount of rice that I eat for my body weight so if you're a 100 kg guy well you would do half of this if you had to lose weight but if you're a 50 kg woman you would do 4 tablespoons of rice and 2 tbspoon of Curry now you get it what's happening over here is when the restaurants send food to you they have a standardized portion and that's why you're putting on weight at work because you're eating food from outside maybe not a healthy restaurant maybe a healthy restaurant and even this from a healthy restaurant this is equivalent for a 90 kg man and I am only 70 kgs so that 20 kgs the food that is coming to feed that extra person is causing me to gain weight so potion control I also want to talk to you about why I carry a fruit peeler you see I feel hungry at 11:00 and 5:00 in the evening and that's when you can order Samosa bada kachori chai biscuits instead carry an apple with you take a fruit peeler peel the skin because when you peel the skin it's got a wax coating the apple is going to fill you it's low calorie low glycemic index a great way to keep your brain getting a little bit of fruit sugars to function very well in the office but not have weight gain a lot of you are doing two cups of tea three cups of coffee a day with milk and sugar that's 5 kg weight gain reduce that to black tea or black coffee without sugar and better still if you don't want any of these just have sparkling water or soda water and I've always seen that when I feel a little sluggish having a little cold water wakes me up these are few of my tips and this is what I would recommend for India to do when you're ordering outside hey and if you like this video please subscribe like share this video with your loved ones and if you want a
