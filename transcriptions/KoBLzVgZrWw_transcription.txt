Transcript: every day I get up with a single-minded focus on how I can change the way the world eats and most specifically my wife troubles me every morning what should I eat today what should I do today how can we get this better for our family ladies for your health it's the most important thing because you take care of the family I've worked with Anushka Sharma py synu Sonia Nal and a host of film stars and athletes who are all women and the number one advice that I give to all women is that your body is actually your most expensive real estate that you will ever own so throw out the Gucci bag throw out the coach bag I know you want to get that bag and even if you do have one your human body your human valuable body is more expensive than anything else you'll ever own so I've put together 10 points that I believe every woman should follow as a mantra here are my 10 points and please note them down because these could change your health for the better number one let's go with a blood test every woman I meet in my counseling room I ask her to get a blood test done a standard blood test is beneficial which will have your vitamin B12 and vitamin D levels however if you want to up the game go for a complete vitamin and mineral profiling if you plan to do a hormonal Test please do it exactly 7 days after the first day of your menstration cycle this in my opinion will be done every year and you can compare your estrogen your progesterone your testosterone and your estradi levels along with the DHEA levels these are Advanced blood tests for women who want to keep their menstrual Health in check and know you don't need to do these blood tests when you're 40 years of age you can do them even when you're 18 years of age important make sure that your minerals specifically calcium and magnesium are not low so do this blood test if you need more information on how to get this blood test see the link descriptor Below in the comments and my team will help you arrange for that blood test my second tip to all the women that I love eat three fruits every day research has shown eat five servings of fruits and five servings of vegetables but to all the ladies out there I always say if I catch you on the road on the way to your office or on the way shopping if I look into your shopping bag I should see one apple carry a fruit peeler it's it's a great self-defense knife and you still can't get arrested because you're carrying a fruit peeler but the fruit peeler is for an apple a pear or an avocado that you can keep in your bag you see fruits represent the correct balance from nature in terms of sugar fruits also contain high amount of minerals you see we get sugar Cravings because of the micronutrient deficiency in our body so when you have these micronutrient deficiencies the body says from an ancient signaling point of view go and find foods that are salty or sweet and if you and I live 2,000 years ago the only salty or sweet Foods would come in the form of mineral salts from the rocks or the fruit hanging on trees so please make sure you eat three fruits a day point number three this is going to be a difficult one reduce your grains grains means things like rice wheat these grains were constructed in the agrarian society where women did a lot of Labor and hard work in today's desktop age where we are working on computers and sitting at offices and have cars and vehicles to fers around the place our entire energy expenditure is very low this is one of the main reasons why teenage girls are heavier and fatter we're putting too much of grain in their diet what I say to you our ancestors ate this much of rice this this much of Dal and this much of subzi what I suggest to you is learn this equation on the head eat this much of subzi eat This Much of Dal and eat only this much of grain because the whole perspective is grain is supposed to give you energy so reduce the portion and become aware what is the portion you do so by keeping a food diary you can over a period of 30 days slowly go from say 150 g of rice to 130 G of rice to 100 G of rice to 80 g of rice and before you know it maybe you're eating only 70 or 50 gam of rice and you're very happy with it because also your stomach shrinks in size my fourth point to all the women is you are in charge of the shopping in your house you are in charge of all the Staples purchases and food purchases in your house you see in today's day and age the farmers are using colossal amounts of insecticides and pesticides on the crop these chemicals play Havoc to your hormonal levels these chemicals affect your husband these chemicals affect your children so my suggestion to all the people who come to my nut Clinic is the first point is I don't want you to follow a diet before you follow a diet could you get purchasing on organic Point number five many of you may hate me for this point stop wearing your Cosmetics today's Cosmetics are loaded with hormone disruptors with chemicals that cause cancer they have beautiful smells and Beautiful Textures and they sold on smell and they're sold on touch feel and price I believe that our dadas had in icient Foods used as cosmetic on skins go back to those did you know that a lot of our Cosmetics are petroleum based petroleum meaning the fuel we put into our cars the byproduct of crude oil is that why could I not use coconut oil why could I not use beeswax many of these products there is no awareness therefore no demand and therefore not many producers or they're very expensive so whenever you choose your lipstick your eyeliner your mascara your creams make sure that they they do not have toxic Plastics they're not derived from crude oils and you know what if you look at the ingredients on your lipstick and cream you will realize half a dozen of them are chemicals so what should you do try and find people who manufacture creams and cosmetics organically and naturally Point number six staying with the chemicals many of us want beautiful smells in our house and the other day I was in a supermarket where somebody said sir we have these beautiful candles and it has lovely smells and what exotic names sunrise Orange and cinnamon Peach Apple blossoming I mean at the end of the day the words sound very appealing but I know that candles increase the volatile benzoic compounds in the air which affect your lungs women the lungs absorb a lot of pseudo estrogens so basically what we want to do is we want to avoid any sort of chemicals that are coming into the air think of candles as indoor pollution don't do them and if you want good smells in your house natural rhinds of oranges or lemons or P Puri which is old flowers that are dehydrated make sure no chemicals are added number seven you know me and my wife go shopping a lot of times and we're choosing more linen and cotton in our life the reason being is linen and cotton are natural Fabrics in your home your bed linen and the clothes that you wear as much as possible when you sleep try to switch to Pure cotton fabricc even the stitches in my cotton t-shirts and my wife's t-shirts are made with cotton thread so we're looking at it from organic perspective we're looking at it from a natural perspective research is showing that nylon and polyester based clothes have a hormonal impact have a cancer perspective on your body and therefore we steering clear of it I advise you to go natural in your fabric choices at least at home when you sleep for 8 hours and when you come back from Office take off all of your tight clothes that are constricting Your Health Point number eight this is common sense but buy the best water in the world and drink copious amounts of water you don't need beverages you don't need tea you don't need coffee you need good quality water don't wait till you're thirsty ensure you get 2 L of water as a woman every day 2 lit represent eight glasses of water when you get up first thing in the morning I recommend warmer water for a better bowel movement in case you're constipated don't worry about it you are not constipated research has shown that there are three types of people on the planet one who gets up in the morning and potties second who potties at any time of the day and third who potties at night don't believe that if your entire family parties in the morning and you poty at a different time of the day you're constipated as long as you get a bowel movement every 36 to 48 Hours you are not constipated ensure you drink more water so the stool that forms on your body is not dense and forms a plug additional water coupled with fiber which comes from your vegetables or fruit will help you have a better ball movement also your hormonal balance your blood chemistry balance your sweat production as well as your brain chemistry are all linked to better hydration Point number nine get an exercise wearable ring you know I've used the exercise trackers this gives you an indication of the number of steps the heart rate your stress levels I like the ring because it's non-invasive and I can even sleep with it at night you know the watch is invasive when I'm sleeping you know I turnover on my hand it hits my ear and it's quite uncomfortable but when it comes to the Rings they are giving me a perspective of incognito mode now how does a variable help you a variable helps every woman because I need every woman to get 12 to 15,000 steps a day this ensures as you grow older and your estrogen is dropping your body will store more fat if you want to maintain your figure you want to be exercising low intensity exercise works better in wearing an exercise varable you will be able to see your heart rate during a workout your heart rate at a lower intensity like Jadu POA walking yoga Pilates weight training is where you will burn more fat so the exercise variable is a crystal ball gazing into being in the best zone for your exercises and here comes my final tip tip number 10 this is a tip actually not for the ladies but for all their better halves you see recently I had my wife get a breast cancer Gene test done you know when I practiced in the quanan clinics we've had so many cases where women are not able to conceive and they undergo fertility treatment in the fertility treatment they do not do the breast cancer Gene to check their risk element and sometimes by doing fertility treatment or eating the wrong diets or taking the wrong supplements we may inadvertently activate the breast cancer Gene in that person because they have a higher risk element now what happens is if you have a higher incident have no fear medical results are there in terms of how do you change your diet how do you do your mamogram scans more often and how do you work preventively with your gynecologist or your oncologist in managing both your breast tissue and ovarian tissue as you get older and as you move towards menopause women you are the most expensive real estate on the planet you change the world you take care of your family it's your responsibility to take care of your health first I meet many women who take care of everybody else except
