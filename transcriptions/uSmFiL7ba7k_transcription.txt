I treat my body as a Rolls Royce and every year I get it tested to see how my engine is working. Health checkups are a great way to forward forecasts and strategize preventive measures in case of any anomalies.

[82.08 - 85.76] go through and then hopefully if you
[83.96 - 87.60] want to get these tests done reach out
[85.76 - 89.20] to me and we'll guide you to this
[87.60 - 91.96] wonderful city of Bangalore and how you

[91.96 - 96.20] half a day and um I'll diagnose your
[94.72 - 98.64] reports and figure out how we can change
[96.20 - 101.80] the way you eat all right so let's get a
[98.64 - 104.04] a stool sample today and a urine sample
[101.80 - 105.76] I've just given quick tip whenever
[104.04 - 107.60] you're doing your urine sample before
[105.76 - 111.48] you can come in for a health checkup or
[107.60 - 114.44] a blood test drink some water that will
[111.48 - 116.16] really help you about 1 hour prior to
[114.44 - 118.12] pass uh urine very easily because
[116.16 - 120.40] normally it's very cold and you get
[118.12 - 122.04] nervous and everything so so uh that's
[120.40 - 124.72] one thing second thing when you get the
[122.04 - 127.36] urine container before you pee both men
[124.72 - 131.56] and women open the container first keep
[127.36 - 135.40] it on the side right allow maybe 20 to
[131.56 - 138.56] 30 ml first of urine to pass then stop
[135.40 - 140.96] then take the cup and collect the urine
[138.56 - 143.36] okay especially in women the first pass
[140.96 - 144.80] may be contaminated so pee for a little
[143.36 - 147.44] bit so you need to have enough of water
[144.80 - 148.76] in you to get a consistent long flow ple
[147.44 - 150.84] and you have to squeeze your keegle
[148.76 - 152.08] muscles to stop your urine so whenever
[150.84 - 154.44] you know you're going for a blood test
[152.08 - 155.88] one week prior well just practice stop
[154.44 - 158.00] and go stop and go with your urine it's
[155.88 - 161.24] a lot of fun but don't spray it outside
[158.00 - 162.12] of the Basin for the men hi good morning
[161.24 - 165.32] please be
[162.12 - 168.64] seated we are at the place now where we
[165.32 - 171.40] are doing blood test now I you can do an
[168.64 - 173.52] annual Health checkup um which is very
[171.40 - 175.96] comprehensive on what I'm doing but I
[173.52 - 177.88] wouldest you know from my nutrition
[175.96 - 179.56] point of view I do a blood test every 6
[177.88 - 180.80] months you want to look at your lipid
[179.56 - 182.16] Pro profiles you want to look at your
[180.80 - 184.80] liver profile you want to look at your
[182.16 - 185.84] kidney profile and uh the heart profile
[184.80 - 188.44] the heart profile normally has
[185.84 - 190.92] homosysteine C reactive protein uh
[188.44 - 192.52] lipoprotein A lipoprotein B now if you
[190.92 - 195.88] do that in a blood test and you find
[192.52 - 198.52] higher markers uh or abnormal out of
[195.88 - 201.28] range levels you can use diet to control
[198.52 - 204.04] it over a period of time but if it's
[201.28 - 206.88] high go get an annual check check up
[204.04 - 209.52] done look at your calcium CT score uh
[206.88 - 211.04] look at an angiography look at um ECG
[209.52 - 213.31] but go to the heart guy and get that
[211.04 - 215.72] done so let's get my blood test
[213.31 - 218.44] [Music]
[215.72 - 222.00] done your blood pressure machine left or
[218.44 - 224.68] right any hand which you feel
[222.00 - 227.24] [Music]
[224.68 - 230.40] Comfort okay so it's a little higher it
[227.24 - 233.20] should be 120 over 80 so 138 maybe I'm
[230.40 - 233.20] super excited
[233.28 - 242.04] today older your um your blood vessels
[238.68 - 245.20] your blood vessels get get um narrower
[242.04 - 247.88] because of plaque deposition or just
[245.20 - 250.24] aging so imagine your pipelines getting
[247.88 - 252.88] harder and so that that what's going to
[250.24 - 254.80] happen is that um the heart has to pump
[252.88 - 255.64] because the blood vessel is not
[254.80 - 260.28] remaining
[255.64 - 262.96] elastic so collagen vitamin C Arginine
[260.28 - 266.24] arginine is found in green peas uh tends
[262.96 - 268.36] to dilate blood vessels uh which means
[266.24 - 270.96] uh which means it makes it more elastic
[268.36 - 272.80] so it can help in dietary management of
[270.96 - 274.96] BP and the other thing that we're
[272.80 - 278.88] looking at is we're always going to be
[274.96 - 281.28] looking at maybe you know uh high salt
[278.88 - 283.20] in the diet because of high salt uh
[281.28 - 285.52] obviously the body retains more amount
[283.20 - 287.28] of water and because you retain more
[285.52 - 290.36] amount of water the heart has to pump a
[287.28 - 292.76] little harder and faster to circulate
[290.36 - 295.16] that entire fuel stuff that's some
[292.76 - 297.52] serious blood coming out when I say
[295.16 - 299.16] serious not from a volume perspective
[297.52 - 300.80] but from the nutrition in that blood
[299.16 - 302.96] it's probably got Arginine as a
[300.80 - 307.16] supplement phosphoserine as a supplement
[302.96 - 311.28] vitamin C um ashwag gandha chamomile te
[307.16 - 311.28] and six oranges this
[311.68 - 317.52] morning I'm I'm going to you okay
[315.36 - 320.32] perfect what is the what is the ECG
[317.52 - 322.28] electrocardiogram you're seing your like
[320.32 - 323.60] hard Rhythm okay you're searching the
[322.28 - 327.04] rhythm of my heart I think my heart
[323.60 - 327.04] beats very well they
[328.48 - 331.88] have
[330.28 - 335.16] the health checkup is they ask you to
[331.88 - 337.28] relax so you shouldn't be um stressed
[335.16 - 339.56] out uh it's something that everyone
[337.28 - 341.44] above the age of 30 I recommend that
[339.56 - 343.64] they do considering nowadays we have a
[341.44 - 345.08] lot of heart attacks and a lot of
[343.64 - 349.20] diabetes hypertension because we all
[345.08 - 350.84] have a runrunrun life right so uh do an
[349.20 - 352.44] annual Health checkup it's really
[350.84 - 355.56] important for you and your family
[352.44 - 355.56] members let's get started
[358.48 - 361.48] sister
[374.11 - 377.22] [Music]
[382.48 - 388.40] matches and what the other small yeah
[386.44 - 391.40] you are really
[388.40 - 391.40] fashionable
[395.08 - 399.64] hey everyone I'm doing a CP scan and we
[397.76 - 404.12] going to check my internal organs it's a
[399.64 - 406.56] low intensity city scan right low low do
[404.12 - 407.92] okay so it's a low do radiation CD scan
[406.56 - 409.92] and the idea is to check up how my
[407.92 - 412.08] organs are doing so you can't come in
[409.92 - 413.88] here because it's radiation so stay safe
[412.08 - 417.80] I'll see you at find C
[413.88 - 420.44] SC my lungs got I hold my breath and let
[417.80 - 421.52] me check my heart has blockages so
[420.44 - 424.08] hopefully
[421.52 - 426.00] good may be good as a nutritionist a
[424.08 - 428.00] nutritionist can't have a heart block
[426.00 - 429.52] let's see so if I could afford this
[428.00 - 431.88] machine I would have it in my clinic
[429.52 - 434.96] it's called the dexas scan it's the gold
[431.88 - 437.24] standard for measuring body mass in
[434.96 - 438.68] human physiology and what do I mean by
[437.24 - 440.68] that everyone says oh I'm high weight
[438.68 - 442.96] I'm low weight but in your weight you
[440.68 - 445.24] have bone density you have muscle
[442.96 - 448.12] density you have water density and you
[445.24 - 450.40] have fat density with the dexa I'm very
[448.12 - 452.48] interested of you doing it once a year
[450.40 - 454.48] not every month like some crazy people
[452.48 - 456.84] do because it's too much of radiation
[454.48 - 458.52] every month once a year do this test
[456.84 - 460.84] you'll know your visceral fat visceral
[458.52 - 462.76] fat is the fat around the organs your
[460.84 - 465.44] subcutaneous fat which is fat Under the
[462.76 - 467.92] Skin and then you have your bone mass
[465.44 - 470.44] all women above the age of 30 have to do
[467.92 - 472.92] a bone mineral density test because with
[470.44 - 475.12] estrogen with menopause coming in early
[472.92 - 477.88] in the 40s and 50s your bones can get
[475.12 - 480.44] brittle for men after the age of 50 so
[477.88 - 482.08] I'm going to get myself done and uh I
[480.44 - 484.52] don't think he's allowed to be inside
[482.08 - 486.60] right because of the radiation right so
[484.52 - 488.60] again you got to leave me and I will
[486.60 - 490.76] share my DEA scan reports with all of
[488.60 - 494.52] you cheers scan done now I don't know
[490.76 - 497.72] what is next so hi I at the final stage
[494.52 - 499.64] of my annual checkup and I got to get my
[497.72 - 501.20] oral health checked out now as a
[499.64 - 503.04] nutritionist I've always been telling
[501.20 - 504.84] people brush their teeth because there
[503.04 - 506.88] was a research paper I read which says
[504.84 - 509.80] that you know um if you have block
[506.88 - 511.92] formation and bad oral microbiome
[509.80 - 515.04] it can affect your gut microbiome and it
[511.92 - 517.28] can lead to more block deposition at the
[515.04 - 519.88] at the Heart level so I have here with
[517.28 - 522.44] me Dr nin so Dr Narin here is going to
[519.88 - 524.48] do my oral test why am I doing this so

[537.20 - 541.52] a person do this screening the screening
