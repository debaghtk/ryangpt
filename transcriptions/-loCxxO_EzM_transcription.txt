Title: You need a human touch to bring behavioral change

Description: People all across the world are beginning to rely more and more on "digital" answers to everyday issues, and it appears that thinking is becoming less and less important. Our growing reliance on technology leads us to believe that there is nothing for which the internet cannot provide a solution. There are, though! The internet cannot teach you how to think, listen, or even smile! Face-to-face communication can improve social bonds with our neighbors, friends, coworkers, and other individuals we come into contact with during the day. In a way that texting and instant messaging do not, it recognizes their presence and their humanity. Having a discussion face-to-face is a rich experience that requires using memories, connections, mental images, associations, and answer selection. The best example is sports teams, where you can observe the genuine guidance and inspiration offered to each player by the support personnel.
