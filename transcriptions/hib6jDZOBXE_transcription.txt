[74.68 - 81.36] well-being and begin a New Journey
[78.28 - 83.48] towards a healthier more vibrant you all
[81.36 - 87.56] right let's get cracking with my
[83.48 - 90.44] architect a gentleman a fellow Goen a
[87.56 - 93.12] doctor with the double board certified
[90.44 - 96.72] in Psychiatry and sleep medicine Dr
[93.12 - 99.44] Shane Cado he's written in my opinion
[96.72 - 102.44] one of the best books I've ever read on
[99.44 - 104.60] sleep it's called Peak sleep performance
[102.44 - 107.16] for athlet I'm on The Cutting Edge of
[104.60 - 110.12] making athletes win and sleep is the new
[107.16 - 112.48] diet so Dr shade has studied he's got a
[110.12 - 114.44] Bachelor's in physical therapy and then
[112.48 - 116.60] he went on to do an MD I don't think
[114.44 - 118.40] that was enough and he graduated at the
[116.60 - 120.40] top of his class so you know whenever I
[118.40 - 122.32] recruit people uh in into the qua
[120.40 - 123.80] nutrition clinics I'm always looking how
[122.32 - 125.08] good they were in school not in the
[123.80 - 127.36] subject matter but where did they
[125.08 - 129.92] graduate and so he's got the gold medal
[127.36 - 132.44] in every possible standard and he
[129.92 - 134.52] completed his Psychiatry residency uh
[132.44 - 137.72] training at the University of Wisconsin
[134.52 - 140.64] that was not what CAU my eye what CAU my
[137.72 - 142.48] eye is he's on the board of directors of
[140.64 - 145.72] the international Society for sports
[142.48 - 148.16] Psychiatry and sports players really in
[145.72 - 150.28] today's world have so much of pressure
[148.16 - 152.12] that just giving them a diet is not good
[150.28 - 154.12] enough and if you take the pressures of
[152.12 - 156.68] sport and you bring that into your daily
[154.12 - 159.44] life I think everyone has some sort of
[156.68 - 161.84] mental pressure biochemistry pressure
[159.44 - 164.16] physical pressure so I think Dr Shane
[161.84 - 166.72] would be the right person to get into
[164.16 - 168.92] heated topic where the mind will not
[166.72 - 170.72] overheat but we'll get certain Snippets
[168.92 - 172.56] and shots from him on how we can get to
[170.72 - 175.44] the next level now he's been associated
[172.56 - 178.04] with the Amen Clinics Dr Daniel Aman is
[175.44 - 180.56] a guru that I follow from the brain
[178.04 - 182.56] perspective and I get to follow him on
[180.56 - 184.20] the internet but Dr Shane gets to
[182.56 - 186.36] practice with this gentleman at the Aman
[184.20 - 188.00] clinics he's also part of the NBA
[186.36 - 190.40] Players Association the Australian
[188.00 - 192.24] football league the US Olympic and Par
[190.40 - 194.56] Olympic Committee the Miami Heats the
[192.24 - 196.68] Chicago Blackhawks and get this the Rafa
[194.56 - 198.80] Nadal Academy and so much more now why
[196.68 - 202.56] do I want him talking to us about health
[198.80 - 204.72] shots today is basically hey Dr Shane is
[202.56 - 207.60] in my opinion the Sleep Guru of the
[204.72 - 209.96] world so without further Ado Dr Shane
[207.60 - 211.56] are you there and hi good evening or
[209.96 - 213.60] good afternoon where are you speaking to
[211.56 - 216.28] me from Ryan thank you for that warm
[213.60 - 218.00] warm welcome I'm so happy to be here I'm
[216.28 - 219.76] talking to you from Chicago so it's a
[218.00 - 222.36] good morning to me and a good evening to
[219.76 - 224.12] you sir wonderful so let's get cracking
[222.36 - 226.04] I've I've got this whole list of
[224.12 - 228.76] questions that have been asked by my
[226.04 - 230.84] fans here in this part of the world so
[228.76 - 232.80] the first one why did you become a sleep
[230.84 - 235.16] doctor I mean you did Psychiatry but
[232.80 - 237.96] sleep doctor did you get enough sleep
[235.16 - 240.12] studying so much in college I got hardly
[237.96 - 242.84] any sleep in my medical prac practice
[240.12 - 245.80] which is one reason why I was fascinated
[242.84 - 248.48] with sleep but no really when we do
[245.80 - 251.08] Psychiatry training on medical training
[248.48 - 253.88] there's little to no focus on sleep and
[251.08 - 255.92] there's a massive overlap between as
[253.88 - 258.64] we'll talk about between sleep and
[255.92 - 261.20] mental health issues and General Health
[258.64 - 263.12] as well and I was staring my hair out
[261.20 - 265.48] saying why are we not learning more
[263.12 - 267.92] about sleep not just oh let's print out
[265.48 - 269.84] something from Google everyone gets
[267.92 - 272.96] eight hours but the impact of things
[269.84 - 274.56] like sleep apnea insomnia shift work on
[272.96 - 277.44] your overall health your lifestyle your
[274.56 - 279.60] quality of life concentration me mental
[277.44 - 281.56] health as well as athletic performance
[279.60 - 283.68] and so I decided to do a sleep medicine
[281.56 - 285.36] Fellowship an additional training after
[283.68 - 286.92] Psychiatry and then working with
[285.36 - 289.24] athletes and sports Psychiatry I
[286.92 - 291.40] realized even the elite athletes the
[289.24 - 293.64] sports teams the national teams going to
[291.40 - 296.08] the Olympics were not focusing on sleep
[293.64 - 298.28] in a personalized Precision driven way
[296.08 - 300.40] the way you do with nutrition and your
[298.28 - 302.32] Elite athletes the way that people focus
[300.40 - 304.00] on mental conditioning coaching or
[302.32 - 305.68] physical training they were forgetting
[304.00 - 307.00] about a personalized approach to sleep
[305.68 - 309.12] and so I said I'm just going to write a
[307.00 - 311.48] book on this stuff put it all together
[309.12 - 313.68] and kind of like create that awareness
[311.48 - 316.32] in different teams and leagues and
[313.68 - 319.40] organizations around the world so that's
[316.32 - 321.92] my mission to show people that everyone
[319.40 - 323.88] can utilize these basic sleep strategies
[321.92 - 325.48] understand your natural rhythms retra
[323.88 - 327.64] your brain and it's going to have a
[325.48 - 330.40] downstream effect of reducing disease
[327.64 - 332.08] burden across the board especially
[330.40 - 334.60] considering that it's such a prevalent
[332.08 - 336.08] issue in India awesome so let's get
[334.60 - 338.00] cracking and let's see what are the main
[336.08 - 340.88] questions that me and my listeners have
[338.00 - 343.44] asked in now the first one why is sleep
[340.88 - 345.24] important for us and why eight hours is
[343.44 - 347.80] it this like onethird eight hours you
[345.24 - 348.96] sleep one3 you work and one3 you faf
[347.80 - 351.04] around what's the whole thing about
[348.96 - 353.08] sleep yeah so it's a little more Nuance
[351.04 - 355.20] than that right the purpose of sleeping
[353.08 - 357.04] is still poorly understood however there
[355.20 - 359.48] are multiple theories and we know that
[357.04 - 362.00] there's Direct effects on every aspect
[359.48 - 364.24] ECT of our health our nervous system our
[362.00 - 368.60] cardiovascular system our immune system
[364.24 - 371.04] our GI system our brain health so sleep
[368.60 - 372.76] is important for us only because
[371.04 - 376.28] essential for survival even when they
[372.76 - 379.88] look at AI models now the AI models need
[376.28 - 382.76] their sleep so in terms of deep sleep
[379.88 - 386.44] and dream sleep broadly speaking deep
[382.76 - 388.68] sleep is necessary to flush out toxins
[386.44 - 391.32] that build up in the brain through the
[388.68 - 394.88] drainage called the glymphatic system
[391.32 - 397.12] that was only discovered in 2004 2005 so
[394.88 - 400.00] pretty recently and if you don't get
[397.12 - 402.80] enough deep sleep or non-rem sleep
[400.00 - 404.60] toxins build up and directly correlate
[402.80 - 407.40] with Alzheimer's and other kinds of
[404.60 - 409.80] dementias where is so do this deep this
[407.40 - 412.64] deep sleep is is it also known as the S
[409.80 - 415.04] SWS sleep slow wave sleep or non-ramp
[412.64 - 417.96] sleep that's absolutely right yes okay
[415.04 - 420.72] so if an athlete is measuring this and
[417.96 - 422.40] their devices are looking at Deep Sleep
[420.72 - 424.88] we're talking about the deep sleep or
[422.40 - 430.16] the S SWS sleep yes and most of the
[424.88 - 432.88] devic market is REM sleep or dream sleep
[430.16 - 435.56] and dream sleep is necessary for memory
[432.88 - 437.56] consolidation New learnings working
[435.56 - 439.16] memory and so if you're not getting
[437.56 - 441.20] sufficient dream sleep you're not
[439.16 - 443.48] consolidating the learnings from the
[441.20 - 445.04] previous day how would that help an
[443.48 - 447.36] athlete I mean an athlete just is to
[445.04 - 448.84] repeat stuff and go out and kick a ball
[447.36 - 450.60] or throw a ball so what learning is
[448.84 - 453.44] there so I mean you also work with
[450.60 - 455.48] athletes so yeah maybe I get so what
[453.44 - 457.04] comes first I'm I'm behaving like an
[455.48 - 459.64] athlete does the dream sleep come first
[457.04 - 461.80] the REM sleep comes first can I can I
[459.64 - 464.16] give up one of these guys because you
[461.80 - 466.00] know I want to watch Netflix or I got to
[464.16 - 467.36] catch a flight to go for a competition
[466.00 - 470.00] tomorrow and I don't want to go a day
[467.36 - 471.96] prior so what's it like yeah the first
[470.00 - 473.80] half of the night is more deep sleep for
[471.96 - 475.88] you're flushing out toxins cleansing
[473.80 - 478.56] your brain in the later half the night
[475.88 - 480.56] you have more dream sleep so why is it
[478.56 - 483.36] important because the same areas that
[480.56 - 486.00] control dream sleep are also necessary
[483.36 - 487.80] for emotional stability think about
[486.00 - 489.48] mental resilience mental conditioning
[487.80 - 491.64] coaching think about the plays you
[489.48 - 493.92] learned from the previous day if your
[491.64 - 496.68] opponent or your opposing team certain
[493.92 - 498.96] plays usually use your coach your team
[496.68 - 500.40] will sit down and say well this is some
[498.96 - 503.20] strategy you want to figure out
[500.40 - 507.08] especially tennis one-on-one players so
[503.20 - 509.72] if you don't get enough deep and dream
[507.08 - 511.20] sleep you're not going to be able to be
[509.72 - 512.60] able to function effectively the next
[511.20 - 514.60] day and how effective is this there's
[512.60 - 517.72] studies that show this as well so
[514.60 - 519.64] Matthew Walker did this study with
[517.72 - 521.40] depriving people of sleep versus people
[519.64 - 523.72] who got eight hours of sleep in a given
[521.40 - 526.36] night the next day their ability to
[523.72 - 528.76] retain new information dropped
[526.36 - 530.80] 40% so what's the difference hang so
[528.76 - 535.24] let's let's summarize that if I don't
[530.80 - 539.48] sleep well my ability to learn the next
[535.24 - 542.08] day drops by 40% that's right so a lot
[539.48 - 543.88] of people who deprive so does this apply
[542.08 - 545.92] only to athletes or this applies to even
[543.88 - 549.88] corporate workers and even you and me
[545.92 - 552.76] every single person so what do I read in
[549.88 - 554.72] your book and I highlighted this point
[552.76 - 557.56] and everyone should get your book if
[554.72 - 560.88] they're an athlete you wrote that for
[557.56 - 564.52] every 1.5 hours of sleep production
[560.88 - 568.76] daytime alertness drops by
[564.52 - 571.24] 32% yes so should I sleep 6 hours should
[568.76 - 575.16] I sleep 8 hours should I sleep 10 hours
[571.24 - 578.48] I go by sleep cycles of 90 minutes each
[575.16 - 582.40] not by hours anymore please enlighten me
[578.48 - 585.20] on this yes absolutely so one sleep
[582.40 - 587.56] cycle which includes deep dream light
[585.20 - 591.16] sleep is around 90 minutes for the
[587.56 - 595.12] average person so 7 and 1 half hours of
[591.16 - 598.92] sleep is five sleep cycles of 90 minutes
[595.12 - 600.60] each most adults need around 7 and a
[598.92 - 603.20] half hours of
[600.60 - 606.00] sleep if you're younger if you're a
[603.20 - 608.36] teenager you need closer to 9 or 10
[606.00 - 610.12] hours of sleep one second so are you
[608.36 - 612.96] saying the younger you are the more
[610.12 - 614.24] sleep you need yes look at baby my son
[612.96 - 615.68] is going to school he's going for
[614.24 - 618.00] tutions he to get up in the morning he
[615.68 - 619.52] just get seven hours of sleep yeah I
[618.00 - 621.48] used to do the same thing and I look
[619.52 - 623.36] back and say what was I doing I was in
[621.48 - 627.12] Stannis laws and bandra and running
[623.36 - 629.72] around with tutions and classes it will
[627.12 - 632.28] not only reduce your ability to learn
[629.72 - 634.80] new things when we see the brain scans
[632.28 - 637.40] in the Amen Clinics the areas of the
[634.80 - 639.76] frontal lobe the the temporal lobe the
[637.40 - 642.40] back of the brain are affected with
[639.76 - 645.32] chronic sleep loss the same way our head
[642.40 - 648.20] injury patients are affected brain wise
[645.32 - 649.72] w so are you saying that you know the
[648.20 - 652.24] kids that come to me who are between the
[649.72 - 654.96] ages of say five and 15 for Sports
[652.24 - 656.88] Nutrition they should be sleeping more
[654.96 - 658.84] because if they don't sleep more their
[656.88 - 662.00] brain scans if he did one would show the
[658.84 - 663.72] same as traumatic head injury yes and
[662.00 - 665.72] why is that therefore we should not
[663.72 - 669.00] compromise on sleep but compromise on
[665.72 - 672.08] tutions and playtime and sleep more yes
[669.00 - 673.88] so 40% reduction in your memory
[672.08 - 676.04] consolidation it's like you're being
[673.88 - 677.88] sleep deprived your brain is a sponge
[676.04 - 681.20] that's already soaked it's not dry
[677.88 - 684.24] enough to take up new information now
[681.20 - 686.56] the old knowledge was that after you
[684.24 - 690.44] learn something you need to sleep to
[686.56 - 694.24] consolidate the memories yes 100% true
[690.44 - 699.28] but now we know for a fact that if your
[694.24 - 700.92] brain isn't adequately sleep fed you're
[699.28 - 703.72] not going to be able to learn anything
[700.92 - 707.96] new or even retain what you already
[703.72 - 709.76] learned I love that term sleep fed that
[707.96 - 711.12] we've learned it wrong I bet he did it
[709.76 - 713.08] wrong and I did it wrong by studying
[711.12 - 715.16] late night into exams and we didn't have
[713.08 - 717.68] more memory it's just stupidity without
[715.16 - 721.60] brain scans and modern doctors like Dr
[717.68 - 725.08] shanes so Dr Shane says let's sleep feed
[721.60 - 727.40] our brain and smaller children teenagers
[725.08 - 728.52] need more sleep than adults and
[727.40 - 731.20] everything is in the learning and
[728.52 - 732.88] there's a 40% reduction okay I'm sorry
[731.20 - 735.76] I'm affecting your Flow State but I had
[732.88 - 738.40] a question on Flow which was some one of
[735.76 - 741.60] my clients message he says how will
[738.40 - 744.40] sleeping better affect my flow State and
[741.60 - 746.64] how is the state uh beneficial for
[744.40 - 748.28] maximum efficiency now I don't I don't
[746.64 - 750.48] understand whether they mean flow State
[748.28 - 752.88] as an athlete of Flow State of sleep
[750.48 - 755.84] what do you feel is the question here
[752.88 - 758.04] okay so flow state has been popularized
[755.84 - 760.32] by Stephen Cotler as we know he's
[758.04 - 764.88] written really good books including the
[760.32 - 767.00] rise of Superman and flow state is
[764.88 - 768.92] considered a state in which Malcolm
[767.00 - 771.16] Gladwell speaks about this Brandy Brown
[768.92 - 773.92] speaks about this where you have more
[771.16 - 777.04] mental Clarity creativity and very fast
[773.92 - 779.40] decision making more intuition takes
[777.04 - 781.28] over your conscious thinking
[779.40 - 784.04] so when you look at Elite athletes when
[781.28 - 787.20] you look at suin and his matches s then
[784.04 - 789.80] when you look at alarz or feder or
[787.20 - 791.52] jokovic they just click into something
[789.80 - 794.64] else you see it you notice it from the
[791.52 - 798.36] outside but internally they just driving
[794.64 - 800.80] on intuition that's Flow State where you
[798.36 - 802.64] have a wealth of experience now you're
[800.80 - 804.48] going to the quantum level rather than
[802.64 - 806.20] the binary level is what I think about I
[804.48 - 808.92] think about the conscious brain as a
[806.20 - 811.44] binary computer the subconscious brain
[808.92 - 814.04] as a quantum computer so that's what
[811.44 - 816.88] flow state is now in terms of brain
[814.04 - 819.00] waves three primary brain waves come
[816.88 - 822.60] into play when it comes to Flow State
[819.00 - 824.64] Theta Alpha and Gamma and there's
[822.60 - 826.24] different frequencies of how fast your
[824.64 - 828.44] brain is cycling to get into those
[826.24 - 830.88] States so Theta is when you're deeply
[828.44 - 833.24] relaxed Alpha is when you're alert yet
[830.88 - 835.24] calm and Gamma is when you're in deep
[833.24 - 837.60] concentration so some combination of
[835.24 - 841.24] those three results in intuition taking
[837.60 - 843.16] over conscious thinking and it might
[841.24 - 846.16] manifest his reaction times mental
[843.16 - 849.00] reaction times physical reaction times
[846.16 - 852.28] we know that sleep the right amount of
[849.00 - 854.48] quality sleep not just quantity can
[852.28 - 857.64] actually have you work sharper be more
[854.48 - 860.88] efficient your reaction times can drop
[857.64 - 863.00] by 300% with little to no sleep a given
[860.88 - 865.92] night so think about the athletes when
[863.00 - 868.40] it comes to traveling time zones jet lag
[865.92 - 870.88] travel fatigue but what about you and
[868.40 - 872.68] your daily life what about driving to
[870.88 - 875.08] work what about your reaction times and
[872.68 - 876.84] risk of car accidents a small study
[875.08 - 878.76] showed that in daylight savings time
[876.84 - 881.48] year in the US when you lose an hour of
[878.76 - 885.32] sleep in March the next day there's a
[881.48 - 888.44] 21% increased risk of heart attacks and
[885.32 - 891.16] in the fall in the Autumn when we gain
[888.44 - 894.20] an hour of sleep when the times shift
[891.16 - 897.56] there's around a 20 to 24% drop in the
[894.20 - 899.04] heart attacks the next day car accidents
[897.56 - 900.56] much worse the day after after you've
[899.04 - 903.00] lost that hour of sleep because of the
[900.56 - 905.80] reaction times think about that in the
[903.00 - 908.12] pandemic everyone worked from home and
[905.80 - 909.24] everyone binged to watch Netflix and
[908.12 - 911.76] because they didn't have to travel to
[909.24 - 914.00] work they slept a little shorter and
[911.76 - 917.52] watched TV longer got lesser sleep and
[914.00 - 920.00] we had more uh cardiovascular incidences
[917.52 - 922.52] post pandemic there we are now you know
[920.00 - 924.60] why very very very interesting okay I'm
[922.52 - 927.52] going to go to the next question which
[924.60 - 930.28] is uh about you being a specialist in
[927.52 - 934.72] this field as a sleep doctors a sports
[930.28 - 936.96] psychiatrist in your field of practice
[934.72 - 938.92] have you found out that something that
[936.96 - 941.16] nobody else has kind of found the link
[938.92 - 943.76] like for example could the gut
[941.16 - 946.16] microbiome influence your brain and
[943.76 - 948.72] thinking capability and sleep or is
[946.16 - 950.56] there something very unique that you
[948.72 - 954.24] have found that you want to share with
[950.56 - 957.60] us oh speaking of the gut microbiome
[954.24 - 960.20] 100% the gut produces 75% for
[957.60 - 963.28] neurotransmitter so think serotonin
[960.20 - 965.64] dopamine orrine or adrenaline and it
[963.28 - 967.68] also is 80% of your immune system I'm
[965.64 - 970.24] going to keep interrupting over here so
[967.68 - 972.20] if my gut's producing 75% of my
[970.24 - 973.80] neurotransmitters the signals that my
[972.20 - 976.24] brain gets the chemicals that my brain
[973.80 - 977.64] gets it's been produces my gut so my gut
[976.24 - 980.36] is connected to my brain that's what
[977.64 - 982.68] you're saying uh yes okay hang on so if
[980.36 - 985.12] I'm mentally depressed it's not in my
[982.68 - 987.08] brain it's coming from my gut mostly
[985.12 - 989.80] from your gut so in your book you've
[987.08 - 992.32] written about junk food and so junk food
[989.80 - 994.92] is my department people eat protein C
[992.32 - 996.76] fats and you've written about this so I
[994.92 - 999.40] I want you to explain to me about the
[996.76 - 1003.24] microbiome the gut neurotransmitter and
[999.40 - 1006.40] about this study in Upsala University in
[1003.24 - 1008.16] Sweden about the two different types of
[1006.40 - 1010.12] food which is basically normal food and
[1008.16 - 1011.76] a little bit of a junk food and could
[1010.12 - 1014.80] you throw a little bit light on how
[1011.76 - 1017.36] that's affected people yeah so the gut
[1014.80 - 1019.84] microbiome has a bunch of bacteria and
[1017.36 - 1022.08] other things that need to be in healthy
[1019.84 - 1024.20] amounts so the healthy bacteria the top
[1022.08 - 1027.00] four healthy bacteria in our gut produce
[1024.20 - 1030.48] a B vitamins be for boy they also need
[1027.00 - 1032.20] Vitamin D D for dog in order to survive
[1030.48 - 1033.96] they can't make their own vitamin D as
[1032.20 - 1035.96] we all know so I'm preaching the choir
[1033.96 - 1037.76] over here so please stop me interrupt me
[1035.96 - 1039.72] correct me at any time when those
[1037.76 - 1041.24] bacteria produce B vitamins B vitamins
[1039.72 - 1043.40] are responsible for red blood cell
[1041.24 - 1044.92] production and nervous system help
[1043.40 - 1047.44] that's why pregnant women are asked to
[1044.92 - 1049.68] take more bead vitamins more folate for
[1047.44 - 1051.84] the neural development M the nervous
[1049.68 - 1054.12] system of the fetus so if you're not
[1051.84 - 1056.52] getting enough vitamin D or not having
[1054.12 - 1057.80] healthy amounts of healthy bacteria
[1056.52 - 1060.76] what's going to take over the unhealthy
[1057.80 - 1062.60] bacteria or disbiosis in the nutrition
[1060.76 - 1065.36] world and then that's going to result in
[1062.60 - 1067.96] a complete catastrophe Cascade as I like
[1065.36 - 1070.48] to call it where inflammation worsens
[1067.96 - 1072.68] leaky gut happens neurotransmitters go
[1070.48 - 1074.16] out of whack and then your body doesn't
[1072.68 - 1075.68] have the raw materials and ingredients
[1074.16 - 1077.92] it needs to make healthy amounts of
[1075.68 - 1080.52] neurotransmitters and hormones so that's
[1077.92 - 1083.56] amazing so now I'm suddenly thinking
[1080.52 - 1086.12] people who are depressed people who have
[1083.56 - 1089.92] anxiety people who just are constantly
[1086.12 - 1093.28] stressed out one is sleep is the new
[1089.92 - 1095.20] diet and diet is also slapping your gut
[1093.28 - 1097.40] which is slapping your brain does it
[1095.20 - 1099.08] also affect your sleep so I'm like okay
[1097.40 - 1101.76] I don't get enough of sleep but then I
[1099.08 - 1106.08] also eat bad so is eating bad also
[1101.76 - 1108.56] affecting the Sleep 100% so the gut
[1106.08 - 1111.52] microbiome also influences your sleep in
[1108.56 - 1114.12] a major major way they've done studies
[1111.52 - 1116.76] on feal transplants in rats where they
[1114.12 - 1119.80] take some feces put it in another rat
[1116.76 - 1123.32] and they can actually induce diseases
[1119.80 - 1126.08] like insomnia and narcolepsy where
[1123.32 - 1128.80] people just sleep too much just with
[1126.08 - 1130.52] changing the microbiome So when you say
[1128.80 - 1132.84] it's a gut feeling it's more like
[1130.52 - 1134.56] feeling is gut it's amazing that you
[1132.84 - 1137.00] talk about this because you know I've
[1134.56 - 1139.24] been practicing for two decades now and
[1137.00 - 1140.92] uh at a quad nutrition clinics we do
[1139.24 - 1144.08] something which is bioindividual and
[1140.92 - 1146.04] neutr genomics since 2010 microbiome
[1144.08 - 1148.80] testing about 5 years ago when it first
[1146.04 - 1150.92] started that's way ahead of the game wow
[1148.80 - 1153.24] so the the idea was bio individuality so
[1150.92 - 1155.12] I always believed Dr Shane that each
[1153.24 - 1157.40] person was a scientific study in their
[1155.12 - 1159.80] own right so like in the Upsala
[1157.40 - 1161.64] University study I remember reading that
[1159.80 - 1165.16] and thank you for sharing that article
[1161.64 - 1168.28] with me and my conclusion from that was
[1165.16 - 1169.80] everyone binge eats on the weekend
[1168.28 - 1173.52] Friday Saturday
[1169.80 - 1175.52] Sunday so it's high fat high sugar diets
[1173.52 - 1178.52] obviously alcohol and everything in that
[1175.52 - 1182.96] period and then the study said that the
[1178.52 - 1185.52] Deep wave sleep the sign wave sleep was
[1182.96 - 1187.72] much more erratic and lesser now I
[1185.52 - 1189.52] remember when uh athletes were doing
[1187.72 - 1191.84] hypertrophic training and they had to do
[1189.52 - 1193.48] faster recovery because we had just a
[1191.84 - 1196.16] short period of time let's say between
[1193.48 - 1198.60] the IPL and them going onto the World
[1196.16 - 1200.60] Cup the Mandate was the more more my
[1198.60 - 1202.52] cricketer gets deep sleep sine wave
[1200.60 - 1205.00] sleep so the sine wave sleep correct me
[1202.52 - 1206.56] if I'm wrong releases more stem cells
[1205.00 - 1208.56] yes which is the Rejuvenation of the
[1206.56 - 1211.04] human body which is a Rejuvenation so
[1208.56 - 1213.24] when people eat the junk food the sine
[1211.04 - 1215.68] wave sleep gets short circuited and so I
[1213.24 - 1217.44] was just thinking hey so I'm getting so
[1215.68 - 1219.12] it says that there was no difference in
[1217.44 - 1220.96] the number of hours of sleep but there
[1219.12 - 1223.44] was some issue on the sign and I was
[1220.96 - 1225.76] like okay so that really is your beauty
[1223.44 - 1227.72] sleep that really is what's affecting
[1225.76 - 1229.76] you and this is the reason why I think
[1227.72 - 1232.52] everyone turns up on Monday morning
[1229.76 - 1234.96] feeling demotivated to work no matter
[1232.52 - 1237.16] their profession and it's not that they
[1234.96 - 1240.08] hate their job it's just that they did
[1237.16 - 1242.28] not understand that they short circuited
[1240.08 - 1244.60] their diet their diet short circuited
[1242.28 - 1246.84] their sleep their sleep short circuited
[1244.60 - 1248.68] their will for going to work the next
[1246.84 - 1251.92] day and therefore their daytime
[1248.68 - 1253.92] alertness dropped by what you said 32%
[1251.92 - 1256.40] memory and learning dropped by 40% so
[1253.92 - 1258.12] I'm a zombie on Monday morning yeah
[1256.40 - 1260.64] you're essentially functioning as if
[1258.12 - 1263.52] you're jet lag the jet lag zombie and
[1260.64 - 1265.28] because sorry and so you're jet lag so
[1263.52 - 1267.44] when you're speaking of jet lag and when
[1265.28 - 1269.36] people come to you for brain scans I'm
[1267.44 - 1272.48] sure you get a lot of people who take
[1269.36 - 1274.92] the Exotic stuff the alcohols and the
[1272.48 - 1276.80] weeds and the Cannabis and all of this
[1274.92 - 1278.16] stuff and I do have athletes asking me
[1276.80 - 1279.84] Ryan what's your opinion you know and
[1278.16 - 1281.28] I'm like listen I'm on the Olympic doing
[1279.84 - 1282.84] committee you're not supposed to take
[1281.28 - 1284.76] this stuff do you know you can get it
[1282.84 - 1288.16] even in the fumes so you shouldn't be
[1284.76 - 1290.48] around people with the fumes what's your
[1288.16 - 1293.68] scientific take for us to convince
[1290.48 - 1296.48] people that alcohol in my opinion should
[1293.68 - 1298.68] have surgeons warning Dr Shane C's
[1296.48 - 1300.28] warning alcohol consumption is injurious
[1298.68 - 1303.64] to your heal what's your take on this am
[1300.28 - 1305.96] I wrong you're 100% right so you can
[1303.64 - 1307.80] talk about alcohol affecting the gut
[1305.96 - 1309.56] that's your expertise you can talk about
[1307.80 - 1311.96] alcohol damaging the brain the same
[1309.56 - 1314.48] patterns we see on head injuries and
[1311.96 - 1316.68] chronic sleep problems we see in Spec
[1314.48 - 1319.96] images with alcohol use it looks like a
[1316.68 - 1323.20] head injured like a brain injury now
[1319.96 - 1325.24] alcohol also while it may be sedating so
[1323.20 - 1327.32] it may help you fall asleep it's going
[1325.24 - 1329.96] to fragment that deep sleep that you
[1327.32 - 1333.40] spoke about earlier so sleep
[1329.96 - 1334.68] fragmentation means bad quality sleep
[1333.40 - 1337.16] which means your brain is not going to
[1334.68 - 1339.48] flush toxins out but people say they
[1337.16 - 1341.28] drink alcohol and they sleep better they
[1339.48 - 1343.52] fall asleep okay but they're going to
[1341.28 - 1345.28] wake up in the middle of the night or
[1343.52 - 1347.12] they might not even be aware of the fact
[1345.28 - 1349.60] that their brain is Wake woken up
[1347.12 - 1351.44] because if your brain wakes up for maybe
[1349.60 - 1354.04] three seconds or less and goes back to
[1351.44 - 1356.08] sleep you won't be consciously aware
[1354.04 - 1358.84] that it woke up but it may do that
[1356.08 - 1360.56] throughout the night and you may wake up
[1358.84 - 1363.52] not remember sleep scientist you're able
[1360.56 - 1365.20] to see this in a sleep lab exactly and
[1363.52 - 1368.12] you may wake up not remembering but you
[1365.20 - 1370.72] may feel terrible the next day what's a
[1368.12 - 1372.96] hangover what is feeling like crap the
[1370.72 - 1375.44] next day after you've had nine hours of
[1372.96 - 1377.76] sleep but five drinks the previous night
[1375.44 - 1378.96] it's poor quality sleep so we know that
[1377.76 - 1380.48] you know know I work with a lot of
[1378.96 - 1383.04] celebrities you work with a lot of
[1380.48 - 1384.40] celebrities we can't take names right so
[1383.04 - 1386.00] I can't take names of who's got a
[1384.40 - 1387.28] six-pack and what protein powerder I've
[1386.00 - 1390.44] give them and you can't tell me who's
[1387.28 - 1393.60] like a alcoholic but in the field of
[1390.44 - 1395.68] celebrity and the pressure to go and
[1393.60 - 1398.72] party and stuff like that have you
[1395.68 - 1400.80] actually done and seen wherein people
[1398.72 - 1402.84] have these scans done and then they
[1400.80 - 1405.56] decide to follow your diet which is the
[1402.84 - 1407.72] Sleep diet your diet which is reduction
[1405.56 - 1409.92] in alcohol or abstinence from alcohol
[1407.72 - 1411.32] and do you have a before and after scan
[1409.92 - 1412.92] and is there any information that you
[1411.32 - 1414.64] can share with our viewers will
[1412.92 - 1416.68] understand that there's no Hocus Pocus
[1414.64 - 1419.96] of these two guys talking about there
[1416.68 - 1421.84] actual proper Diagnostics to say that
[1419.96 - 1425.08] there is a massive Improvement in a
[1421.84 - 1428.08] person's condition yes there is and so
[1425.08 - 1429.20] we can look at improvements in terms of
[1428.08 - 1433.12] cognitive
[1429.20 - 1436.56] testing emotional testing subjective
[1433.12 - 1439.56] symptoms that they've reported sleep
[1436.56 - 1441.64] testing bio bi mockers like blood test
[1439.56 - 1445.00] like testosterone levels get
[1441.64 - 1446.56] boosted inflammation mockers come down
[1445.00 - 1449.00] cholesterol and blood sugar level
[1446.56 - 1452.00] markers come down and imaging
[1449.00 - 1453.68] verification on spec images before and
[1452.00 - 1455.96] after they've implemented a brain
[1453.68 - 1457.56] healthy protocol which includes the kind
[1455.96 - 1460.44] of nutrition work you do and the kind of
[1457.56 - 1464.12] sleep work I do we've seen brains look
[1460.44 - 1466.84] healthier and younger over time with
[1464.12 - 1468.84] changing our diets and our sleep because
[1466.84 - 1471.48] those things are mod iable which is
[1468.84 - 1473.00] what's so beautiful about it you know
[1471.48 - 1474.28] doc I've not even gone through half the
[1473.00 - 1476.68] questions that I have to do so we are
[1474.28 - 1479.04] going to do part two shortly but before
[1476.68 - 1480.92] we let you go and we come back again for
[1479.04 - 1483.04] part two I want to ask you a few
[1480.92 - 1485.36] questions staying with nutrition does
[1483.04 - 1487.92] hydration play an important role in the
[1485.36 - 1490.88] quality and duration of sleep and should
[1487.92 - 1494.28] we stop all fluids before bedtime and
[1490.88 - 1496.60] what is the last time to eat before you
[1494.28 - 1498.24] go to sleep so once hydration is it
[1496.60 - 1499.56] important should be stop stop fluids
[1498.24 - 1502.32] before going to bed and when's the last
[1499.56 - 1505.92] meal should we eat before going to bed
[1502.32 - 1508.04] hydration is extremely important make
[1505.92 - 1509.44] sure that your urine is clear looking
[1508.04 - 1512.64] like water then you know you're
[1509.44 - 1515.28] adequately hydrated why is it important
[1512.64 - 1517.60] it's because if your brain is partially
[1515.28 - 1519.72] even partially if your body is partially
[1517.60 - 1522.32] dehydrated your body is going to release
[1519.72 - 1525.48] more stress hormone cortisol so
[1522.32 - 1527.88] dehydration less blood volume cortisol
[1525.48 - 1529.88] tightens up the blood vessels so you can
[1527.88 - 1532.28] maintain your healthy blood pressure but
[1529.88 - 1534.80] stress hormones like cortisol disrupt
[1532.28 - 1537.76] your sleep chronic stress hormone
[1534.80 - 1539.44] release chronic dehydration results in
[1537.76 - 1541.64] shrinking of the gray matter in the
[1539.44 - 1544.56] brain which is necessary for memory
[1541.64 - 1546.52] executive functioning wow so that's how
[1544.56 - 1549.16] important hydration is and also
[1546.52 - 1551.36] hydration with the right electrolytes
[1549.16 - 1553.68] right sodium potassium being the primary
[1551.36 - 1555.20] ones now when should we stop fluids
[1553.68 - 1557.96] before bedtime was another question you
[1555.20 - 1559.88] just asked me it depends if if you've
[1557.96 - 1562.44] been well hydrating throughout the day
[1559.88 - 1565.12] great maybe an hour before bedtime you
[1562.44 - 1567.92] stop your fluid intake you don't want to
[1565.12 - 1569.48] wake up thirsty and then drink water
[1567.92 - 1571.68] another reason why people shouldn't be
[1569.48 - 1573.04] drinking a lot of alcohol or smoking
[1571.68 - 1574.40] weed because it makes you thirsty you're
[1573.04 - 1576.16] going to wake up it's going to disrupt
[1574.40 - 1578.20] your sleep now if you look at sleep
[1576.16 - 1580.68] hygiene guidelines printed out on the
[1578.20 - 1583.48] internet they might say no meal 3 hours
[1580.68 - 1586.40] before bedtime no fluids 3 hours before
[1583.48 - 1588.24] bedtime not necessarily one size does
[1586.40 - 1590.88] not fit all right it's a personalized
[1588.24 - 1594.52] approach so what kind of food are you
[1590.88 - 1596.92] consuming before bed I would say the
[1594.52 - 1599.08] reason they say 3 hours before bedtime
[1596.92 - 1601.00] no food is because sometimes there's
[1599.08 - 1604.76] reflux and the food can come up and then
[1601.00 - 1606.92] you might feel nauseous and and wake up
[1604.76 - 1609.60] however if you're eating healthy foods
[1606.92 - 1610.96] before night time so when what's he
[1609.60 - 1614.04] healthy you know this better than
[1610.96 - 1616.36] anybody else high protein complex slow
[1614.04 - 1618.68] carbs they maintain your energy blood
[1616.36 - 1621.20] sugar levels and a steady state
[1618.68 - 1624.00] throughout the night if you have fast
[1621.20 - 1626.04] carbs sugars all that junk food that we
[1624.00 - 1628.16] mentioned earlier it's going to burn out
[1626.04 - 1630.28] of your system very quickly you might
[1628.16 - 1632.40] have a dip in your blood sugar levels in
[1630.28 - 1634.12] the middle of the night middle of the
[1632.40 - 1636.32] night you have more dream sleep you burn
[1634.12 - 1637.64] as many calories as when you're awake so
[1636.32 - 1640.16] what's it going to do it's going to say
[1637.64 - 1641.36] wait a minute low blood sugar let me get
[1640.16 - 1643.40] some more where am I going to get it
[1641.36 - 1645.20] from wake up I'm going to get it from my
[1643.40 - 1648.40] cortisol because it pulls the muscle
[1645.20 - 1649.76] glycogen to convert it to glucose
[1648.40 - 1651.36] and then it's going to wake you up
[1649.76 - 1653.08] because cortisol is a stress hormone
[1651.36 - 1656.56] it's you're actually going to fuel the
[1653.08 - 1658.28] cortisol Peak earlier and higher in the
[1656.56 - 1660.16] middle of the night than it would
[1658.28 - 1662.28] otherwise the normal cortisol Peak is
[1660.16 - 1664.80] between 4: and 600 in the morning it
[1662.28 - 1667.88] slowly Rises you as your melatonin drops
[1664.80 - 1669.76] you'll be sabotaging your sleep wow
