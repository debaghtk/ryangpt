Transcript: you said that you know you were never an athlete and now you've conquered one of the most grueling races in the world the marathon Des sabla it is one of the world's hottest and most grueling endurance races why is it the most grueling race on the planet it is a lot for a person to deal with I like to call MDS is like the bare minimum race but coming down like this like big drop was scary so they Tire rope and you have to hold the rope and then you go down now imagine you're going down you have walking sticks you have a bag on you and then you have the mat of of on which you sleep which is to the bag so you're standing and there is like a steep it's a drop as I'm scared I'm trying to drag my feet in through the sand and the next thing I know I hit my leg on a big boulder inside MDS did have history of uh someone dying many years ago I think the toughest part of the marathon disabl preparation was the food mahash Goos one of the first Indian women to conquer the marathon day sabul with more than 50 races completed she is not only a successful Runner but also a corporate leader inspiring thousands of Indians with a remarkable ability to balance Both Worlds why did you become a marathon runner so sha thank you for coming on my podcast it's a pleasure to have you today over here everyone knows you as a runner but let's start at the beginning were you always a runner did you did you have this thing that you were running marathons in school what's your story so Ryan thank you so much it's an absolute pleasure and Delight to be here and part of your podcast never thought I'm going to be here 5 years ago but something I did that got me here super happy uh to going back on how my life was I forget running I I never ever was even into sports I'm born to a traditional Bengali family where Focus was in education music painting uh the only complaint my parents ever got from school was I was never into any kind of sport so that's my background and uh I I think I continued being that person till I became so fat and I just didn't know what to do and then I took to Fitness as a as a rescue mission to get rid of it and you know those numbers I were 78 kgs in early 2000 pretty much in Bangalore studying in college and uh I remember that at one point I was not able to fit into any clothes that I had and every month I would have to go and buy new clothes and I to ask my dad this was the engineer you yes this was the engineer me and you're just out of college and I was in was in early 20s I was still in college and I was in early 20s and uh I had to just ask my dad for extra money every month because I had to go and buy newer clothes and of course with that I was also being very sick I got PCOS and pcod whatever and uh you know gastric issues in and out of the doctor all the time and at some point I think I just had this moment of breakdown meltdown as you would call it in today's terminology I said I cannot live like this my confidence was Rock Bottom uh I think if in today's situation you would evaluate it I was borderline a case of depression because I was so fat I only used to wear a certain kind of clothes because I didn't know what to wear and uh I think that was the turning point when I first started into a weight loss regime and the only Fitness activity I could get to doing was walking so I walked and in 3 months of course I I did try to work on my nutrition and my food habit rather of course then it was called dieting and there was no concept of nutrition so I got into the traditional dieting model and I lost weight and then I joined a gym and then I was I continued that Journey because I didn't want to go back to being 78 kg so I was into gym and I decently managed to do my dieting borderline and you reached what about 6 and I reached about 64 65 kgs and I sustained that till 2012 when I actually someone literally borderline he the dearest friend coass me to get into running saying that oh you're strong because you do gym and you should start running so that's my background so why did you become a marathon runner I mean like you said somebody coerced you to become a runner what what's your story on that he like the Nasha hit you on day one or it took a few months to get there it's uh it's funnier that I I used to work in vipro and then vipro used to have this run called uh the spirit of vipro run and also you used to work for Vio I used to work and they that time and they have a run they still have it it's one of the I think it's in the Guinness record or something saying that all locations within 24 hours some country is doing that run worldwide and so that's their USP and that was the run I registered for and the first ever time just signed up straight up for 21.1k then I called his friend I said okay now that you've got you signed up for 21.1 and you were only walking and jyming I had only done jyming and I by borderline hated running if I may say I thought it's extr ex boring and the only running I would do is like those 20 minutes before my gym training on the treadmill which I really really would find an excuse into like you know not to do it absolutely had no I said okay you know and uh the funnier part is that his wife was my then boss so I said well you know what one time I'll just do this and get rid of it and then never again in my life and then I called him and I said okay now I've signed up tell me how to train and I broadly had like 3 months so he told okay 2 days you continue running on the gym and one day you go out and run in some wherever I was staying and that's how I did and then I I went to the race day I had no experience of what it means you don't know hydration nutrition nothing and I was I thought I'm going to be the last person everybody would have left by the time I came I came back and then somebody came running and said Madam Madam uh runner up I said what runner up I mean I would have come last everybody would have left so the my first ever half I did was in 215 which is by the number game isn't a decent is is a pretty good number even today so that was like my first trigger saying oh you know what this isn't bad I can try you got the N I got the Ki saying and so I I was the second runner up so I was like okay maybe next year I can be I can either come first or be the second runner up and then so I continued doing that only with that goal that okay next year I'm going to like so I suddenly found myself putting up into a goal to do it I think that just kicked in saying I in the very first race I I enjoyed the flavor of what it does you get a medal it's like you know somebody told very interestingly that this is One race where you don't have to win to get a medal it's like instant gratification never thought of it like that I have a wall full of medals you've seen it so I thought that was that was rather amazing to start with and and then the rest is history so you know Marathon half marathon runers up position a full marathon is what distance 42 42.2 point2 that's a that's a long distance okay but even driving a car that distance like like we live in the city of Bangalore okay and you're visiting me today and average speed in bangal is 15 km/ hour so if I sit in a car I'm actually taking almost 3 hours to reach there and you would actually run faster than that in in most Marathon bases so people are Now setting themselves up to do 5K 10K uh 22 21 which is the half and the full Marathon what has been your most let me ask me this how many marathons have you run so far approximately would you have cost 100 marathons by now yeah if I add all distances across yes but if I say only the full distance which the 42.2 I I just did my 18th in uh Mumbai wonderful and in all of these all of them whether whatever irres to the distance which has been your most memorable Marathon or or most memorable run I think Jerusalem Marathon stay is my most memorable Marathon ever why so for for many reasons is that the distance is same for most marathons right of course of course so is that it's my first International Marathon okay and uh how did you land in Jerusalem of all places very funny most people do London or Boston or Chicago I mean you have to qualify to get it so what was the logic I think I think I have I have a really bad set of friends so this another I hope they're not listening to this podcast I hope they're listening to this because so this friend of mine said oh we should do Jerusalem because Jerusalem is known as the highest marathon in the in the in the Marathon distance worldwide because it's extreme high elevations because of the terrain that it is and it and makes you run through the city so this friend said oh we should do my Jerusalem I'm going to do Jerusalem marathon and this and that I said well okay you know let me also sign up and I'm very diligent when I say something then I say something it's not like I'm going to I don't I just don't say it for the heck of it so I said and next thing I know I've registered and then I've applied for visa and I have visa and everything and then I called and I said have you signed up he's like oh no I'm still thinking I'm like excuse me so the friend is convinced every want to go to Jerusalem has not signed up yeah he's not signed up but you have already got your tickets I got my tickets everything is said I am going I said okay then I'm going so you know friend sign up no okay so so the find that friend and shoot him yeah I mean I really I was like I will never forgive you for like so I went to Jerusalem all by myself you know and uh and I did this run now why it is why it is uh my favorite is that there's the first time in an Airbnb I actually stayed with the Jewish family and I still have such fond memories of that place where I stayed second interesting thing Jerusalem shuts down the city on the day of the race and then shuts down literally like because you cannot get taxi nothing and I was staying obviously in an Airbnb which is in a residential area and I had to go to this park where the Run starts so and I had booked pre-booked a taxi so the taxi said yeah yeah we're going to come and all of that called him in early morning getting ready ready to leave waiting to come yeah yeah coming coming coming I'm going and waiting down and I never carry my phone and I'm all alone so where am I going to leave my bag and phone and all that so no phone I go then after he's not come he's not come he's not com I'm like my heart rate is really racing already and then at some point he says no the city is closed I can't come and I oh shcks it's like 7 km from where I'm staying is the start line do a pre-warm up run of 7 kilome yes so so then I said okay whatever I saw the map and I said okay this is broadly in which direction I have to go rest I'm going to ask whoever is on the way to the start point I will reach 7 km. I have enough time I will run to the start Line run to the start line that's the start of my first International Marathon so I went I started running then I saw some cops I I pleaded their cops saying can you please drop me to the start line the cops called their boss and said can we drop this l she has a bab and she's going for the race so they declined so there was this taxi guy who had who was canning some I don't know some six seven people he charged he said I will take 2x money but I will take you to the start location however up to me I said dude you take $100 I don't care save me 7K running before the run so it was so sweet that actually that guy took me to the start line I reached on time and I did the run the Run was beautiful it takes you through the whole city cobone to like cobblestone elev like was the first time I saw like you don't see this this the first International right so you don't see like you're here and then 500 M you see like everybody's going up straight like that it's that high elevation and then you're going steep down it was insane I had I think I aimed to do like a 450 you know something I was still not as fast as I am now but then I ended up doing a 445 because I was like that slow and the terrain and people were zipping past obviously the locals who live and train in there for them it was like a cakewalk but I and the prettiest City I could run and you can see the entire city running through the route so I Jerusalem by far stays my favorite ever whever I've run I think I haven't had another one which will take away that experience so many people may know this uh out there that I am her nutritionist and my favorite run with her is the marathon the sapla the MDS so you know um I thought you would have said that is your favorite run but I I also remember it was your most grueling Testament to the metal grit that any individual on the planet has so tell me and tell my fans about the MDS first of all why is it the most grueling race on the planet and when I say grueling it can kill you yeah MDS did have history of uh someone dying many years ago but uh and so the distance is so so I think what makes MDS tough is uh I split it into three parts and the first part is of course the fact that the terrain it's in the Sahara Desert uh and so you're running a distance in the Sahara Desert yeah and when we say desert in India if you go to say jessl and see India I've done in pokran and that terrain is tough but I had not seen what a desert really is just to give you a context and I'll give you a very uh something that people probably would have done is when you go to Dubai and you do the Dune bashing you know how those Dune bashings are right so imagine 2x of that Dune sizes is what MDS has that's only the dunes then there are these Rocky terrains which has those Pokey rocks because of the sand abration the the rocks are very very sharp so they have this little narrow patch through which you have to run some parts they actually you have to climb holding a rope uh and then of course those Dunes are miles and miles and miles long and that heat so so now everyone's thinking this is a one day race yeah so so that is number one is the terrain the second is the distance and the way the distance is planned now it is a 250 I my it so the distance is distance varies between in the range of 250 because it 250 km 250 km it cannot be the same distance because since they are you work you're in the desert like you know you you that it kind of varies by 2 3 4 km sit in a car and drive 250 km I crib I just cannot imagine how somebody will decide to run 250 kmet that too in the Sahara Desert yeah so and and it is done through six stages now it's not like you you know today I don't feel like running so I will do 20 and tomorrow I will do 100 today if I'm scheduled to do 42 or 38 or 31 then I have to do that and I have to finish within the cut off time for me to qualify to do the next day so every day is a race against yourself yes and to qualify every day is a race for you to qualify for the next day so it can be that with all this preparation you know in my epis season some there were people who actually didn't make it to the last day like they were disqualified the day they were getting the medal can you imagine how hurtful that would be like they've gone through the entire 256 km torture yes but they still didn't make it on the Finish Line I don't think I can deal with that pain like you know so that is why MDS has this it is it is unique and surprising in terms of giving you pain at all different levels okay now the third part is it is you know it is self-supported which means that you carry everything that you need for the race during the race your hydration nutrition your lunch your dinner your sleeping accessories your uh race gear everything on you and you carry that bag and you run on your by yourself so you're in the desert you got to do it over five or 6 days six 6 days you've got 250 kilm D in sand and to top it off you're carrying everything that you own through this desert over 6 days and now they tell you to carry your food and water also with you yes they only give you water which is also at the temperature whatever it can sustain so there's no concept of cold water as marathoners we are very we luxurious Runners we get chilled water ice and uh cold sponge and food and all of that you get nothing all you get is water which is which which we ideally got lukewarm water so I drank lukewarm water through the race and when I got really really bugged and I wanted to have something cold I would take that water when I was back in the tent and then I would wrap up my uh buff with water and then cover it and let it be after maybe one two year hours that water will cool down to become like in drinkable temperature or something like that now uh the food is critical because you have there's a mandate as well by the way there are no kitchens in the Sahara Desert if anyone's thinking there is you have to light your own fire you have to light you have to carry your own fire I remember carry your own stuff and you have to light your own fire now uh just to give people perspective that that tent that I'm talking about is actually like a tarpine which is which is in an inverted V shape tucked with logs at the back and it's open on both sides there's no cover and you you carry that no that that tent is what they carry and they set it up for us so the tents are laid out by numbers like our rooms we are allocated those tents and all of we have to stay in those tents each tend to shared by eight people we have like a thick carpet at the bottom which is like a du nothing better than that and a similar thing on the top the sand come to the tent so that's what I'm saying and in both sides it's open and every evening we had Sandstorm and every evening everything we had was in sand so you had sand in every cice of your body yes and we had sand like it by you can't have a bath okay there is yeah so yeah so 12 lit water they give you every day day so you get only 12 L of water and that water is for you to brush poop do whatever 12 lit is all you get for your cooking for your race for your hydration for your hydration for your whatever you need to do you can get additional water at an expense of time so like if you take say it's like a video game yeah yeah so if it's like you take extra bottle of water saying okay I want like they give you two 1.5 L bottles and then the big five can when you come back to the camp so if you take extra water take first time you ask 30 30 minute add it to your time now people are struggling here to finish like you know 10 hours you make it to like 9:55 imagine what it'll do to add 30 minute to you first time 30 minute second time 1 hour I think if you ask third time then you're disqualified so it's not like you can uh borrow the other strict rule is that you cannot borrow from anybody if you are caught borrowing then you will be pulled out of the race the the runner who had been having the first position through last 10 years was actually given penalty because he was caught taking something from somebody so it's only water it's food also it's everything okay like if you're sitting in the camp and you're like sharing and all of that is okay but if you're taking anything borrowing like you know extra water or extra food so the race is you have to carry what you consume and if you don't carry what what you are meant to consume deal with it yes if you you cannot even trash it's it's an eco-friendly race you cannot even trash outside of where you're sitting so like the bottles they give you carry a bib number oh so so you have to be really climate conscious about what you're doing yes so you suppose I know about this so when you go to the when you go to the checkpoint for example they're going to give you your bottle so so our dehydrated food sachets and MTR sashes and all all had to be disposed Very Yes wherever so that you eting say in the camp right so you they have uh every tent has like a bin that you put in stuff the important part is water because water they give you through the race points like because you're filling your water at the checkpoint to the checkpoint they give you either two bottles or 1.5 so which you can refill like for example I was carrying the bag and I had 1.5 L bottles on me total 750 750 one had the coction that you gave me which I will talk about and the other one was plain water now that remaining water bottle if you choose to carry with yourself then you have to carry back to the next checkpoint or you leave it at the checkpoint that you are because you cannot trash it on the way if anybody finds out and they're really really strict and you'll have people U you know guarding you all through if they find out the bottle it has your bib number you'll be given penalty to the extent that you may be pulled out of the race wow so so you cannot do that the other interesting part somebody and everybody ask me saying what do you do for toilet and I I have the scene that MDS makes you clean your own it literally does they your poop bags like you have for dogs yeah so they you take your poop bags you go to oh it's not like in India you can just do it and leave yeah it's not like you can go do it and this is the Sara desert where there's nobody there yes so you could bury your basically yeah but but they don't allow you to bury your you cannot do that you have you have those enclosures kind of made and which H which has like a western uh you know style uh infrastructure you put the poop bag there you use it lift it pick it up tie it up and there's a bin there which you very go through now you can and if you have to say on the go road while you're running if you have to use outside the checkpoint that's probably exceptions where but how many of you doing but if you're at the camp you cannot just go and litter anywhere so there's no concept of littering they do have an extremely good care of medical facility now of all of these the third point of why MDS is difficult is because through that race uh that that whole experience of phys physical pain added to it the mental preparation I think it needs a next level of mental great determination to be doing that kind of race because you obviously not eating the food that you like you're not eating you know if you're feeling cold and hot and sunny you typically want to have hot cold water or cold drink or open the fridge and have something you don't even get the kind of food that you used to eating like I ate uh you know what I not even Frozen f like that halam Dal chavel for forever now even if I look in the flight and I'm like oh my God how did I eat this for 7 days so I think sum of putting all of this together it is a lot for a person to deal with it just kind of takes you to the bare minimum I like to call MDS is like the bare minimum race you only have as much as you need like my mom asked me a very interesting question before I was leaving she said so what if you like you need something and you don't have it I said that's the whole point that you know you may need something but you don't have it so how do you survive in such situations I think it's a race of survival as against the way we kind of deal with all our other runs so for me it was very exciting when you came up to me and said Ryan I'm going to do the MDS and I was like oh oh because it's it's I feel it's every nutritionist worst nightmare because planning a planning a diet plan for marathon runners you know different races across the world Ultra marathons and all it's pretty easy because you go to a place you stop you can get whatever you want the cold water the Biryani you know you can eat what you want the gels and all and in this race everything is boiling down to that 13 kgs that you could carry yeah I think my bag was 11.5 but minimum minimum eight and I think maximum you could do was four 14 yeah but you know when we were planning the whole thing I still remember we were snipping off sashes so they could become lighter and then I'm not going to carry this I'm not going to carry this I'll just eat this basic so then we decided to plan psychological warfare also if you remember we tested out those Foods where you got bored and ate it for a few days too but um give us some insights into what we packed into your bag so I think the toughest part of the marathon Thea's preparation was the food I think I I remember uh this was pretty much the same time last uh 2023 when I think I had this room filled with all kinds of packed food wherever I could find like from fight to uh you know any food store uh I remember uh Sanjay going to some from Food Market he got everything like everybody got everything everything that they could think of and it was my job to kind of eat and reject or accept yeah yeah it was it was really really horrible I remember this one question you asked me is like like Ryan what about the nutritional content of it and I said scha we have already done one MDS the nutritional content for 5 days if you can just eat an idly or Crispies you will still survive because your body will go where you will break down is psychologically and therefore the food could be that one thing that may be giving you that Ray of Hope so so good you bring that up is because I think when you remember I think we we went through that Excel of ours like three four five times the first time we did and we put it up uh first of all tasting that food was the most horrendous experience because as you know I don't like eating packed food and all of that I I'm a big fan of you know cook fresh and eat I don't even like fridge food so for me to put like hot water into some halam daba and Dal chaan and I was like God what is it doing to my body kind of a feeling all thanks to you you make me feel like that but I think so that was the toughest part and then then when we uh built that list I think and when we started packing we realized that the weight was like insane there's no way we could carry that and then the amount of gel and bar and all of that and I think that's when we started R rationing saying okay you know one that was the equation that you and I had which is I went to the max of your weight yeah because the logic was okay she can carry this much she can eat this much normally let's give it to her but I think where you came back to me was I'm going in as a soldier uh and I think I can if you're giving me 100% you I I actually remember you seeing that you could even survive at 40% correct I I think I when I was training with that bag I remember I was training like I trained with my bag for like about 7 8 kgs and I said okay this is this is manageable you know this is manageable in Goro in a in a flat Road in in and and I'm doing it like one time I think you started panicking when the bag went beyond 10 KS yes I I really really freaked out and I think that's when I said okay you know like remove remove remove remove what is it that is bare minimum we also went to the extent of even taking the readymade food where the foil packing was 250 g and we found out a foil packing that was half that weight I removed the packings except anything that was was like this Nitro packing except that I think I got those small packs of everything and anything I could bring out even the bars I took the lightest weight of the bars I got most of the stuff from wherever I could to to to do that but what was interesting is that I did keep things that as you say that gave a psychological boost you know like if you remember the pickle you suggested I carry yeah imagine I remember pickle in MDS because my thought process desert but an Indian wants a pickle no and eating that gel and those bars after a while my only like one two day three was okay the day after I finished the long run day and I do want to talk about how that rer as that one was you know your taste parts are completely dead like the the the look of the gel and you want to puke so all you want to do is what do you do and pickle was such a Saving Grace I know that when I do next time I'm going to cut short one more jelly carry an extra pickle because that was the Survivor so I think like you know uh the pickle those little little things I remember I carried a packet of little hearts As a treat to me because you really like little hearts the the the potato chips that I carried you know I think some of those things to to ensure that I am getting a little bit of that food pleasure if you may say was was absolutely helpful the hajola that I carry do you remember when I came when you came back and I met you for the first time I I actually gifted her packets of chips because I realized you know as a nutritionist there's physiology and there's psychology and people might think hey this nutritionist is giving L chips to her client and it's it's about the psychology it was not about the physiology of nutrition it it was it was the most thrilling experience that Ryan walks into my house with this whole bag and it opens and gives say you know chips and I said and this I have to take a picture because I earned this chips packet by running it MDS I think so it was but those those are the Hilarious Moments you know that you had but um you know there were I remember when you came back you said there were moments that you wanted to just quit up and give and you you hit rock bottom you hit soul searching you short of seeing God I think that race really put a gun to your head so what were the most difficult parts of the race you remember which day what moment so the most difficult part of the race for me was the long distance the 90 kilm day that was I think if I'm not mistaken day three it's the day four and the five day four and five day four and five and after that also you have a 42k du after you finish the 90k so it's literally running a marathon every day in the desert and one of the days was a dual Marathon yes and the 90k day I had one simple logic of that I will finish I'll start and I'll finish and then I will stop which I think the smartest thing I did uh but also that that day was really really hard in terms of the root like my you know it's like psychologically how you console yourself saying oh this is a long day so while it's a longest I'm sure the route is going to be the easiest so the first half of the of the race was horrible like it was so so craz tough and I remember this one tough from a point of view the heat the sand the those are those are constant that that is always they are they are the top markers always what varies is also the root now this had this one root which was like this uh bar in dry land and the bar in dry land is very hard it's very very tough to kind of walk or run in those terrains then it had this long patch of I don't know maybe 8 10 kilm and I have some pictures of that was it was so so Rocky that there's no way you could even maneuver your legs properly I remember one of my clients actually in his first MDS pulled out because he strained his ankle on this so you actually can't go fast right yes and so what happens especially when you reach the top of the Dune which you don't realize so sometimes so this one this the on this day you go through this really really extremely Rocky like big boulders where you have to like literally it's like trekking imagine if you're hiking up a mountain how does so it's pretty much like that and then and everyone sees Sahara just flat sand right no correct that's what so so so the dunes are like at least three floor four floor High Dunes which you climb and then you come down and then there are these patches where you have this you going through this kind of gradual you can't go around the Dune then the 250 km will become 500 km of course you can so there are there are flag markers along the way yeah there are flag markers along the way so you can see the flag marker yeah you can see the flag marker and do you see that Mirage effect of course and you see the flag marker looks like oh it is right there like 50 m it's actually like probably 2 km away because it's it's and that's what plays mind games with you right that's what play so I'll tell you the night story of course and uh so so this one time I reach up the top of the Dune and I can't see anything below and I'm like what happened so you're standing and there is like a steep drop it's a drop and is the sun like really really so this probably is like 300 p.m. in the afternoon 2 3 p.m. in the afterno sun goggles at all time right Sun goggles all the time you can only take it out once the sun is off and then also you don't want to because the sand dunes coming up so you better just wear something so and you use any special lenses no I just used Oakley uh prism uh standards nothing else okay and uh and so then and so that's one thing I didn't advise you about which sunglasses to use in the yeah so I just I just Googled up and I saw whatever everybody was was airing so I just picked up that so that is maybe the next MDS if you decide to do it we we'll Google up how does it's going to come come to your list very soon ra Ryan so so you were talking about this drop right yes and and so and so that drop so when you talk about the people getting hurt is is one such example where actually uh a lot of people who are used to that kind of going down and elevations and all that they were like zipping past I'm petrified of coming down I'm I'm always happy to climb but coming down like this like big drop was scary so they tie a rope and you have to hold the rope and then you go down now imagine you're going down you have walking sticks you have a bag on you and then you have the mat of of on which you sleep which is to the bag so you are you have something really bulky on your back so it obstructs your movement it's not like a free movement and then you have your walking sticks on you and you come down they come down a little bit and then there's no rope so then you have to go down on your own now as I'm scared I'm trying to drag my feet in through the sand and the next thing I know I hit my leg on a big boulder inside ouch and it was like okay so my right foot was full of blisters thankfully the left foot didn't get any blisters I don't know why this disparity but then to help that the left foot now had this big thud on some some Boulder Aisha please note this down okay that she got blisters on the right foot so for the next MDS we do uh weight load of the bag should be uh to the left and also maybe your gate analysis is more pressure on the right so that is correct we never got this in the um end counseling this is a point that I got in today wow awesome so okay so you got the the hurt so I got the hurt now the the the obviously my mind went saying oh gosh right is already in and psychologically psychologically I'm like I'm like oh my God what did what happened and it was kind of hurting hurting hurting so anyway so that was in into the 50 km this this is probably the 40th 50th kilometer but anyway so and you still had about 40 km more to go I still have 50 km to go because it was 90 km day so anyways I calm down and then whatever I finished we went and then the Sun starts to go down and the route is a little bit nice how do you walk in the night so at night you just walk or you run because have a head lamp or something you have a head lamp and so my my were you walking with other people just to keep yourself motivated no I wasn't because uh because you I mean you might randomly just talk to somebody or something because I was all by myself right so it's it's not uh how safe is a marathon for women it's it's safe there are a lot of people running alone I ran most of the for our viewers because there are only people from the MDS is there public around there no there's nothing nobody it's in the Sahara Desert like for God's sake there's not even animals or there's there's nothing out there you see any animal no we only saw in some plats when we were crossing maybe like some so-called distant Village which is like three four houses you will probably see another human being or you will see some camels there's nothing else like there is nothing else there is no tree no plant one of the lonliest races yes it is it is it is so that's why I said that mind is very very important like I played all kind of games with myself I kind of I played anakar I uh I did conversations with people all my life you know like I I I had moments where I just went back from my life from where I remember till date you know how my life has been what I did almost like a um internal meditation yes it is it is it is meditative like when you when I came back I think I was I was a different person because I had like uh Aloha moments of saying oh you know what what a discovery I found you much more Cala in your subsequent counselings that I did like previously to the MDS you would be very agitated before a race yeah any marathon I got to get this I got to get that I got to do this you know like you're catching a bus to somewhere and now you're like if I miss the bus I'll walk correct so I see it it just brings things to perspective as I said that you know there was no luxury of say changing clothes I wear the same set of clothes for 7 days so today what about women if they have their mental cycle in the desert you figure it out and we planned for it right yeah you you figure it out I'm I'm sure there were 120 people women so I'm sure people had those challenges or whatever I mean you figured it out so in athletic poest what we do is we understand women's cycle 12 months in advance that's why for any marathon Ultra Runner or Olympic level athlete if you track your menstruation cycle on an app then you can use food or certain nutriceutical about one year in advance to slightly shift your menstruation cycle because if you know the MDS is on X date around 6 to 7 months prior you can plan to shift it slightly so that was one thing that we were you know working with you but um you know you carried all of these things and all um Everybody carried water and I remember telling you we need to get you the best isotonic solution which I know as a sports nutritionist is glucose fructose and the right ratio of sodium to potassium because you in the desert or anywhere for that matter you you lose five times the amount of sodium to potassium and in more sporting events of marathons you lose it only for one day and here was 5 days on the Trot but I think I was very uh I was very enamored or very startled at the same time to discover that many people just relied on Plain water so what was your experience with hydration what was your experience with the one Chase and how did it help you out um at the Sahara MDS I still remember the taste of that decoction I used to make in the morning when I used to leave the camp like by the day sixth I was like cursing you saying Ryan I cannot have this another day of my life but you didn't CR but that was the reason I think I was able to sustain through those seven days in this brutal he is because I had my hydration in place when I say hydration is not just about water it was Al it was about the electrolytes I was getting I had the right portion and the right mix of whatever I needed to sustain because you're losing salt at such a fast pace could you see the white salts on your outfit everything was white everybody everything was white the other the other Runners also yes everything was white you could you could feel it by the time you would come back and your body is so heated because of of uh you know like you're wearing Gator so your foot is kind of really boiling ins G just for the general audience in India who's never seen a desert what are gators so Gators are like shoe covers like imagine a socks that you wear over a shoe it it is kind of uh stuck to your shoe with a velcro uh it prevents for any sand to go inside but did sand go in no but you have to wear a gator to run in a in a sand you get snow Gators as well which protects you from it getting wet and not snow not getting into your uh shoes and socks so you have to wear a sand Gator the job of it is that sand doesn't go inside your foat now the challenge with gators is that it becomes your it's like heat sealed inside so that is why you get blisters and hot what was what was the peak temperature during the day around 4850 4850 we would start at like 40 this year so uh I think anyone doing the MDS this year is going to be uh crucial because it's going to be the hottest summer on the planet yeah it it it was it was a it was the H shoes melt in any way no it didn't because uh thanks to my shoes but I did have a teammate who Sho did you use for the I wore Solomon I've always done all my Trails uh with Solomon I am a big I I believe they are the best and you know when we talking about one Chase being the the uh I I remember you sending me a picture of one Chase in the desert yes and I was like I was so proud because being the creator of isotonic solution like what would you ask you wanted to enhance performance in people but then when you put that in the Sahara desert in the sand you know it just gives you a perspective 5 days in the desert isotonic but you shared one story that a lot of people did cramp and were were were lost on Race because they had no knowledge about how to hydrate so I will tell you a simple example and I was surprised because we assume that the Western people are far more educated than us here in India and you said that many came with just absolutely nothing so one of my tent mates the day one uh when we finished we were like the day one we were like close by we thought okay we'll run together I was new I was a little skeptical so we started with them and then of course I I moved ahead and then uh they they came a little later and when we kind of pretty much finished nearby he came and he fainted at the finish line that was day one fainted hasn't collapsed yeah okay at like at the camp on day one now he's he is a he's a tri athlete he's done one of uh the hardest full Iron Mans in the world he has done like I don't know some 100 days solo sailing and stuff like that so he does this like the back of his hand but of course he's from UK and he's not used to this kind of heat he was not prepared you're more tropical he did he didn't have he was not taking any electrolytes and he was just like that I'm genuinely surprised because Triathlon Iron Man you know you got to be educated that Sports Nutrition nutrition is so important because because Ryan nobody's nobody wants to spend on nutrition speak speaking of spending how much are you spend for the MDS what's the what's the entry fee to enter the MDS today uh 4500 pound to register wow that's a lot of money and then the gear that you have to place in place adds up to I don't know I mean maybe about uh $22,000 so you're spending about 10,000 I spent about approximately 7 to 8 lakhs just the race I'm not considering my training my nutrition all of that I'm keeping aside because that's my regular expense for example so for the Indian audience out there if you to prepare for the MDS you're looking at about a 15 lakh expenditure and I mean if they go through nutrition the training the phys the running coach yes anywhere between 10 to 12 lakhs for sure if you want to be like supercharged Mercedes-Benz side you you go a little bit higher on your expenditure yeah because because see some of those things like so this is not something a student can do well if the father's Rich he or she can or or they get good sponsors were you sponsored no nobody nobody's sponsored we are open for sponsorship for the next MDS you give us the money we're going to the Sahara I I'll be the guy that sits in the Moroccan hotel watching TV and like okay where is she at this point in the race yeah they have they have a GPS tracker so you can actually track me where I am were you were were people in the MDS allowed to contact their families you had there is no network talk to me about no phones what about that there's no phone there's phone there's no phone there's no network there's no charging option you carry your either charger uh like a power bank car you carried a power bank right I carried a power bank I don't know why I carried it so next time I'm not going to carry phone I can just shave off like at least 500 G by not carrying those right I know phone I can shave off 500 G to you and me like what is 500 G when you have to go 5 days through the desert Ryan you're saying that you remember the toothbrush I cut off the tail of the toothbrush because it saved me 10 G like you telling me you you know what we did Afters we found the baby tooth brush which you put on your thumb and you that's what you told me but I said you know what in the sand it might get lost and I won't have one then then now then I actually thought I said why do I even need a toothbrush it's not like I'm having shower and I'm you know jelling my hair and coming out like this I'm like you're in sand and dust so I said next time I told I said I don't even need a toothbrush you know I'm going to carry and I carried that tiny two piece paste uh but I do have a list of things that I'm not going to carry next year do you have photographs of that I I mean I'm sure I have yeah let's put these photographs up in the podcast so people can see these it was insane the kind of stuff I uh I did but carried but there is an option of uh using satellite phone which is at an additional cost to call uh home and I did call I think after uh the long day after the third day I think and okay the the the most amazing or The Lovable part of MDS okay uh you you go you day one you finish and then this lady so there are dedicated people who take care of tents like you know like tent managers so to say so they come any announcement anything they have to give and all of that they come and give 10 by 10 by 10 because there is no like big mic and all of that happening so this lady comes in the evening with a bunch of paper printouts and they call out and they give those papers now take a wild guess what those papers are emails from home yes they have letters from friends and family who have sent emails to us on day one what was very interesting nobody sent me email the LA the previous year my bib number 917 that person sent me an email saying I was 917 you're doing very well you know that person was tracking meow and and complete stranger who's never met I don't know who that person is he was 917 the previous year so today this year I I know the two word is 917 I'm going to send that person an email so only an MDS veteran knows what it is to be broken and do that race and what that the words of encouragement mean for the next person and then and so that when you know now from the day next day onwards everybody would like we would all wait and I had whole bunch of people like my my boss my physio you everybody sent emails for the next six seven days and we remember we used to read out those emails and we literally used to cry why why would you read out the emails everyone in the tent would listen in yeah yeah we would share like we would share comments like some some people had their kids writing in and they would have funny jokes or you know somebody had I would jump and say oh you know what my boss sent me an email like for God's sake when I'm off work she should be cursing me and she was there cheering and supporting for me that's something that you would want to share so we would share and we would cry and you know it was it was like those the the tent becomes your family you share those moments which are so special does it give you does it give you hope that humans can connect anywhere in the world oh yes especially if you're put in a situation like this in a state of Crisis and survival I think you become the best of the friends I I mean uh I'm going to London now so I'm really looking forward to meeting all of them and and there are people who you Bor really well with and uh I met one of them at Berlin last year in September so I especially if you're put into this kind of distress situation you know it happens in a lot in professional lives also if you have a bad boss then the team really really bonds very well because the pain point is the same we all relate to ourselves we were at MDS the same situation we were all away from home we were not in touch we were we were we were getting going through putting ourselves to this whole pain or whatever so we obviously had each other to kind of share and nobody understood our pain better than the people who were there themselves like you know I I had the most amazing experience like there was this there was my neighbor and somehow he was like the fir man he would lit the fire and I was never successful in lighting that fire to heat the water so okay so you needed the fire for warming heting the water is what you will put in your food then that food will become edible right otherwise this is all that dried stuff that we were carrying so and and then of course I needed my coffee in the morning so it was his job he would wake him say do you want some hot water sh in his English and I would say oh yes of course why not and then he would make that so how do you heat the water you would have butane torch or paraffin candles we had these uh little and one tiny little stuff which which weighed I think some 20 gam or something and then it had those uh tablets which you which you pre-order and you carry at the camp because you can't carry in the flight and then uh they lit up you light them and then there's fire it takes a lot of while because it's open it's windy there is Sandstorm putting bags so you're trying to put uh like yeah like there's one time I think two twice actually there's like a big fire lit up in front of some tent so we were we were at the outside so it was easier for it was easier for us that nothing would go on to fire but it's very difficult to light one because there was like open air coming up how many people took part in the MDS 1200 this year and we had 40% almost 40% drop out 1,200 people take part in the most grueling race on the planet and 40% drop out so this year they don't drop out they they don't beat the cut right no the people do drop out because uh anyone drop out from your tent yes day two what was the reason day two he dropped out and he he uh he just injury or just I can't do it I can't do it I can't do it because it's a see it's all the Indians all the Indians are asking do we get a refund on the funny you're you're you're you're like you're like it's it's it's like once paid it's it's like marriage once done you can't be not married again all the business Community when you enter the MDS remember no refund so you have to complete the MDS yeah yeah it's it's like after spending all of that money you spend the same money whether you finish or you not finished so you better decide what you want to do it speaking of spending money you know I want to take a U-turn into what we have been to doing the last few years together you're one of the very few marathon runners in the country who invest in um Sports nutrition plan many people do Sports nutrition plan they do 3 months 6 months 12 months they do it with people like me or Sports nutritionist or at my Kaa nutrition clinic or with the various dietitians nutritionist out there or even the running coaches do nutrition uh plans but people do it like 3 months 6 months and all we've been together now for years I think four years running now or 5 years running what's your thought process as an elite Runner as an endurance Runner as a woman runner on spending money on a nutrition advisory plan I will tell you something that my mom told me and I will remember this moment I was sitting at the Morocco airport to come back home and after the race I was just like I was I was to extend my trip and come back but then I preponed it and I said you know what I'm done I want to just get home and there's always said thing no let's get home yeah it's like I think I had had enough when I was alone lonely like beaten broken uh but yet a new me and I think I just was waiting to come back to the Comfort so my so there were two things that one my dad said and one my mom said my dad never appreciated me doing this and of course splurging all the money that I do uh but he said that you know maybe I should have supported you more more uh and I'm so proud of you I think that weighed to me as much as my MDS medal does but the interesting part that my mother said was that you were able to do this because for all these years the way you've taken care of your body especially with your food is why you were able to sustain these seven days because this your body had been prepared for for years it was not that we started one Mon it's not a project you know the point I'm trying to tell is that people take uh nutrition as a project I will do this and then I will learn and then I will do I don't think I've learned in like we're going to finish four years and start five I don't think I've learned and and there is nothing that I can learn I understand I'm more educated to see you know what to eat what is good for me you've given me that sense but can I do this on my own of course not so I think people treat this you know they want to do it but they do not treat their body with that love and care and I go back to saying that it is it is my definition of self love that I want to ensure that while I'm doing the sport with my age going through this grueling experiences I have to take care of my body at all times and that means that I have to have the right nutrition in place it's not about eras it is about my day-to-day at my age I don't have any diseases considering from the family history I have I can be bragging about about it and I think I'm able to do it only because I have worked with you for all these years so I mean I don't I honestly don't understand why people wouldn't spend on staying healthy and happy I think you know you have defined the perspective that your body is the most expensive real estate it is and you're living in it as a landlord you're not living in it as a tenant which what I sees many marathon runners ultramarathon Runners and even 5K 10K Runners everyone like Oh I'm a tenant in my board you know they'll take some cursory advice off the internet and do it and stuff like that it's like this that you know you're okay to spend whatever lacks of money on the doctor but you don't want to prevent spending that money I'm not saying that I may not need to spend that money but at least I'm giving my body a fair chance to not spend that money so why wouldn't I do it right so so the Wonders that you've got in nutrition uh which which you've continue to sustain you've continue to invest and for everyone out there who keeps picking up the phone like I want to work with celebrity Nutri Ryan Fernando I do not work free with people scha invests her hard-earned money in my nutritional Services where am I going with this point year on year you keep investing you know you're a lady who would carry a Lou Von Gucci bag but from a thought process you'd like I'd buy a better shoe I'd buy a better running outfit I'd get a better diet I'd invest in a running coach I'd invest in a mind coach rather than carry that bag which is materialistic but you see it internally to you so when you are investing what are some of the Wonders that you have seen from nutrition like are there like some nice things that you hate doing like look look how I say this nice things that you hate doing first thing in the morning um what are things that you love from a nutrition perspective and and what are the changes that you have seen in nutrition for example you started following something and what was the outcome of that so so on a lighter note my LV bag wouldn't get me sitting here but my investment has been right so I can there is Ari to my investment as people can see here I'm sitting with celebrity nutritionist Ryan Fernando so I think I did it well and right uh you could probably buy four Louis Von bags with the MDS people people just like oh you have you are with how much is Ryan charge and I'm like that's none of your business well like you know go ask Ryan how much he charges are you interested in training with him then just go you know then they say oh you have a coach who's in the US how much does he charge everything is all about money like you have a coach in the US I have a coach in the US who does my running training I've been with him for as long as a little longer than I've been with you I have a coach who does my uh gym and uh you know the whole Mobility agility Etc I also am a regular with the physio you know it's like because to me recovery is most important uh you know and I think I think it's it's about training performance recovery uh and and my General Wellness so I think all of that then coming to your question I think there's just so many I I just don't know where to start but I think the first thing that you got me gluten-free you know I I have always had Roy being a b I've never been a rice fan I've always right chapati like I remember growing up I used to we didn't have a concept of making Roti at home but I always thought bengalis ate rice yeah I didn't oh you was you're an outli I've been I'm born outlier I think I used to get roties from Neighbors or sometimes even from hotel I've even eaten bread for dinner because I didn't want to eat rice because I've never been fond of rice even today I will I would like a Biryani or a fried rice but like rice is like one once in a while occasional treat is fine I'm not like a rice fan so the first and Ive always had this whole problem of sinus and all of that I think when you got me to gluten and lactose free was the first time I saw today I can differentiate I know that when I eat gluten what happens to me so I you know I think that was the biggest lifechanging advice or correction you got into my life first also I had seen my dad he would always say when I I eat Roy my stomach gets upset now what are the chances that he's actually gluten intolerant or allergic but he doesn't know because nobody nobody did the gene test and figured it out and all of that like so I think that was the first it's a turning point in my life if I would say because I have struggled with sinusitis till I met Ryan Fernando so I think I would I owe you for this big time outside of whatever money I pay you number one number two is that with my age to be year on year working on per performance I don't think would be possible if I wouldn't be working with you you actually sorry to interrupt you you actually did about 140 km last week 146 146 kilm I've not even driven that distance in one week scha has run that distance in one week so that gives you the perspective of the pounding she does to her body and how young she looks and I'm not allowed to reveal her age but she's really young at heart really young in cellular age that's because of the nutrition that she puts into your body so also like that you mentioned 46 km and on average I train two to three hours every day I have a full-time job as well so how do you manage family parents your partner your boss your company because people think that okay like this lady must be running then going off to sleep walk us through your day I never get to run and go to sleep like never but it's like I I I I finish running and then by then My Gym trainer is calling ma'am gym I'm like yeah yeah coming wait yeah like is likea where are you the podcast going to start yeah I'm just finishing my run and coming so she's actually finished her run and then come for the podcast that's how disciplined mahasa is yeah I mean I I just I just think that I manage because I I like you say in MBA you're taught right that if you cannot measure you cannot manage and I think we don't we apply it only to sales numbers I apply to my life life I just see that I have 24 hours I need a good quality 6 hour sleep is good enough for me you know if I'm if I'm and people relate recovery and rest to sleep recovery and rest happens through the day it happens through the damn food that you're eating it happens to your state of mind that you are in it it could even happen to just get up and look outside and take few deep breaths is recovery good enough but people don't see it like that people say oh my God you know I need to sleep 10 hours if I run for two I mean nobody needs to sleep for 10 hours so I'm a big fan of sadguru he's he sleeps for like for 3 4 hours that's where I would love to go to so uh and then I I just I just finish my training I eat what you tell me to eat I it's like so when I eat or I go somewhere I have the saying that what would Ryan react to this and Trust You me that is my first reaction saying Ryan will die if he sees me eating this I cannot eat this so that's my reaction but uh uh but I I just I think it's just easy I only spend I recently did a presentation when I said the winning margin and the winning margin is I split my day hours into how I split it and only 8% of my whole day is what I spend into my passion which is Fitness only 8% only 8% the that's still two hours a day right yeah but it is only 8% you still have 92% of your time to do what you want to do the the point I'm trying to make is that it's not that I have anything extra is that that it's a choice I have made you know instead of going and binging at Netflix for 2 hours I would rather go and do my run you know instead of trying and sitting somewhere and and I do coffee after every single day after my run I do coffee with my friends time right it's my yeah I mean everybody knows that 7:30 she is found at the cafe respective like if I don't go then the coffee guy will ask go Madam like you know it's the cutest thing I hear and then I come back I get to work I have a as you know I had uh uh marketing for a big IT company uh worldwide so my job is taxing I put about 8 to nine hours of my job and that's mental thinking right yeah it's mental thinking it's different if it's just physical labor or something CU you could be mentally absent and this do your data processing but you got to be sharp with a team who's probably half your age oh yes team with half your age or people who are in my age and having different challenges seniors who are kind of extremely demanding hours and times and stuff like that so I just think that I think it's a it's controlled in terms of you know how do I recover so when I come back I know that glutamine and collagen most important you know carry it wherever I go like even in Bangalore my bag has collagen and glutamine with me saying oh you know what I had the run I have to have it so it it is just these choices that I have I have made because I just think that if I'm working with experts what is the point if I don't follow you you know you tell me uh sha you can't eat gluten but I say oh you know what I ran 30 km to CH you know I live in Delhi right so people swear by CH now that now like for example holy is coming guia I found somebody who makes glutenfree baked no way gluten free baked date sweeten call I'm calling you up you're sending that across you know it's like oh my goodness how did that happen my life suddenly started looking up but I have made those choices if I wouldn't get that I'm happy not to eat but but the problem is that you know you give into your Temptations I think it's just simple choices that I made that's what has helped me sustain simple you know you talked about your work and heading a large Global it company's marketing Division if you had to run your own company and you had people working with you would you encourage your employees to take up physical activity would you encourage them to eat healthy so I would make Fitness as a part of the whole appraisal process saying that you know it is a mandate like like if you know uh these uh a lot of the shoe brands who have Offices here they have this practice that you know you have to mandatorily be doing one hour of a gym and things like that so it would be part of their their regime and routine it's it would be like a mandatory code of conduct if I may say and Ryan Fernando would be doing nutrition for everybody and very interesting I want to share with you actually love to uh kind of ensure that you know charity begins at home kind so you know you start with practicing it with uh everybody on that note you would also know that I ensure that my mom goes to gym and follows a fairly uh decent eating plus supplement level like she also takes glutamine and collagen and all of that all ctsy you she goes to the gym every single day gy as she does resistance training of course she does like she sends me video where she's doing like 80 kg 90 kg leg press and stuff like that cool she's she's 65 so here's the thing if mahash go had to recommend to the women of India the modern women of India um some advice what would you take out from your book of wisdom to them watch where you're investing most people go to parlor for beautification and doing skin care and healthare and everything like you said and I love when people say that my skin looks very nice maybe some of it is genetic but I think I am feeling and looking the way I am looking because I'm taking of my body from inside not from outside you know like I I don't get a facial or a thing like that done I'm not I'm not trying to look up look down upon anybody is doing it I'm just making a suggestion that maybe balance it out of taking care of your body not just externally but internally as well because internal will reflect externally instead of buying a solitaire what what 10 lakhs maybe invest in a nutritionist and get back into a wellness regime which is a combination of your Fitness the right kind of food uh mental wellness and you will automatically start looking the way you're looking I I don't remember when I last I think two years ago I got a facial done because I was going to my cousins wedding and and everybody in my house is like they're we're bongs right so everything is about gold and decking up and I'm I'm nowhere there and I said okay at least let me play a tiny role so I just seeing that Mak smart choices you know people who are on a nutrition plan specifically when they're doing it with me I still remember I was working with the leading U tolywood which is our part of the world Bollywood actress and uh she came to me three months later and she says like you know what the cameraman asked me Madam so she came to me like I haven't gone for a facial for 3 months what have you done and what most people don't realize is that skin is the largest organ in the human body you put in the right Foods uh you open up the post and and for for the viewers out there like most of my guests who come in and put tons of makeup on this is her glowing skin there's no cakes of makeup on her so the the process over here is running enhances oxygen running enhances the damage to the body which is positive in terms of the growth hormone that comes the next day to reheal your body so you become younger and third is the Dal chavel rooty that you're eating correctly minus the gluten by the way gluten is huge in hyperpigmentation research has shown that most of your rosacea ecmia soris Vitiligo which are skin conditions are triggers of eating the wrong food where your autoimmune system slaps yourself so right now the only slapping that is happening inside of your body is those two hours of workout that you do every day which is a positive most people do it from food and that food when it slaps the body well you get it on the lips to the hips kind of thing and the skin starts degenerating I I will I will tell you something which is really uh funny and uh so when I first started with you you gave me this collagen I have right super expensive or whatever at least then it felt like so I used to be like I don't know what this thing does I don't know why it's giving me all this you know it's so expensive like first youa and then the supplements are also like this and I I used to be like you know like I had it but I think I was like do I really need this like is it go go and today the is always it's in your it's in your suitcase back it's in my suitcase back and it's like a stock of it in the house like you know what if you know tomorrow suddenly as if I won't get it or something I'm having which comes from the moon so it is a mindset change that happened not because of anything else but but realizing what it is doing to me you know I think that realization today my mom has like like collagen and all my I think all my friends who are not even into fitness they have also started having collagen looking at my skin like their reasons are different but at least they started having collagen so I hope you're taking supplement dotin collagen because that's the collagen I designed and I share a secret with you when we were designing the product we put in the right amount of vitamin C grape seed extract and glutathione in very minute quantities but the reason why collagen is important for you is not the skin yeah it's your soft tissue boom boom boom pounding the pavement every day right so what people don't realize is collagen or gelatin these two guys have a certain amino acid in it which the other food chains uh of protein you do not get those two amino acids readily available so actually your body doesn't absorb collagen you eat collagen your stomach acid rips it apart into its designated amino acids you absorb those amino acids now your body's like hey Baha you've given me Proline and hydroxy Proline what are we going to do with this the Skin's like hey buddy you know we need some we need some Proline and hydroxy chorine if you got some extra so literally I'm like a drug dealer to you you know providing you that that necessary bump up and then the next thing that people ask me is there any side effect and I always tell people if it's found in the human body so collagen is found in the human body so it's like saying vitamin C it's found in the human body if you take a little bit more vitamin C not too much of it so you don't need more than 10 grams of collagen a day the thing is the Indian diet is deficient in collagen yeah and all the manufacturers that are manufacturing vegetarian collagen they actually hoodwinking the public so I will uh tell you twoo two stories the reason I actually don't mind having collagen now is because I realize that you know and this is a statement that my physio made a few months ago is that I'm seeing your body transform as in terms of the muscular structure it's like it's becoming more like an athlete and all I contributed to is one is the training running routine and the second is you and I'm not saying this because you're on a podcast I've been here with you for for long enough to know that how much I trust you uh so that was the big reason why today I know what it is doing to my body especially uh when it comes to running because for me everything is the world is about running right if it's good for running if it's good for me then I will do it I don't care how whatever whatever as long as I have the money pocket to if I can afford it I will do it I I'm a white colar job person I don't have black money so but uh I had a friend I have a friend she's a runner and she had been having her knee trouble for a long time very good runner but I think she'd been injured for a long time so one day I generally run alone but that particular day I think was happening and she was like sh do you take collagen I said of course I do I like two times a day she's like I I said you don't so she said no you know I'm vegetarian I said collagen is all vegetarian she no no it comes from some whatever so she's Jen okay she's like strict about not having all of this and she was like no no I don't think so I can have you know types things I tried really hard to convince her and uh there were others also who were really laughing yeah she's a runner she's a very good runner but she' been having her knee injury for a long time so then she started having collagen and she did a super strong NDM she's a New Delhi Marathon that the full distance no the half the half so still 21 km of pounding on the joint but but she say she started having collagen and she says that her her knee starting to feel better so I mean for all those of you who think that uh the the skin part that we were actually making fun of is actually a byproduct you know for someone like me for whom running is the world I think uh it is it is doing so much good to not just me that others who are kind of trying to adapt ad remember when when you first started me it was like what about way protein right and U don't get me wrong way protein is really good but the moment you understand your gut symbiosis with a food be it Dairy be it gluten be it collagen be it animal protein be it vegetarian protein the problem is people try to make nutrition fashionable yeah it's like oh you diet diet run with Solomon so I should run with Solomon but maybe mine would be ax because my feet structure is different so the same applies with with nutrition you know you're a busy bee you do a lot of work you do a lot of running you do I mean it's like 140 km a week I don't even drive that distance someone ask a question what do you do on your off days do you ever relax so I'll split that into two parts on off day so there's off from work and there's off from training now off from training is a Monday which is not off from work so off from training is when I actually do the physio maybe do some Mobility uh you know spend some time doing meditation which I do any which way daily and then I just focus on work now off from work is when I actually chill out because they also my long run days which I really really love so I get to run longer and then you also give me cheat meal in my off days so I do take cheat meal and I'm sure you will ask me what I eat what's you cheat me for everyone out there what what does this lady do on a cheat day I I I know you love my hometown which is Goa yeah so I'm I'm a hardcore nonvegetarian so my cheat meal is usually a lot of thie food uh because I don't eat gluten but I now we have a gluten-free P pizza place in Bangalore in sorry in gura so then I do pizza but OCC but actually my go-to food would be a lot of thigh food because uh it's glutenfree and you know all the sushi and everything so you like spicy food uh not really uh but then thi food is because it's my it's my cheat meal and it's the only luxury I can have so then go for it so and and I'm not like too much of an Indian Cuisine like butter chicken is not something I would go for on a regular cheat meal day I might do it one off and as a Bengali on your rest days or cheat meal days are there any books involved so that's what so on my rest days I on the weekends I typically I love to read so like last weekend was like a really high I started a book on Saturday and by Monday morning I finished the book so that was like an perfect rest day for me otherwise I also am a uh movie junkie so I love to watch movies and if it's in the theater then all the more better but then have you ever fallen off asleep in a theater because you're so tired from a run never I've never fallen off anywhere when I'm not wanted to sleep never ever uh and uh so I I either watch movies or I do Netflix uh I love the suspense thriller so I like watching a lot of these Thriller Netflix series and I I actually like to take the downtime you know sometimes I keep my phone off like I know I I do I do believe in digital downtime which means that I would not watch anything anything on the screen no phone no Netflix no screen nothing I just probably just try and do cooking or things that that would relax me which is not the usual so I kind of take I really focus on saying that how do I want to ensure that it gives me the uh hit refresh in the true sense of mental and then for the physical of course is the Monday when I do the physical rest part of it and once you recovered and rested and had your cheat meal and you come back to a training day what is your training day look like so I wake up around 4:15 between 4: to 4 4:30 in the morning and then I'm out what's your sleep time uh around 10 10:30 and uh I you need an alarm clock to wake up I do because uh I think I just I've just gotten used to it but I do tend to wake up around the same time even without an alarm but I do keep an alarm but I don't use the phone for an alarm by the way I use I just don't like to keep the phone next to me or the digital and I don't check my phone till 10 10:30 in the morning usually unless if I know that there's something pressing at work and I I'm expecting cardiovascular surgeon neither am I I have the same thing the other day I got a client messaging me on the food diary and I checked it only at 9:00 in the morning when I walked into the clinic and uh it was a panic message about the scale not moving so I just chuckled because you know I'm like you didn't have a heart attack but to that person is like I stepped at the wiing scale at 6:00 a.m. in the morning and you were not available till 9:00 you know so I think we need to detox a little bit on the pressures of you know being instantly available and the cortisol stress that comes into your thinking and body actually contributes to weight gain I remember uh you telling me this and uh I think it was because of my age and whatever my cycle schedules I was having some sleep trouble and you told me saying do you spend a lot of time on the screen and I said well yes that's my job uh and then outside of that and I said okay I can't I can't take the screen away from my job but I definitely can take screen away from my rest of the time so so I keep the phone outside in the study it's charging and then uh you know I I put a regular alarm clock uh which the old school one kind so I I really enjoy very difficult to get nowadays I recently went to buy one of those old school with the two bells and God and I'm searching for it it's not very easily available but but speaking of alarm clocks you know we need wakeups to start our day so you're getting up by 4:30 in the morning alarm clock's going off what then so I I get up and then I I'm a coffee Junkie A little bit that you know so first shot of coffee then I get ready I step out to run I'm usually out to run by 5:30ish depending on what my schedule is maybe earlier but never later especially because you live in G and it's very very hot so you got to finish your run early finish my run by whatever you usually 7 7:30ish and then traditionally customary coffee that happens at the cafe in the in the neighborhood uh where I come my partner joins if the other friends who are running it's it's like a open thing whoever is there and we have lots of friends who regularly come there so even if not my my circle of friends come there other friends were there so we have like our whole banter of whatever 40 minutes an hour they come back home and sometimes there is gym sometimes there is no gym maybe gyms lat later in the day uh I kind of set up breakfast for my family uh I change get ready do my Puja meditation uh lay breakfast for the family and then I hit walk by 11-ish 11:30ish and uh I think 12:31 is lunch uh and and through this time I just get up I take lunch and then I get back to work and then sometimes there gym in the evening so then I take that break for an hour I go to gym uh I mostly work from home uh because my uh work timing is mostly UK shift so I start around 11 11:30 and I go to late night so then I do the jym for an hour and I come back I do dinner back to work and then I finish work around 9 9:30ish then I take some downtime with my family which is uh like either read a book or do something whatever maybe just go out for a little drive or uh watch something and then go to sleep by 10 10:30 that's my typical day uh Monday through Friday so that's a typical day and that's you going go go go go and training during season uh but what is your off season like do you completely drop off uh in terms of your entire schedule now on what does your nutrition look like in the offseason days so cuz I have a lot of marathon runners and all the offseason they just go book just just get off the bandwagon they stop doing a nutrition plan so what's your offseason like honestly I don't believe in anything called as offseason you know I mean I think for an EV every athlete who's got to be in the sport it's like that that you cannot all you cannot go below base and in interestingly today morning I was running with somebody I met for the first time and that person was telling that every time he finishes a run he stops running completely and then he only starts like 18 weeks before the race and I'm like you're at sub negative how would you 18 month 18 weeks how would you do a marathon again so I am always in training as you know uh yes the training intensity varies depending on how close I am to a race Etc according to that my nutrition plan also varies saying you know if I'm say in a low volume period uh versus a high volume period obviously the diet and the supplements needed the recovery needed and all of that is is varying but it's never a state where I don't know what offseason is because I don't understand that why would you not train because the moment you don't train for 4 weeks you're going to go back like 6 months in your training routine so why would you do that you know I get two weeks of break after a race and then I start training again the intensity gradually builds up from there uh you know training for the next race that is coming up but I don't remember having a time when I'm not really training or I'm not into nutrition the most important mistake I think most people do is that when your Peak is low is when you also lose focus on nutrition that's when you put on weight that's when you lose all your strength and then you have to start back from scratch and most of the times we come back with saying oh you know what now I have to lose 5 kgs and then get to my training then just imagine how how messed up your body and your whole system and your routine isn't the poor running coach does he focus on getting you back to base or for building your base so I think my base is always there be come nutrition bead I am I am just you know how paranoid I am if my weight goes up like for me it's like hell break so I'm I don't think I ever let go I might take smaller breaks like say I usually don't drink whenever I'm training but if if I'm not at say a close to a race day I might have a drink I think that's the only variability I would do outside of that it is I would like to say that this is my way of life it's not something that I am doing for a particular cause if tomorrow I am wherever and whatever I'm doing I don't think nutrition is going to go away from it because it's it's my way of life it's very simple for me you tell me what to eat what supplement to have how much to eat why do I need to break my head over it like you know I was telling I wish my cook knew or my help new to read your chart give it to him saying it's like so much easier so I I just think it is it is the biggest respite I have in my life you said that you know you were never an athlete and now you've conquered one of the most grueling races in the world I get so many people coming in for transformation diet plan diet diet and then when I see you doing the regimented nutrition which is scientific how does this mindset and motivation I mean because you didn't have it in school or college am I right and now suddenly this is mindset and motivation to make it a way of your life so first of all what do you say to yourself in your head and um how do you keep yourself going is there a Nasha of Victory or something that happens with you and that's why you're always there you're turning up every morning I don't think I'm driven by Victory I'm driven by the process I love the fact of where I was to where I've come and that didn't come in one day it's a 20e story like if you I don't know if you've seen my 78 kg picture if I I did I remember if you if anybody sees that and this I know most people who see it for the first time saying this is a lie I said why will I lie I mean you know this is me so I have I have seen that trans transformation the the point that people make miss out about transformation it doesn't happen in a day it has taken me two decades it has taken me a Ryan Fernando it has taken my running trainer it is taken my physiotherapist taken this whole team to be where I am and it will not sustain if I leave any of this so in like in digital transformation in because I'm working in tech people say right that it is not a it is not like you shift change one gear and it is all done it is a holistic development that you have to do now I think I think that transformation that I have seen is my motivation and now that I am here I know that if I leave it it's going to go back because it's like elastic the moment you leave the tension it's going to go recoil to where I was it will it will take me what 6 months on the tops to go back to that 78 kgs at Max you know how my body functions right I mean I'm sure you'll agree how easy is that going to be now I think one way is to look at that the second thing is is that the way I feel the way I am and the Wellness in me which is not just my physical but mental also comes from this process I think knowing you know it's like that that once you have tasted these things you would do everything to keep it and I think that's what I do in terms of motivation I think I seek daily wins you know like when you when you when like you said the 140k week for me that was a win I said oh you know what if I'm able to do this 146k week well I'm going to treat myself to Hot Chocolate now I have whatever hot chocolate at my home but I said no I'm going to go to this place and have that hot chocolate it's like nice and thick and sugary and I said you know because I earn that so I always keep this whole reward and recognition mechanism for myself nobody's going to give me I don't want it from outside I want to do it for myself saying you know 146 if I feel that I have done satisfactory well to my satisfaction of Performing this 146k week I'm going to go treat myself to this I think that's a way of motivation now I I first said you know what I will have Aman croso or then I said no no I'll have a tusu I eventually because I wouldn't have any of that it's gluten and whatever I eventually said you know what hot chocolate because it's good for recovery so you know I have tweak those likings in my life and that's what keeps me motivated to keep going I think people look at it from a very long perspective and therefore they lose traction and they do not break it into I I always say this have the smart goal concept make it measurable have have smaller goals short-term goals win those move to the midterm goals therefore you will reach to the long-term goal it cannot happen in one day it cannot happen in one week it's it's an ongoing ongoing process as I say it's a way of life I think that's the only way to stay motivated a lot of women are going to be inspired about this reward and recognition and how you've started and how you don't need an external affirmation to yourself but it's your own goals and then you meet it and you get there um and so I think a lot of women are now watching us and getting very enamored we've done hundreds of blood tests over the last few years right and I've taken a lot of blood out of you and throw some insight on how important do you think is the blood test being able to change your behavior your diet plan your training regime uh and should the endurance at see you've been on the side of the fence as a marathon runner minus professional sports nutrition and now you're on the side of the fence with a professional sports nutritionist how do you think the blood test have helped you from being an endurance athlete I'll give you the first example I don't know if you'd remember when I first came in my cholesterol used to be high uh not not because I mean there were there were multiple fact I think because I didn't know a lot of the nutrition uh knowledge that I have today working with you plus some amount of uh family history uh I have a family history of everybody having heart disease and all kinds of stuff so I think today my cholesterol is pretty much normal I don't take any medication so that's a first indication now why I'm telling you this is a comfort that when I see a whole family with heart disease cholesterol shooting up sugar going out of the away my my mom said everybody's diabetic you know I lost my granny to you know losing kidney failure and passed away and things like that I think what has helped me is to the confidence that you know my body is I am not inviting these diseases into me it's a it's a way of control it is a it is a report that whatever I'm doing it's like a result report card you know I do six months of studying it's like it's like the semester scheme I had in engineering 6 months you study you get a report card you give your exam which is the blood test you get a report card you say you know what all good okay okay A A A okay this one B Ryan this is B what do we do about it then we go into a fixing mode saying okay maybe let's let's get into you know uh fixing this or or whatever reason it is high I think over the four years we've reached a stage where everything from B has also become a so today when we look at the blood test I don't think for the longest time we have needed to do any corrections we've kind of said yeah all's good you know now all is good can we make it better I think that has been the focus which is a big shift from here saying this is high so we need to correct and make sure that your cholesterol is low to today saying that you know what can we improve your hemoglobin further SE for it will enable you to better run so I think this whole blood test Journey that we have done of hundreds of blood tests from being correcting to health perspective to Performance has has been the journey that I think we have had to put it very very simply So speaking of the health corrective process of the blood test and then the performance the performance part of the blood test right so obviously you are I could give you an honorarium Sports Nutrition degree right now with the amount of work that we have done together so from the supplement point of view uh what are your health supplements and what are your performance supplements I think from a supplement per se gone are those days when we had we started with health supplements I think you know where we said okay we need to take your cholesterol under control we need to take care of your this and that today everything that we are working on is mostly to say how do we ensure that uh you know your your performance is enhancing and your recovery is being taken care and also considering my age how am I able to sustain this did you ever have this thought process that oh my God you know Ryan's given me these 22 supplements I remember there was one race that we went for there was nearly 22 supplements now people might get shocked out there but was there that thought in your head like oh my God I'm taking so many powder spills and gels versus to what is your thought process today I when I first time when I first started I think the first very month when I saw it and I was kind of like uh I looked at it and I was like okay and my question was that how long will this be sustainable you know honestly if I say but today uh the way it has helped me to fill in the what my food cannot give me probably or my body's ability to absorb that food I know what that supplement how it is benefiting me so I don't think I ever think today I think I cannot do the other way around you know if I have to sustain what I'm doing I can go back to 78 kgs I don't need to do any of this stuff I'm going to save this money and buy the Louis Vuitton and I'm definitely not going to come back to this chair again but I think for for me to sustain and if I want to continue doing it with my age coming up being a woman with my cycle fluctuations and all of that I think it is just only only only enhancing me working towards my performance helping me to deal with you know the whole menopause thing the the most whatever dreaded m word in the women's world I think I'm able to sustain I only have fewer moments of those darkness in the whole menopause cycle versus probably a lot of people and I would give it to you for all that all that we are putting into together so I think there's no straight answer to what supplement I think is a whole combination that comes in it's not about one one multivitamin or one Omega or one D3 like most people do but it's a combination of all these aspects together saying what I need for my performance what I need to recover what I need to deal with my menopause I think those some of those things that you give me are horrendous to have but I I still remember I'll never never forget that zinzino oil I was like oh my God who has it I'm like every time I have it I'm like Ryan what are you making me have like you know and for those who are hearing this name this is uh this is one of the most uh highly recognized Omega-3s which come in from Iceland so the arctic cold fish uh combined with olive oil and shows that your omega-3 doesn't Den nature and these guys don't put into capsule because you need to uh Bond it to olive oil and um you you can't take like 500 mg in a capsule it's not enough so we need like uh 20 capsules that's 10 GS of the oil in a day and um so I always tell athletes you have no taste buds you know at the end of the day I I always say this to people a lot of people like I I remember i' gone home recently and uh somebody asked me so uh what do you eat for dinner and I said usually chicken and some kind of like you know salad and whatever so my dad was sitting next to me and he said you can't eat what she eats you know she he just clearly made his blatant statement you can't eat what she eats and I said well it's tasty my my dad said well for you so the point is that I think the definition of taste is it's an acquired taste you know I am the same person who loved this plush chicken curry and today I just love my boiled chicken with some basic spices into it literally boiled or air fried in my new found love but it's just that I today as compared to that whatever taste I know that this is good for me I feel good eating it and I think that feel good is far more Superior to whatever taste like I have my cheat meal to to taste whatever I want to taste but it is only that moment anything else for most of the time if it's not good for me I like saying yeah you know what Ryan's going to die thinking this and I can't have Ryan dying so don't have this simple so I think sometimes I do think I will say this sometimes I do think oh you know what I really loved eating this now I discovered that this this whole concept of loved eating it now in your mind youve preset what do you call uh emotions or triggers of saying that oh yeah I liked having say PKA on panipuri on the road that is what I liked but today when I eat it do I enjoy it as much no I don't now the moment I realize that then I realize that you know my liking is of the past of what I didn't care after that I had I felt acidity or I felt uncomfortable or that I didn't have any awareness oh oh you know what all girls having by the roadside very happy uh but today I don't feel like that so that that change has happened over the years and today it's it's all about what is good for me and I mean I I think I love the state of being that I am so you know you talk about the supplement and then you know you hate something and then there's a routine and then you begin to love it the routine part I think is what helps everyone get to a new sense of realization and speaking of routines we didn't talk about your Marathon running routines so how does that work for the uninitiated outside who maybe somebody's like very inspired by you having at one point in your life being 70 plus kgs and now you're one of the fittest woman I know your skin is glowing um you know you're very disciplined and even boiled chicken seems to appeal to you and your father says though you can't eat what she's eating this is a new afar this a new you many women out there many athletes out there would be inspired by this where do they start 5K 10K 15K 25k the full Marathon ultra marathon what is your training regime how is it evolved over the years I think the first key is to start you know you don't need to find a perfect solution to your problem the Sol the problem is that you know we we kind of want to find the perfect routine on day one and be be me in end of 30 days I think the message that I would like to have everybody have is that you know start small start with realistic goals for yourself I didn't set out to become 78 to being this person I didn't know I didn't have a vision of this nobody I we didn't have internet at that time to know I didn't have Ryan Fernando I didn't know MDS I didn't even know Marathon like you know was out of question I mean I in in my time in 2000 the first gym I went to was a little Cordon of place in a men's gym and we had a separate entry to that place because women were not welcomed in the gym at that time that's the era that I have begin this journey on now today we have access to everything I mean there is there every possible Fitness tool that one can think of as available so I think the first step is to just start small and have a realistic goal for oneself that you know why do you want to start it the second thing is discipline resilience and patience I think most of us lack there you want to do five days and you feel so great that you go and Hell break on day six you know and then day seven never comes after that you got to be at it like you know I've not been keeping well yesterday I came down and I was down with the cold today morning I got up and I wasn't feeling my best but my training routine said I had to do the 22k what I absolutely dislike to do is to tell Jason okay yesterday was a bad day I couldn't do it I rest in I'm not saying that you know you go but today between sleeping and going to run I knew that if I run I will feel so much better as against trying to just be lazy it's not that I was like anything major happened that I couldn't run so I think if I if you bring that discipline into your program in whatever you are doing with that a little bit of resilience because there are going to be bad days you know especially women have a lot of bad days you know during your Cycles you're like going nothing over it you know and a lot of people have their painful Cycles like you know I get bloating like hell but the point is that even then all you got to do is to show up for yourself the moment you do that then over a period it becomes then it the first time is the toughest the second time you already have the experience then you third time becomes easier fourth time becomes easier and I think it is just those those three four things that we need to kind of keep at it most of us fail out because we don't have discipline like you remember in the whole concept of timetable when we were kids saying you know we had a home timetable during holidays saying TV time sport time everything so I think we got to just have it there I have a I have a check mark uh calendar for myself for the year I started doing this last year and I did a Blog also about uh saying that how I scored over the year and I put a is this blog open to the public yeah yeah it is open to it is it's called My Boran and is open to public to people my borin I don't write as frequently as I would love to but but it expresses who you are yeah it expresses war I've written some of these things so so this one was about my scorecard you know and and it was simple about I it it has two simple tricks there a green tick and a red cross the green tick means that everything went well like physical wellness mental wellness and I felt okay and I'm not saying great because okay is good itself I mean you know why do you why is okay not good you know that means why is okay not good I think that's a nice statement yeah because lot of people think that oh you know what things are things are okay well things are okay you know it could be so much worse you know you could have had one leg gone your car would burnt out or you thrown out of your job your parents are healthy glass is always half full correct for me okay is great you know the days I feel okay is green tick the days I feel miserable is a red tick now miserable can be that I had a bad run that is that I couldn't do uh I I didn't I had a bad meditation or I felt too stressed about something in Life or whatever is a Red Cross and I diligently follow it I do it every day before I go to sleep I go it's put on the wall I go put that take now what it does is to actually monitor myself like oh already seven crosses this month I need to Buck up you know I need to just focus on why are things happening helps me to keep correcting myself so I just think that people need to people need to just focus on some of those uh planned strategic moves of taking care of your own life you know I recently on a session said that are you an entrepreneur of your life or of your career most people aren't you know we just live by accident that like today I had an option I could have said oh you know what I have to go to Ryan's podcast and all that I'm not feeling well let we just sleep the let's cancel the run I mean okay I will tell let will be an x on your calendar which now you're fighting to not put on your calendar tonight correct correct so so so I think I I I would love to say that I I I have a job but I'm an entrepreneur of my life I I decide and I want to ensure that my life is profitable so I I am really really conscious about what investment I'm doing that is so powerful sha because you know as a health coach that's so powerful I see people and you see the film stars you see the celebrities you see what I call you as an elite athlete hitting your goals you have that resilience you have that drive and most people after they leave College they're not accountable anymore because that report card is not there that tick mark Or that X is not voluntary being submitted and you know the only um exam that you technically answer is your annual oper raisal because you want to get a better scor card right and when a lot of people don't get that scor card they're very unhappy that you know it was their god-given uh entitlement entitlement that they should get it but in the basics of their life forget the job they're not keeping a checklist they're not keeping the tick mark on the X and uh that's what I tell a lot of people when was the last time you held yourself accountable because it was your school teacher or principal that held you accountable and I think in most um relationships I think sometimes if one of the spouse or both of the spouses have this tick mark they hold each other accountable to a certain extent but I think your body is your true life partner and therefore you need to hold it accountable absolutely it it's like you know most people say you know I'm not saying can be I mean I'm I'm a human being I can I can have an heart attack or I can have organ whatever can happen I don't know but I at least know that I am trying very hard in a planned action working with experts to not have it or delay it I probably that 78 kgs could have gone 85 and I'm sure I would have had a heart problem by now because it's in my jeans my entire family has has heart conditions and cholesterol and triglyceride and fatty liver diabetes I am 100% sure I would have had it by by my age my dad was already diagnosed with a heart condition so I still don't have it it's a win for me will I not have it 5 years 10 years down the lane I don't know but I'm consciously trying not to have it at least at least make that effort for yourself 10 years down the line I will be sitting with you and saying hey you know what Ryan we did well we tried you know and and I think we did well we delayed it from 45 to 50 isn't that a win itself like why would one not do it I don't understand speaking of wins and getting into running every morning I know you have a win every morning in terms of your pre-marathon meals sometimes when you go up for a marathon and all so what is it and how much time prior because for the uninitiated out there they don't know that when you have to start at the starting line you're turning up sometimes at 4:35 in the morning at that location from your hotel so walk us through what is it the night before the preparation and your pre-marathon meal so uh even the pre-marathon party oh yes it's my favorite uh so so before the marathon I think the the previous night or the day I usually like like to eat really light and clean very clean like you know Ki is my goto dinner and eat really early why is that I think it's just easy light to digest keep the fiber low avoid any kind of load on the stomach because like you said that if you have to show up at 4:30 you're waking up at 2:00 you know uh you're kind of exposing your body to your body is not used to the thing so as light as you can keep it focus on hydration what happens is see people do this oh we have to eat pasta before Marathon we eat carbs and all our meals why do you need pasta it's not like you eat pasta every day for dinner what is special today that you're having pasta carb loading happened for the countries where their staple diet is very different than ours our staple diet we are carb loaders we are carb loaders we are eating carbs in Italy Dosa sambar rice Roti chapati parata that's what we eating so what is this whole pasta so you see most people are suddenly going and eating this binging in that pasta whatever Outlet I I just stick to my kery I drink a lot of water uh you know eat light give all the supplements that we do uh you remember this one time I think which really worked when my first season of Berlin when I qualified for Boston we actually practiced the time duration of Berlin like I used to eat at 4 o'clock get up at some 2 o'cl try to go to do party and then go back and sleep again is revealing all the secrets we train professionally in different time zones yeah because because I think so so that whole ensuring that your stomach is clear you know you don't have to rush to poty you know if you're looking at your time trial or whatever you don't want to lose 2 minutes going to the L with the discomfort that you carry you you want to feel good there's a lot of stress stress in holding your poty in and trying to do a marathon getting up early and trying to get the poty signal so many of those things yes so I think I think a little bit of practice a little bit of consciousness of what you're eating not trying to do pasta parties before that you know that really helps before I can't believe it that you know that we have thousands of marathon runners and 99.99% of them never ever do a nutrition plan yeah because because as they it's not nutrition right all's good like you know people think I think people think I'm a little bit of a showof that I work with Ryan Fernando and and you know as if I have a lot of money I have a tree which like gives me money at the end of the month which I give to you but people people don't see that see it is not just for the sport it is about me and a combination of mean totality which is my age my gender uh the stage at where I'm in life my profession I cannot afford to do a 2hour run and feel sleepy in a meeting I'm sorry I have to show up sharp I have to show up as a leader because that's my job that's what they're paying me for so how do I ensure that I'm in that state if you're not there in my life it's as simple people don't see it like that what people do is choosing I don't there's no magic but I think also people are very conjus in terms of their expenditure towards their own body versus they will buy that 40,000 rupe Footwear but when it comes to the knowledge of what to do when to do and how much to do that's like I can wing it that's the next level people are willing to pay when they have the disease but they do not want to get a health checkup or a blood test you ask anybody for when you did your last Health checkup they will say blood test you know that I get a regular Health checkup done every year which is like full head to toe and the uh blood checkup blood uh report by anually people don't do it there's a lot of these incidences that you're hearing during these marathons and poor I feel really bad that people are spoiling the name of the sport it's not the sport that's causing people heart disease it is your lifestyle it is about being callous about it it is about that you know you started running today and in 3 months you're running a full Marathon for somebody who's never done any sport screening no screening done you don't know if you have a pre-existing condition you you you're obese and you're not really taking doing anything about it speaking of obese you know the other day um most of India's obese because the level is of BMI is 24.6 or 24.7 and half a dozen of people that come to my clinic they're all at 26 27 and they feel they're at normal weight and they start Marathon running yep and that extra load on your blood on your heart and on your knees actually causes you to have a side effect of damaging your body quick ER than a lighter version of yourself a healthier version of yourself yeah so so people don't see it for uh for a gain or a health or a wellness perspective for them saying you know as they say know the running a marathon is a bucket list and then from there it is obviously has a lot of uh other miscellaneous things you you know you get to travel it's obviously fun there's a Runners High there's all of that but the some total I think that whole point that it it is for your health it is for your well-being is being uh erased faster and faster and faster and therefore you're seeing all of these cases and yes people are people don't know where to invest they rather invest in a funky Jazzy car in a house in buying solitire and jewelry and I don't know what all but they are not willing to invest on uh you know a good nutritionist or even a good training plan yeah I see people coming into the gym and trying to work out themselves and their form is so wrong and I'm just thinking you've turned up in a luxury German vehicle but you're being so conduced about paying a trainer 15 20,000 rupees a month just to get your mercedesbenz in pristine shape yeah so a this is uh this is that this is her whole attitudinal shift that we need to have in this we to get different awareness yes marathon is a very um hard hitting sport on the human body lots of injuries we talked about it you explained a lot of things uh people who start running they don't know that see heart attack is one of the serious side effects so you need to do the screening and everything but there are smaller slaps that you get from running marathon running as the distances as the mileage uh go up you talked about blisters when you did the MDS but chaffing uh you know skin getting abraded is that something that every Runner will start to face see there are reasons why shaing happens uh and especially for women also yeah the most common reason and women get a lot of sharing around the sports bra uh Cuts like I used to wear the chest strap and I stopped wearing it because it's not designed for a woman women's body uh shaing happens because of uh particular reasons is that of course uh the fat which you know your skin bruising around is one reason so my recommendation is that you wear something sleev so you ensure that the Skin's not bruising around it but then the other reason is that uh you know the clothes fine fiber uh with use has has Fine tears and then they are the ones who actually cause the abor they become the microscopic fibers start getting pulled out and now they look like microscopic needles correct which is rubbing around your skin especially if you're doing for a long time so it's my discovery that so typically when I go for a race I try and wear everything new but not brand new right not brand new like I probably only want it once or twice I so I I do uh race day training gear training which is where I wear the same attire same shoe everything and then I replicate and see okay all is feeling well this is good to go for my race so we're get race day train I'm smiling because we do the same thing for the nutritional supplements we never ever give a client and I've seen people in Marathon runs there's a stall of a Sports Nutrition Company and they're handing out these smoothies they're handing out these gels and people will be like okay I'm going to try this in the marathon Race you you train your stomach also to run I will give you an example of another uh you know someone who runs at the same place I run and he had the gel for the first time in the New Delhi marathon and he he had to go to the like twice and and of course I mean so for for the uninitiated out there when you take a gel most gels are polysaccharides and some of them are based on kagene which is a type of seawe uh or it could be uh a malose based gel and each one of us have different responses like I do know people who will not tolerate algae or polysaccharides or Malto based gels and it'll just run through your system yeah so so I remember the first time I took it I I had a friend running with and I had to uh I was running in G and then I actually had to go to somebody's house because there was no wash mushrooms there it was like some it was not under my advice right no it was many years ago many years ago many years ago because I got and I and we and I knew like you know my friends who were having it told they watch out yeah so my advice to to anyone watching in would be that you actually take the gel when you're working at home yeah to see gut Comfort first correct you try any supplement when you're sitting down at home you know the L is just right over there and you can go and if nothing happens the first time then you do it on a shorter run yeah but um come going back to the shaing and everything you made a very valid point on trying your race Gear Running yeah so from that perspective do marathon runners change a lot of set of clothes equipment uh and gear on them see marathon is a fair how expensive it is if I were to take up Marathon running this year so I would spend how much on shoes and outfits and then maybe let's say do three or four marathons in a year and travel in India what would an average person spend uh never calculated it but like let's say you would need uh decent shoe three pairs of shoes is what you would need and see there is no limit these days like people want to buy the most expensive shoe uh and then people have the money to get like two pairs of the same and then they mix and match colors and do all kind of funky stuff oh yes oh yes I know a lot of people who do that so they buy say they will buy two pairs of the most expensive shoes of two different colors and they wear them opposite like for all the style ction I don't do anything I I can barely afford to get just one p for my think your body from inside is thinking yeah dude I'm going to make you run faster because one's blue and one's yellow yeah that's a new supplement so so so so of course the shoe is the most important and critical part of it uh the the next is the attire I mean you can uh you can start from basic to go to as far as you can go to and I don't want to name brands out here but you you know the top end Brands and versus that so there's no limit to it I think what one would really like to focus on is a good training uh good trainer you know wherever whoever however you would like to choose to a good Physio and most importantly a good nutrition which is if you put all of this it is an expensive spot but what happens is that people do they think that do you go run and you go run and you then you run and then you run and then you get injured and then when you get injured is when you go to Physio when you spend money and then you struggle and do all of that I'm of the other opinion that you know I have a trainer I have a professional I've always had a trainer I've always had a Gym trainer if I remember from the first time I went till now like I have always had a Gym trainer you know I don't remember probably I think if I took all the money that you spend on Gym trainer you'd probably been able to afford a German luxury vehicle by now I would have I could have I would I probably would have two houses in Mangalore if I would have saved all the money that I've spent in this sport you know and uh I've been training with J with with my running coach uh Dr Jason car for like what four years now almost almost same time a little over four years I think you start at 5 with you I'm going to start five uh I I mean I think I've always been to the gym uh I have speaking of the gym I'm trying to picture you in as a workout person because I just see you in the MDS running so what's your workout Style do you like working out in the gym oh I love it I mean I strength training it's very funny okay that if I'm exhausted and I've had like I'm super tired and I drag myself to the gym and 10 minutes of workout I'm a new person you won't believe it 10 minutes and I remembered that recently I think I went to the gym I was very sluggish I walked in and that lady looked at me and said I saw you running how much did you run I said whatever I don't remember and and then he said oh you should be resting what are you doing here I said this is the only way I can rest if I'm here at the gym you know so what's your favorite exercise then in the gym I think I there's no favorite I just love working out in the gym I think there is uh I can tell you what I don't like you know that's very simple I just don't like lunges you know I just for a run I just tell you I can like my trainer is struggled to get me to doing lunges I just don't like lunges anything else you tell me I am happy to do it I mean so even the leg press and the everything everything I have know I love working out core and leg press and back and all of that uh only only thing I don't like is those lunges I do uh to answer your question on my workout I do me medium weight strength training because I don't want to load my body I want to just do enough strength training so that I am I have the strength the idea is not to break the body I remember you at the start of today's podcast you said that you've been weight training from the beginning that's how you started your weight weight loss Journey you have probably two decades of weight training experience yes what's your advice to the young women of India who are starting their job should they enroll in a gym should they go for Zumba should they go for Marathon running should they go to the gym uh is going to the gym going to make you get muscles like anel schena so what what do you what would you tell a young girl walking into the room right now you know the first thing is that that that thing you said that you know you get muscle like Anish Scher I just first want to tell everybody that women do not have the hormones to develop muscles like Arnold shener or Rik rosan or tiger sh so for God's sake just stop thinking like that women kind of poked you because you know you're an ight Runner um you run in shots so I have people been snidey and said oh look at her legs they're so muscular have you ever got that comment I'm asking this from a perspective because women think that they weight train or they run they'll get muscular so they don't do the physical activ so I want to call out women from that perspective of thinking so that they don't use it as an excuse to not go to the gym and train or run I will tell you the other perspective when I go to the gym there are so many men who walk up to me and tell ask me saying what do you do for your legs okay so so the men are jealous of your leg the men are absolutely like you know my car so A6 when I was in a six athlete and you can they would typically do this one particular shot of the shoe with my Cal from the back to show them show the Cal you know because they thought that I have the best looking Cal that whatever Delhi and we need to get a picture probably so it's so yes I do get a lot of compliment for for that and it is a combination of my strength training and my running so every young girl for in college going into her engineering degree or whatever degree she's doing going into her first job searching for a prospective uh partner uh to having her first kid or delivering her first kid and then doing weight loss should she weight train every woman wherever you are you must and should weight train just giving you some context our grandparents were doing weight lifting in their day-to-day jobs like you know lifting water my grandmothers to pull water from the well what work is that yeah you know your lats work out your arms work out bicep tricep everything okay washing clothes working your shoulders yeah you know lifting lifting water and carrying it back weighted walks weighted walks farmers walk is what they did so women have been doing weight training ever since it is just that we just lost ourselves in between somewhere and we thought oh my God you know what I'm going to have like Rik rashan's body type you cannot have it but but look at our grandparents they were so much more stronger they were so much more healthier they had stronger bone infrastructure look at our parents generation for example I think they are the most uh they have neglected their bodies the most and the you know why my mom goes to the gym I told her I said you get osteoporosis and you keep breaking your things I live in gura you are in Kolkata there's no way I can show I have a full-time job so you please take care of yourself first something happens I'm there but it'll only come if you first take care of yourself it's a clause so you watch out that day and this day she calls me and says my collagen is over can you send me if I ask her sing what do you want for your birthday she'll say get me something for the gym every other day she wants a new sh is she fashionable in the gym absolutely all she wants is gym clothes and gym shoes and you know she sees my new shoe and she's like oh she's ouling at my shoes all the time she oh that shoe color is so nice but your mother in her younger years did not work out so this is something that you convinced her to do of course so the point I'm trying to tell is that our lifestyles have changed therefore we have made this as an activity outside of our day in older days it was a combined effort like you know what is the definition of Fitness Fitness means that you're able to do your day-to-day activity with comfort and with ease that is what fit means now people have merged all of these and made one nice kery of fitness and health and building muscles and all hormones so why if our grandparents did it why is it that you I mean our lives today don't help we have a washing machine a dishwasher help cook zato swiggy whatever so we are the laziest people in this world so then you got to got to just bring in that extra activity into a day just to ensure that you are you're growing stronger in your your physiology and your mental as you go ahead in life and especially for the younger generation you have a whole life and Trust You me it's a right that you will have of your life wherever whoever you are so dude this is the only way to get up you know you you was we talking about your mom who's the older version of you and now she's ouling your gym clothes and stuff that she is weight training if you had to go back in a time capsule and meet scheta who is 15 year-old what advice would you give her I would I would actively actively pursue sport my uh you know I'm born from I'm in a from from a small town durgapur very conservative traditional I mean uh all my uh sisters got married when they were 18 thankfully my parents thought different my when I uh I mean they always wanted me to study and I also knew that there's the only way for me to get out of this whole setup and do something in my life I didn't know what to do but I definitely knew what I didn't want so that that was the only differentiator I think I would definitely have developed these habits uh you know when I was 15 like if you remember when you saw my Gene report you told me this that sh if you had come to me 10 years ago I would have made you a sprinter you would have been the best Sprinter in this country and not a marathon runner if I knew that I I would be able to do or what it does to me as a person I would have just only changed that I think I I was not interested because I didn't know I was like it didn't give me any cake because I nobody taught me that it is good for you only little bit of playing in the evening what did we play at that time hide and seek and some kind of silly stuff we played so that's so you're asking girls of today to upgrade from hideand-seek to knowing and getting into the gym working out encouraging parents to encourage their daughters to become fitter versions than they are today absolutely because it is it is more important because you know as you grow older your your options to do this reduces so you better develop the habit now because the more you grow old it is so more so much more difficult to develop these habits right I mean you know we are such slaves to how we have been that if I tell today to bring a change it's going to be so much more difficult we need we need external guidance to develop inculcate certain habits so so develop those habits in your children today especially children today and it's a responsibility of the parents because in the world of digital where everything is happening on a click of a button I mean one click in you are gone so you better backck up now speaking of Clips we coming to the end of our podcast so we're going to do some rapid fire clicks um few questions okay um and quick clicks three things that you'll carry when you go to the gym water uh I think a jacket and uh my watch top three habits that made you a great athlete discipline patience and not fearing to spend getting an expert team wow it's an habit your favorite cheat meal honestly Pizza which is not glutenfree but since I refrain from it I think th your biggest inspiration in sports and why that person I have a lot of sports people I look up to you know and uh I think Federer dhon uh for people who who Show and Tell I think they have been consistent over years I especially especially like doni because I think he is he's always shown uh everything that a good athlete should have which is most importantly a good attitude you know coming from the background that he's come I think he's he's he's been a tremendous Sports person if not a marathon runner Conquering the MDS one of the most grueling races in the world and another life what would you be a tennis player so still Sports still Sports yeah I have I always always admired tennis and when I was in Bangalore I actually used to play tennis uh and uh I think I would be a tennis player professionally if you ask me I'd probably become a professor or a doctor because that's I wanted to become both you are now the professor of running and the doctor of all the physiology in the human body because in my opinion sometimes she looks at my nutrition PL like I think you forgot to give me L cartin because my fat percentage has gone up a little bit too high and I'm like oh yeah yeah you're absolutely right so Maha go is been a privilege to have you in the same room as me uh thankfully you're not doing this interview with me walking because it's a nice long interview and if we had to do this walking thank God we covered only 1 cm today great to have you today on my show
