Transcript: so Kenny why do you think nutrition is important I think it's very important because as an athlete and as just you know for daily use uh um you know it's very important for your body to be at the utmost like be at its peak um for a Sprint team for me it's very important because I need to make sure that I'm recovering right and making sure that I'm having all the energy to be able to Sprint the uh the first 100 meters and then the last 100 meters and the 200 meters so um if you had to choose any foods that really give you energy what would be your best um the good stuff good stuff and the bad stuff well we just ordered pizza so I say pizza as the bad stuff and the good stuff I like uh I like steak medium rare and sweet potato with broccoli awesome and um what is your advice to Young athletes um while watching you if you had to go back in a time capsule and meet can you use 14 years of age nutrition point of view what would you tell that kid I would tell them to do their best with their nutrition because I mean when I was in high school in college I ate like trash uh eating hot Cheetos having Skittles before races and I mean if you have a dream to become an elite athlete I think it's better to start out um you know sooner than later especially at a young age and it's also just healthier for the body you know finding out that I had uh the whole gluten problems and all that um I didn't find that until later but you know it's continuously damaging the body when you're putting all those toxins in so you know that's the advice just uh if you have a dream to become an athlete uh Elite athlete at the highest stage start early and it'll make everything easier later on awesome because I'm writing a book on gluten at the end of this year on how you should do the testing and come to know about it I mean gluten sound and pastries and bread and pizza all my favorite things yeah but now that you found out that you're Gluten Sensitive and you're eliminating it from your diet did you actually see a difference in your training in the weight room in your performance and yeah you did see a difference which is making you kind of give up these things that you really like what's the thought process in that former not from a like oh my body's feeling better but just from the battle that goes on in your head when you you know to have or not to have uh I mean initially it was really hard I mean I got the test done found out my gluten levels were through the roof and went back home I had to look through everything and it's kind of like wow I can't eat this uh uh mentally it's so you're more aware of it now when you go to places yeah I checked for everywhere I go I check to make sure if it has gluten-free or not um I have cheat days sometimes but that's when I really deserve it and that's usually in the off season but I mean it's a battle every day I always you know go to the store I'm like I want this because I know it's going to taste better um but you know I gotta make sure to not take it because I do feel better and it helps me perform better at a better level and all that but um yeah just it's what's really hard about it is just the taste and finally it's tough but it's also like the gluten-free stuff it's healthier obviously but it's hard to find a a brand or uh somebody that actually makes it tasty like when you travel and all for the world championship are you like not on a nutrition plan yeah I have to be more prepared I gotta make usually when I go to competition overseas I don't usually eat the food that's down you know at the hotel because first of all it doesn't taste that good and then um it's not what I what I need you know we are we have a plan to make sure that I I'm you know the race is you know I get the job done at the race and um what I usually do is just order from out and I just make sure just to get what I need and make sure that it's gluten free so that's how I kind of manage that aspect when I go overseas but in the US it's a lot easier because I can kind of bring my own stuff and I'm familiar with the companies and all that but overseas is a little tougher but I still get it done weight room or track which is your favorite depends on the training yeah it depends on the training if the if the track is really hard I don't want to go to the weight room but then there's if it's easy I love going to the weight room it supplement that you have when you work out then you can feel the difference is it a hydration drink is it a RCA is it a protein powder what do you feel what what do you look forward to taking well it's not the beat the beat uh what is the beat yeah I take them but I I you what's the I forgot what it's called but it's some hydration drink that I put in the water in it okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so you like that yeah because it has a glitch is my thirst and it has a little uh good taste to it so what's your advice to uh people on working with professionals from the coach to the physio to the master to the nutritionists to the Mind core you know you're you're up there with some of the best in the world you want a silver uh at the Tokyo Olympics what is your perspective of working with the team uh it's good for basic communication with everybody the coach knows what's going on with the mental health and the nutrition so we can all communicate to each other and how much of a how much of like you know a load is it on you or how much of a relief is it on you what goes through your mind when you're like okay weight training I want to follow my Fitness training or follow the code is does it get heavy because for athletes out there everyone assumes being a champion is quite easy now every Champion has an entire supportive so what's it like what what goes on in your head because I know I keep telling you you gotta eat this and you're like I wish I could just die in a pizza yeah it's it's hard more mentally taxing um so it's momentum yeah more mental because you know I I have all these you know duties I got to do the these uh check marks I gotta bring on it and it's a lot of work but I mean it's worth it because at the end of the day when I end up getting the gold or silver you know I did what I needed to do to get to that point and it's a good feeling to to know that I actually did everything to get up to that point and you I come in more confident too when I know that I'm doing everything you know if I don't have my beaded or if I don't have this and that right before the race I'm gonna be kind of like okay you know I didn't do that so what's going to happen but if I do everything I'm like okay I'm confident I got everything done and let's go this can he cook barely uh if you had to make something for yourself what would you cook I can make salmon some uh some honey some honey drizzled salmon I just started cooking that and I can make a burger but I'm learning right now um I mean so far I've been ordering out all the time but so when you want it out are you kind of going to the menu like looking up where what's available and stuff like that yeah I look to see what it is and uh earlier would you do that [Music] yeah because I was tired I'd be like oh this is tasty okay listen I didn't think about any of the negative effects this has been replaced now with more planning on okay I gotta get my carbs yeah is there some protein in this yes yeah I gotta get some but I also try to still make sure it tastes a little good so I can enjoy you know cool any last advice to track and field athletes across the world uh just listen to your coaches and you gotta and then make sure to find a good team because if I didn't have a good team I want to be at the position I am right now uh be very difficult for me to even figure out what to do to make sure that I am you know running at the highest level but having a good support system you know nutritionist coach you know mental health coaching you know lifestyle coach you know everybody family it's all very important because you know it's going to make everything easier for you when you you know hear The Gunshot off and then at the end of the race if you were not a track and field athlete what would you be I love sports everything Sports uh so if I wasn't in track I would be I in football because I love football I think I love football more than track but track is safer so there's an intellectual part of Kenny if you were not into sport what other profession would you have chosen in another lifetime I was thinking of taking up uh Sports Medicine maybe be an athletic trainer or something like that so I I took a class in high school and then I was planning on taking one in college but they didn't have the class so I was going to do it later but um you know now I'm doing this so I got to figure out what I want to do now yeah maybe that or do some business or something like that but awesome really Kenny foreign
