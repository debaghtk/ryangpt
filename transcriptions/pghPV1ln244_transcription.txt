[1.28 - 5.76] hi everyone uh this is ryan fernando i
[3.92 - 7.44] am a nutritionist and i operate at the
[5.76 - 9.12] core nutrition clinics one of india's
[7.44 - 11.52] largest nutrition clinics
[9.12 - 12.96] i have a team of about 55 dietitians on
[11.52 - 16.24] board and
[12.96 - 17.44] they help people eat better right so in
[16.24 - 19.92] this period of
[17.44 - 21.52] covet when you're getting a vaccine so
[19.92 - 23.84] i've taken the vaccine and i had
[21.52 - 25.20] absolutely no pain at all and i have my
[23.84 - 28.00] second dose coming up
[25.20 - 29.76] in a few weeks suddenly somebody
[28.00 - 31.36] something struck me to first make a
[29.76 - 34.08] video on the vaccine
[31.36 - 35.68] my advice to you is as follows around
[34.08 - 37.52] two or three days before taking the
[35.68 - 39.36] vaccine don't work out when you work out
[37.52 - 41.68] you increase your inflammation
[39.36 - 43.04] so you want your immune system to be
[41.68 - 45.12] calm because your immune system
[43.04 - 47.20] also attacks your muscles when there's
[45.12 - 49.12] damage of muscle and cellular tissue
[47.20 - 51.12] so number one is one or two days prior
[49.12 - 54.00] to your vaccination don't work out
[51.12 - 55.04] second try and go vegetarian the
[54.00 - 57.52] documentary
[55.04 - 58.56] game changes showed that people on a
[57.52 - 61.60] vegan which is no
[58.56 - 63.20] milk no eggs and no non-veg diet have a
[61.60 - 66.08] lesser inflammation
[63.20 - 68.56] lesser c-reactive protein in the blood
[66.08 - 70.72] in this case when you take a vaccine
[68.56 - 71.68] what happens is it activates your immune
[70.72 - 73.52] system so
[71.68 - 75.84] instead of you having an immune system
[73.52 - 78.32] that is doing juggera or fighting
[75.84 - 80.24] with your non-veg with the chemicals and
[78.32 - 81.04] insecticides and pesticides coming from
[80.24 - 83.52] your food
[81.04 - 85.20] and any mental stress or exercise stress
[83.52 - 85.84] your immune system is at a very calm
[85.20 - 88.16] level so
[85.84 - 90.16] it's gradual acceleration when the
[88.16 - 90.96] vaccine attenuated vaccine comes into
[90.16 - 94.16] you
[90.96 - 96.96] is is better so efficacy is much better
[94.16 - 99.12] when you go vegetarian for at least two
[96.96 - 100.56] days prior to the vaccine and maybe
[99.12 - 102.64] three days minimum
[100.56 - 104.08] post the vaccine i would say up to 10
[102.64 - 107.68] days for a better
[104.08 - 110.08] performing back uh vaccination
[107.68 - 111.04] immune response in your body uh five
[110.08 - 113.04] final point
[111.04 - 114.64] alcohol is an absolute no no stop
[113.04 - 115.60] alcohol three days prior to your
[114.64 - 117.68] vaccination
[115.60 - 119.76] and at least for three weeks if you want
[117.68 - 123.36] a great response 21 days
[119.76 - 126.56] uh don't do alcohol these are my tips
[123.36 - 128.16] to ensure that the vaccination works
[126.56 - 129.60] better in your body and it's the only
[128.16 - 131.60] thing that's saving us today all the
[129.60 - 135.04] doctors in the world have taken it
[131.60 - 138.16] if the highest intellectual breed
[135.04 - 141.28] in healthcare is taking a vaccine
[138.16 - 142.80] then uni is a common ahmad me i mean i
[141.28 - 144.56] don't know why you're questioning it
[142.80 - 147.20] just get it done it might just save your
[144.56 - 147.20] life
