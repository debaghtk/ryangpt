Transcript: in the morning at around 7 o'clock you want to be having some sort of beans or lentils in the food which is why our South Indian food sometimes is really good because your sambar is made up of a lot of lentils so you could have a sambar soup or your vadas or you know you get certain of the English which can be made with the pulses they're really really good so you don't need to have a pizza or burger to become a number one okay you have to look at the food that will work for you have you heard of fiber what's fiber ruffridge so you know what is roughage could you give me an example of fiber excellent example fruits and vegetables orange why do you think fiber is important to a player digestion okay exactly I was waiting for the word smart bowel movement what's ball movement going to number two potty I share a joke with you imagine one Batman and COO player comes in heats all the protein eats everything very good round two the derivative inside over here stomach says hurtle no government formation today okay nothing's going to happen okay what will happen constipation next thing you know the back many players like on the back netcode constipation I have found players who have more fiber they go to number two regularly once or twice a day good dominant players older Backman and players above fifty five sixty cases of weight if you eat for your game you will definitely go to potty morning and evening you will definitely go twice a day because you're eating that many amount of calories now if it so many calories without fiber traffic jam like bundle guitar Road they like you're moving that the food you've eaten some rice with no fiber in it some potato no vessel it is going the run Bona gotta load slowly through a I decide InDesign is 22 kilometers long you put banana inside is like order each option is coming in okay so very very important for you to understand parents children don't like fruits but you need to give your kids five servings of fruit a day hobby Matt below surf punch banana dia give variety because you want to be giving them more vitamins and minerals okay [Music] everyone sleeps over here you know how many times a day do you sleep once anyone's gets an afternoon nap yeah good try and get an afternoon nap even if it's for one hour twice a day everyone showers over here anyone smelling right now huh I don't know in showers you know you know good player shower up to three times a day because they sweat so much okay hey by the way quick tip okay this is a free tip to all the players you want beautiful skin wash your face after practice don't use soap a lot of kids don't even wash after playing for six hours sweat is all dried up and everything I can see a few mother shaking their heads right now mom you think oh yes go edge of it my video games and all is happening what happens is the sweat dries on your skin in a something called fungus now fungus is here boss party agya on his skin there is nice salt and sugar and everything let's have a disco party over here on a skin what happens you start getting white patches called a fungal infection now parents it's a arrear I bought him the best racket for 10,000 rupees it's okay yeah a fungal infection what will happen when the body has to fight that infection now suddenly let's say he is the inspector of in infection he is the inspector of recovery I am food coming into the body I'm supposed to give energy to the body so I come in so he say wait wait one full battle is happening on the skin.you please give all the banana chicken and meat and everything to me I will take all energy to battle the infection this side inspector of recovery is saying what was made of payment kind then I say sir everything infection took why are you asking me so parents have to understand if your children fall sick very often there is a give and take between immunity and recovery and nutrition is like whom do I go do I go to recovery do I go to infection and obviously it will go for infection first so something as simple is not washing your face or skin or body of the sweat is reducing your recovery you heard it here first from Ryan Fernando so if you are smelling that's another thing nobody will come next to you but if you are getting a skin based infection it's because you're not being hygienic enough so please be good in your hygiene shave once a day maybe you shave if you've reached the age a huh poop once or twice a day you train how many times a day once or twice yeah twice can you train twice and its I study gym once if those of your older once a day how many times a day do you eat food even if you eat an apple a banana I call it one need eight eight to twelve is what the top-end athletes are doing let me tell you why if if these three boys you are going to school they will require an RD a recommended dietary allowance which will be 1,800 2,000 calories what were the height weight normally we calculated now they do three to four hours of training for our abdominal training is anywhere from 200 calories to find it calories so they are burning an additional 800 to 1500 calories a day which means all these three boys have to double the quantity of what they really require and this is where the mismatch between actual nutrition and actual of what happens because you are doing breakfast lunch and dinner like a mod me so sports nutrition is so so important for you to understand that it's forget winning the Medal you have to grow first anybody over the age of 17 over here in terms of the players know so you're still growing how old are you 18 so about 80 you stopped growing in boys in girls stop growing around 16 so these children require most of the nutrition today for growth like you can I recently had in Andhra Pradesh well very senior person came up said mr. Fernando I will give you one crore rupees if you can make my son grow another six inches I'm super excited on the phone sir what is the age of your son 21 sir boss Tony Kalia the age for girls to grow is 8 to 12 for boys is 12 to 16 want me repeat again girls growth 8 to 12 so girls 8 to 12 we have to eat correctly correctly don't start a self most girls children have this problem made a figure Technica my hips have to become better my bums looking too big in the mirror I know I have kids who are this age will be shocked parents girls have image problem today so they stopped eating and then you playing for hours of government on the court they're losing away muscle so body is now saying I've lost all this muscle so now the food that is going everything is getting stored as fat because the girl has gone into starvation mode famine mode so when people come to me and I see higher fat percentages I'm like you are not eating five meals a day mother said no no no I pack everything I know you pack everything is going to the friends in school so these are things that happen with the girl kid with the boy kid it's very simple he forgets to open the different box simple okay everyone laughing means it is true it is experience boss okay so do you understand the importance of this badminton players if you think the most expensive racket is going to make you I am saying the most expensive blueberry is going to make you the most expensive banana is going to make you the most expensive egg is going to make you the timing of the leg and the quantity of the deck or that pony or whatever it is is more important than anything else
