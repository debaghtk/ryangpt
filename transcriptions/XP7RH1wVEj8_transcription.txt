Transcript: hey guys if you're not able to watch my long form content of podcast here are some short form clips for you to enjoy North India South India this is huge dietary difference uh height difference body type difference pollution difference um are there any data coming up to you guys that says that people from South India should uh run faster for a testing people from North India should run faster with give us some insights so there was a recent report um I read uh which was conducted across several States in in India uh you know if I look at diabetes for example South and North are actually equally predisposed although Central and Northeastern parts of the country have less incidence of diabetes it's also an urban phenomena so right Urban population has more diabetes incidents than rural population but interestingly pre-diabetes is actually the the number is much higher than the diabetic population which is a very dangerous thing doctor for the uninitiated out there right everyone says diabetes diabetes diabetes can you in a layman term explain what is diabetes and then what is pre-diabetes yeah so diabetes is a condition where the body's ability to produce insulin is compromised insulin is produced from uh pancreas and when there are cells in pancreas that become nonfunctional the insulin quantity reduces and are body's ability to process glucose diminishes and hence you have high blood sugar and whence that blood sugar touches a certain threshold or remains Beyond a threshold consistently that's when we call you know it a diabetic condition I think South India overall has a slightly marginally higher risk for ncds overall so everyone if you're out here in South India let's all get tested pre-diabetic because we eating too much of carbohydrates or rice and our sugar levels have gone up diabetes and hypertension are I would say un equ distributed only the central part of India and northeastern part of India had less incidents of these two conditions among genders men have a higher predisposition for you know high cholesterol level than women uh so that was the other finding but in all of this I would say the biggest alarming finding has been the rising incidence of pre-diabetes across urban and rural areas so that you know I think today for example we have 98 million diabetics in the country we the diabetic Capital which 17% of all overall diabetics globally and I think we love our food and we love our sweets and also that the fact that we have this propensity exactly propensity as a population you made something very keen because my father-in-law is an orthopedic surgeon he's 78 years old and he loves he's from orisa and he loves his mishti DOI and rusas and all and he eats more sugar than I do right and he has an hp1c score of 5.2 so you mentioned some something from that part of India people have a diabetic resistant gene or something I mean they have less propensity L propensity for diabetic I'm just thinking I'm sure he's quite active isn't he yeah he's very active but I'm just thinking if we could just get that Gene you know and uh like eat our rascas more often but jokes apart jok's apart I think as a nutritionist people are eating far more than their fathers and mothers and their grandfathers and grandmothers we just did a food diary with few of our clients I I had the privilege of working with a family of three generations so I would ask the grandfather and grandmother how many times you ate out so they met out once a quarter at MTR and ate once a quarter because they didn't have that much of money right the father and mother met out once a month you didn't have that much money true the children are in MTR every third day right so so the incidences of external Expos and therefore when you go out no portion control you eat how much you want absolutely and with the new thing which I feel is that people are just eating more because they're stressed out like we work very hard and that's what that Grandfather said we did a 9 to5 job there was no SMS WhatsApp or or Zoom call at 7:00 in the evening which your boss gone to you so you stopped your day but your Generations are working double hard which means the brain is working so much so when you finish your day your life need a reward yeah yeah yeah or you're not as conscious about it also because you're so distracted with so many things that are going on I never thought about that right being distracted yeah and therefore you end up just uh consuming whatever how much ever without really being mindful about what's going on and since a lot of your followers like nutrition allow me to actually talk about my three rules around consumption the first is reduce reduce right um let's stop eating when we are 80% full Ah that's a nice thought yeah and so reduce the second is reorder proteins and vegetables and fruits first and then carbohydrates Oh I thought you meant reorder an aater get me another order I was like this doctor is really cool okay reorder means change the order in which you are consuming consuming yeah that's right so say that again protein first and veget protein and fruits and vegetables vegetables first first then carbohydrates so for example in our home the proteins come out to the table first get served first salads fruits and vegetables even if in a cooked form get served first so while it's first on your table even if you're mindless about it you're that's what you're consuming first and you get a little bit full and then come the carbs onto your plate right and so reorder and the third is replace where you can find a way to replace the processed foods that we are used to these days with a little bit more traditional foods like some of your millets or uh brown rice brown sugar jagu and so forth in reduced quantities right so allows us to then replace some of the ingredients in what we cook for an overall balanced meal but it's still the kind of food that we eat every day at home without putting pressure on the kitchen yeah sorry I just wanted to add I mean you know and you would probably I mean you're the expert this that Dean Nash's diet what have I got the name did I get the name orish Dean orish diet right that actually changing your dietary habits can reverse aging and reverse many of these conditions isn't that right so as as a celebrity nutrition test I make a lot of money doing that exactly exactly job so I meant it's just not the I mean screening is big part of it but I think diet and change in modification right I think going forward is going to be play a big role if can speak very candidly from a nutritionist or a doctor the screening gives you the wakeup call yes to wake up and smell the roses that you have only one body absolutely and this body cannot be replaced like your mobile phone laptop house and even spouse in fact one day I had an argument with my wife I said my body is my life partner she say what do you mean to say I'm your life partner I'm like look dude I had to get out of bed to get married to you the body went it got married to you you trust me very true our body should be our first love yes and so I told her this my wife is not hearing this yeah you like me like me I slept in the next bedroom for the next one week but but at the end of the day um you know when we do these screenings I have seen an instant disciplinary modification by my client the reason being is I'll give you an example oh Dean Onish told me to eat this diet plan Ryan Fernando told me to e this that plan but if your AI heart screening says you are predisposition to diabetes or heart attack in so many days then the person sitting down in the counseling room and saying what do I need to change yes it's the trigger for change the behavioral modification for change and I think over a period of time if genetic screening were to become cheaper and mandatory in some form or shape that would actually lead to you know Revolution so to speak hey guys if you've enjoyed this clip then click here and watch the full episode and don't forget to subscribe because your body is the most expensive real estate and
