[0.18 - 7.16] the boat shops thank you so much
[4.02 - 7.16] hi everyone good morning
[8.44 - 13.74] [Applause]
[10.44 - 15.36] you know 20 years ago I was 25 years ago
[13.74 - 16.16] as one of your students in the back over
[15.36 - 18.78] there
[16.16 - 21.84] probably not as smart as all of you in
[18.78 - 23.16] this room today uh I studied at Goa
[21.84 - 25.86] Medical College which is one of the
[23.16 - 28.38] oldest medical colleges in Asia I did a
[25.86 - 29.88] masters in clinical biochemistry and I
[28.38 - 31.50] was listening to all the doctors here
[29.88 - 34.98] and the future doctors that you are
[31.50 - 38.00] going to become and I run a very
[34.98 - 40.32] successful nutritional practice
[38.00 - 43.14] and I get very embarrassed when all of
[40.32 - 45.54] those accolades go up because uh I'm
[43.14 - 47.04] driven by changing people's lives and
[45.54 - 49.56] social you
[47.04 - 52.98] as a medical expert you have to
[49.56 - 54.78] understand that this subject matter that
[52.98 - 57.00] you are going to specialize in whatever
[54.78 - 59.16] you do you don't realize it but you're
[57.00 - 61.02] sitting in those benches today
[59.16 - 65.16] the people in the front over here are
[61.02 - 66.66] your teachers you expect the teachers
[65.16 - 69.24] to teach you
[66.66 - 71.46] I throw the ball in your court what are
[69.24 - 73.56] you doing to learn better
[71.46 - 76.02] because it is you who are investing in
[73.56 - 78.36] yourself so without any further Ado yeah
[76.02 - 80.22] this is all of my clients have I've
[78.36 - 83.40] probably worked with some of the best
[80.22 - 85.86] people on the planet because they
[83.40 - 88.98] believe that their body is the best now
[85.86 - 91.08] as a medical doctor thank you as a
[88.98 - 93.24] medical doctor the question is whatever
[91.08 - 96.36] your field of medicine be it Dermatology
[93.24 - 99.72] Internal Medicine Cardiology neurology
[96.36 - 102.48] whatever it is whatever you specialize
[99.72 - 103.74] I request you to take one thing away for
[102.48 - 107.28] the future
[103.74 - 111.06] while science drives all of us
[107.28 - 112.14] to have a very focused view like a
[111.06 - 114.00] microscope
[112.14 - 116.34] remember sometimes you have to take your
[114.00 - 117.96] eye out of the microscope and look at
[116.34 - 120.00] the world around you
[117.96 - 121.56] I know this because I have a few doctors
[120.00 - 124.38] on my team
[121.56 - 127.68] and the focus is so ingrained
[124.38 - 129.60] that you're not willing to step back
[127.68 - 133.98] from your education
[129.60 - 136.32] and ask questions so today my subject is
[133.98 - 138.54] not about me being an expert I'm only
[136.32 - 141.42] here to open your eyes about good
[138.54 - 143.22] nutrition and I thank Dr Jonas because
[141.42 - 144.90] I'm going to take his contact because I
[143.22 - 147.12] want to work with him now
[144.90 - 149.04] why do I want to work with him he
[147.12 - 151.50] pointed out four or five things on
[149.04 - 154.08] genetics and nutrition
[151.50 - 156.18] so whoever you work with get to the next
[154.08 - 158.94] level okay by the way if you want this
[156.18 - 160.32] presentation uh that's a QR code scan
[158.94 - 162.90] over there so if all the youngsters in
[160.32 - 165.12] the audience your QRS can code that on
[162.90 - 166.98] Instagram you message me I will send you
[165.12 - 167.70] the entire presentation this is what I
[166.98 - 170.64] do
[167.70 - 173.70] and my presentation has been designed
[170.64 - 175.32] not to give you the scientific study but
[173.70 - 177.60] point you in the right direction and
[175.32 - 180.36] each point is hyperlinked to a
[177.60 - 182.82] scientific study which I expect you to
[180.36 - 185.21] do your reading if it interests you okay
[182.82 - 191.46] so let's get started
[185.21 - 192.96] [Music]
[191.46 - 195.24] okay sorry
[192.96 - 196.92] so
[195.24 - 198.84] if you read this I'm going to turn
[196.92 - 201.66] around and read it with you Thomas
[198.84 - 203.88] Edison it was an inventor the doctor the
[201.66 - 205.62] future will give no more medicine but
[203.88 - 207.90] interest is patient in the care of the
[205.62 - 210.84] human frame in the diet in the cause and
[207.90 - 212.70] prevention of disease this is 1903.
[210.84 - 216.08] okay
[212.70 - 216.08] how many of you have heard of
[216.18 - 220.08] chat GPT
[217.74 - 221.76] we're in 2023
[220.08 - 225.26] you've heard of it
[221.76 - 225.26] how many of you have used it
[225.60 - 231.06] now I ask yourself this question
[227.94 - 233.10] start thinking as medical students you
[231.06 - 235.38] have company you have brain
[233.10 - 237.84] you got to put stuff in here
[235.38 - 240.18] you got Google you've got chat GPT what
[237.84 - 242.58] are you going to become in the future
[240.18 - 243.90] artificial intelligence Among Us why is
[242.58 - 245.82] this guy going
[243.90 - 247.50] he's supposed to talk about nutrition in
[245.82 - 250.02] the brain
[247.50 - 251.28] I'm asking you to start activating your
[250.02 - 255.12] brain
[251.28 - 258.18] the first part is using your brain
[255.12 - 260.16] who will you become and I always start
[258.18 - 262.14] my lectures not about the subject matter
[260.16 - 264.00] but how is it going to influence your
[262.14 - 265.92] future you guys are doing brain research
[264.00 - 267.30] you're changing lives of people what do
[265.92 - 269.28] you do you change people's lives
[267.30 - 271.08] students what are you going to do talk
[269.28 - 272.70] to admin what are you going to do ma'am
[271.08 - 276.12] what are you going to do we change
[272.70 - 281.16] people's lives in some small way
[276.12 - 284.04] and if I can inspire you on one thing
[281.16 - 286.26] I I've probably trained around six seven
[284.04 - 288.66] thousand medical professionals because I
[286.26 - 291.66] am a good nutritionist
[288.66 - 294.36] the one thing that I see in people is
[291.66 - 297.72] greatness when they practice
[294.36 - 300.54] not on subject matter expertise
[297.72 - 302.82] but on human connect
[300.54 - 305.10] please understand the brain is what we
[302.82 - 306.24] are talking about today you will get
[305.10 - 309.48] older
[306.24 - 311.04] and in your own body frame as you get
[309.48 - 313.56] older
[311.04 - 317.10] your science is going to be ancient what
[313.56 - 319.56] I learned in 1996 in Goa Medical College
[317.10 - 321.24] going to the library and all of you have
[319.56 - 323.46] about 45 years of age will understand
[321.24 - 325.44] what this means in the library
[323.46 - 327.96] the youngsters here do not know what
[325.44 - 330.18] that means all the youngsters here are
[327.96 - 333.06] this
[330.18 - 335.16] so you've got to know that your patient
[333.06 - 336.24] bedside manner is the most important
[335.16 - 338.10] thing
[336.24 - 340.86] and the dean of Goa Medical College used
[338.10 - 344.94] to be my mentor and she says Ryan
[340.86 - 347.76] when the patient walks in don't be stuck
[344.94 - 350.58] in your notes
[347.76 - 353.52] look at the patient walking in that will
[350.58 - 355.20] give you all the signs in 30 seconds if
[353.52 - 357.12] you're a great practitioner
[355.20 - 358.68] so don't be stuck in your notes when a
[357.12 - 360.60] patient walks in when you walk into the
[358.68 - 362.04] room and I'm sure Dr arvind does this
[360.60 - 364.02] all the time when he walks into that
[362.04 - 366.06] room he's looking at the patient talking
[364.02 - 368.46] the patient understanding it's where the
[366.06 - 370.44] brain first starts from your brain to
[368.46 - 373.20] your patient's brain okay
[370.44 - 374.94] so let me start with the most important
[373.20 - 377.46] system you all guys and medical guys
[374.94 - 378.66] know that these are all the systems in
[377.46 - 381.72] the human body
[378.66 - 384.06] my perspective to you is clinical
[381.72 - 385.62] biochemistry yes brain performance Dr
[384.06 - 387.12] Jonas went into some things and he
[385.62 - 389.34] touched upon a little bit of what I'm
[387.12 - 391.56] going to talk about
[389.34 - 393.90] this is stuff that cause nightmares for
[391.56 - 395.58] me I don't know if you get nightmares
[393.90 - 397.76] memorizing this for your biochemistry
[395.58 - 397.76] paper
[397.80 - 403.32] I have some I have some solids to offer
[400.56 - 406.08] you don't worry
[403.32 - 408.24] okay you may be bottom of your class the
[406.08 - 409.38] important thing is to understand what
[408.24 - 411.72] you are studying
[409.38 - 413.64] don't try and memorize it because 30
[411.72 - 415.74] years later you will not remember it but
[413.64 - 419.34] it's important to know what citrate does
[415.74 - 421.86] in a PCA cycle or what is the measure of
[419.34 - 423.54] Diagnostics in the biochemistry which
[421.86 - 426.00] will help you ask for a test and
[423.54 - 428.46] interpret it tomorrow
[426.00 - 430.08] forget about memorization the world is
[428.46 - 432.42] changing I know I might be short today
[430.08 - 435.72] for saying this in a in a teaching
[432.42 - 437.70] college but the word is going to change
[435.72 - 440.28] and so you're gonna have to rely more on
[437.70 - 442.14] your bedside Manner and your ability to
[440.28 - 444.42] join the dots
[442.14 - 446.40] remember this statement ability to join
[444.42 - 449.16] the dots is very important so I want to
[446.40 - 451.26] start my lecture about
[449.16 - 452.58] sharing something in your own life so
[451.26 - 455.16] that you'll remember this lecture
[452.58 - 457.56] there's something known as how quickly
[455.16 - 459.84] do cells differentiate in your body
[457.56 - 462.68] okay and if I can step up over here
[459.84 - 464.52] without doing this can you see over here
[462.68 - 467.22] let's take
[464.52 - 469.46] white blood cells two to five days
[467.22 - 473.04] what is this
[469.46 - 476.34] stem cells two months bone osteoblast
[473.04 - 479.90] three months liver hepatocytes five
[476.34 - 479.90] years what is this one
[482.30 - 486.36] so the reason people's brains go bad is
[485.04 - 488.88] because they're not taking care of their
[486.36 - 491.70] health simple
[488.88 - 493.28] yes it's genetics I know but then doctor
[491.70 - 496.56] also mentioned something called as
[493.28 - 498.42] epigenetics what is epigenetics the
[496.56 - 501.60] environment on your body
[498.42 - 504.00] now if you understand that fat cells are
[501.60 - 505.74] replaced every eight years all other
[504.00 - 508.62] parts of your body replace within two
[505.74 - 509.76] three months so as a nutritionist when I
[508.62 - 512.28] change
[509.76 - 513.60] the raw material that goes into your
[512.28 - 516.42] body
[513.60 - 519.24] if the raw material is correct
[516.42 - 520.74] to all the uh all the plus 40 people who
[519.24 - 522.84] have built your own house over here
[520.74 - 524.58] right when you build your own house
[522.84 - 525.78] either you're buying a flat when you're
[524.58 - 528.00] negotiating with the builder you're
[525.78 - 529.38] going like what tile did you use what
[528.00 - 530.88] window did you use because you're going
[529.38 - 532.08] to live in that house for the next 20 30
[530.88 - 535.74] years
[532.08 - 537.54] those of you are youngsters when you buy
[535.74 - 539.28] clothing
[537.54 - 541.26] most of you look at the brand when
[539.28 - 544.64] you're young you don't look at the
[541.26 - 544.64] quality of the brand
[544.98 - 550.80] so I want you to understand this one
[547.62 - 553.20] thing that if the turnover rate as of
[550.80 - 554.94] the human body you're a doctor that
[553.20 - 557.28] means you're constantly reconstructing
[554.94 - 560.70] ourselves what is the number one thing
[557.28 - 562.92] that your patient needs to focus on
[560.70 - 565.68] think about it the raw material that
[562.92 - 567.30] goes into the human body and I I I don't
[565.68 - 569.52] know about how many of you but I get
[567.30 - 571.20] very stressed out practicing a lot I've
[569.52 - 573.90] got film stars I've got celebrities I've
[571.20 - 575.46] got a 75 member dietitian team they give
[573.90 - 577.20] me a lot of gray hair
[575.46 - 580.34] I love to Garden
[577.20 - 584.70] ing gives me one perception in science
[580.34 - 587.58] if my plants are fed correctly I talk to
[584.70 - 589.80] my plants I play music to my plants
[587.58 - 591.48] they don't die in eight years they're
[589.80 - 593.40] with me for 16 years instead of eight
[591.48 - 597.06] years what I'm trying to communicate to
[593.40 - 599.82] you is epigenetics okay so
[597.06 - 602.22] anyone knows where this is in Bangalore
[599.82 - 605.96] yeah UB City most expensive real estate
[602.22 - 605.96] most expensive real estate
[607.02 - 611.88] what's the statement over here and I
[609.00 - 613.08] know this is a CMA but I want to inspire
[611.88 - 614.40] you to take care of your health first
[613.08 - 616.02] because in taking care of your health
[614.40 - 617.70] first you will become the best
[616.02 - 619.50] practitioner in life because your body
[617.70 - 621.78] is number one and you learn from that
[619.50 - 625.26] perspective your body is the most
[621.78 - 627.30] expensive real estate in the world
[625.26 - 630.24] think about it doctors
[627.30 - 632.22] I may come in here in a luxury vehicle I
[630.24 - 634.32] will change that in five years
[632.22 - 636.12] you will buy a beautiful house you will
[634.32 - 640.44] change it maybe in 10 years because you
[636.12 - 643.14] got a nice pension bonus PF whatever
[640.44 - 644.82] but can you change the human body I
[643.14 - 647.40] could go to Dr Jonas and say Here's One
[644.82 - 648.78] Core rupees can you change my brain
[647.40 - 651.54] no
[648.78 - 654.42] so we are understanding how either
[651.54 - 657.42] somebody who's sick has come to us
[654.42 - 659.52] or somebody who is going to break time
[657.42 - 662.28] would you agree with me that in the
[659.52 - 664.98] human body this is the most uh important
[662.28 - 666.96] real estate the brain the gastroes will
[664.98 - 669.30] be saying no no no no
[666.96 - 674.10] it is the digestive system because if we
[669.30 - 675.78] shut up the whole body stops Okay so
[674.10 - 677.46] having said this
[675.78 - 679.56] these are the general statements that
[677.46 - 681.24] you want to look at your brain is your
[679.56 - 683.28] best asset nurture it balanced diet
[681.24 - 685.44] quality blah blah blah blah now as
[683.28 - 687.60] medical students you'll be like this is
[685.44 - 690.54] not scientific
[687.60 - 694.68] I request you whilst you are getting
[690.54 - 697.80] trained in extreme scientific knowledge
[694.68 - 699.48] also practice with your patients common
[697.80 - 701.58] sense
[699.48 - 703.46] I've interviewed half a dozen doctors
[701.58 - 707.34] last year to hire them into my company
[703.46 - 709.86] common sense is lacking because when you
[707.34 - 712.98] meet with a patient patient doesn't
[709.86 - 715.26] understand scientific study patient
[712.98 - 718.20] understands Common Sense coming out of
[715.26 - 719.28] your mouth so communicate with common
[718.20 - 721.56] sense
[719.28 - 723.42] communicate with science with your peers
[721.56 - 724.74] in this room which is why after this if
[723.42 - 727.26] you ask me any questions I know nothing
[724.74 - 728.82] I will go to my chat GPS and say oh yes
[727.26 - 731.16] this student asked me this please give
[728.82 - 733.26] me the answer it's very important to
[731.16 - 736.82] understand this so
[733.26 - 740.82] I follow Dr Daniel Amen on the internet
[736.82 - 743.88] and he speaks a lot of logic and there
[740.82 - 746.82] was a scam many years ago that I saw in
[743.88 - 749.16] terms of the brain scan okay so this is
[746.82 - 751.92] the healthy scan of a patient from the
[749.16 - 753.96] top down and from the underside and this
[751.92 - 757.92] is when there is abuse 10 years of
[753.96 - 761.52] alcohol cocaine okay it's smoking
[757.92 - 763.92] so it got me thinking one is
[761.52 - 767.76] I come here for a lecture today
[763.92 - 770.82] okay and I come with flowers so I come
[767.76 - 773.58] with nutrition I come with protein carbs
[770.82 - 777.62] omega-3 ginkgo biloba phosphorylene
[773.58 - 777.62] phosphorylcholine on the other hand
[778.44 - 782.76] Lati
[780.18 - 784.38] alcohol
[782.76 - 786.24] um what else what could what else could
[784.38 - 789.30] be negative
[786.24 - 790.62] smoking alcohol smoking this is common
[789.30 - 793.32] what else
[790.62 - 796.26] would mental stress play a crucial role
[793.32 - 798.48] right so whilst we say hey we can do
[796.26 - 800.46] games and stuff like that and train the
[798.48 - 802.08] mind and Sudoku and you know play with
[800.46 - 804.42] the brain and stimulate the brain
[802.08 - 807.78] there's also a negative to that
[804.42 - 809.88] so when I see people coming to my
[807.78 - 812.34] nutritional clinic now I have a very
[809.88 - 814.86] privileged practice
[812.34 - 817.68] you being in a teaching college you will
[814.86 - 819.90] cater to all segments of society so it's
[817.68 - 823.02] important to have your demographic open
[819.90 - 826.50] for extremely poor people
[823.02 - 830.22] and extremely rich people
[826.50 - 832.98] so your thinking has to accordingly be
[830.22 - 834.60] the Sherlock Holmes
[832.98 - 835.32] I hope you all know who Sherlock Holmes
[834.60 - 836.88] is
[835.32 - 838.44] okay I thought I was too old in the
[836.88 - 840.60] junction few people have said they know
[838.44 - 845.10] who Sherlock Holmes is
[840.60 - 847.26] the brain ages okay so with the hods of
[845.10 - 849.48] all your departments and me now we need
[847.26 - 851.22] to start doing our Dr Jonas we need to
[849.48 - 852.78] start doing more silico puzzles and take
[851.22 - 855.54] more omega-3 with your permission
[852.78 - 857.94] because at around 45 is when our decline
[855.54 - 859.98] starts hey you youngsters behind if you
[857.94 - 861.78] smoke if you drink and you party late
[859.98 - 863.82] and get lit less than eight hours of
[861.78 - 865.86] sleep there are already sleep studies
[863.82 - 868.38] showing correct me if I'm wrong sleep
[865.86 - 871.26] deprivation causes brain vascularity to
[868.38 - 873.12] drop I know this because I need to make
[871.26 - 875.34] Virat Kohli score centuries can it
[873.12 - 877.68] benefit run faster and I have half a
[875.34 - 879.60] dozen chess Champions with me now I
[877.68 - 881.82] don't have the privilege in my clinic to
[879.60 - 884.82] do the scans
[881.82 - 886.62] the simplest thing we do is we track
[884.82 - 889.74] their sleep and we track their heart
[886.62 - 892.80] rate the lower their heart rate the more
[889.74 - 894.84] relaxed they are the the better their
[892.80 - 897.06] sleep is the faster they perform and we
[894.84 - 900.54] see that VO2 max and all so when I do
[897.06 - 902.82] that with the sports person when
[900.54 - 904.38] um Vijay shekhar Sharma paytm comes in
[902.82 - 907.32] or
[904.38 - 910.02] um tiwari of inmobi comes in
[907.32 - 911.76] they are also can I make my brain better
[910.02 - 913.08] can I make my body better because you
[911.76 - 914.94] can't change this body
[913.08 - 917.28] so please understand you will get
[914.94 - 919.32] lifestyle people coming to you and you
[917.28 - 921.48] those are called vain people
[919.32 - 923.16] so if I come to you I'm like hey tell me
[921.48 - 924.90] how my brain can be better I don't have
[923.16 - 926.52] a problem that's vanity
[924.90 - 928.56] and then you have pain people who comes
[926.52 - 930.36] to you dementia Alzheimer's Parkinson's
[928.56 - 932.52] so as Doctor you need to see both ends
[930.36 - 935.58] of the spectrum but yes
[932.52 - 937.80] the diseases do accelerate your your
[935.58 - 940.14] brain uh drop
[937.80 - 942.36] and I was so happy that you mentioned
[940.14 - 943.98] the apoe 4G and I thought nobody would
[942.36 - 945.24] have talked about this
[943.98 - 947.94] so
[945.24 - 950.34] eyes do a lot of speaking and recently I
[947.94 - 952.14] was asked to talk about omega-3 at
[950.34 - 955.50] another symposium
[952.14 - 960.36] now whilst many in the medical community
[955.50 - 964.70] will say there's not significant proof
[960.36 - 964.70] I am going to spin your head slightly
[965.76 - 973.46] how much of scientific proof do you need
[968.46 - 973.46] to do before you prescribe a better diet
[973.50 - 978.60] it's common sense
[975.54 - 980.52] if there are molecules that improve my
[978.60 - 982.56] question back to you is what is the harm
[980.52 - 984.00] of giving omega-3 so where you need to
[982.56 - 985.98] go into deep dark
[984.00 - 987.90] I I try to make this from the scientific
[985.98 - 989.16] study as easy to understand as possible
[987.90 - 993.00] okay
[989.16 - 995.76] so Alzheimer's disease the apoe 14 this
[993.00 - 999.48] is a cholesterol management Gene
[995.76 - 1000.62] so you have apoe one e one two three
[999.48 - 1003.26] four
[1000.62 - 1004.90] so just imagine this Gene the four guy
[1003.26 - 1007.22] if you four
[1004.90 - 1009.44] controls how your cholesterol management
[1007.22 - 1010.58] happens and what they found out in this
[1009.44 - 1012.14] study was
[1010.58 - 1016.46] when they gives
[1012.14 - 1020.48] nutrition DHA DHA supplement was given
[1016.46 - 1024.98] they found that the apoe non-carriers
[1020.48 - 1026.42] absorbed it but the apo4
[1024.98 - 1028.82] carriers
[1026.42 - 1031.52] they did not absorb it now as a
[1028.82 - 1034.94] nutritionist I was like Hey I want to
[1031.52 - 1037.16] prescribe a nutritional supplement
[1034.94 - 1039.26] so if everyone comes to my clinic and we
[1037.16 - 1040.58] have not done the apio gene as Ryan
[1039.26 - 1043.76] Fernando I'm giving them an Omega
[1040.58 - 1047.06] supplement but it's not helping out
[1043.76 - 1050.44] but what I further read in the study
[1047.06 - 1053.24] what I further read in the study was
[1050.44 - 1055.40] phosphorylated DHA do you know why
[1053.24 - 1057.62] phospholated DHA comes from
[1055.40 - 1059.90] fish
[1057.62 - 1062.18] so now I'm now I'm stuck with a gun
[1059.90 - 1065.18] between my head do I give fish oil
[1062.18 - 1066.02] supplement or do I give natural fish in
[1065.18 - 1068.96] the diet
[1066.02 - 1071.18] so medicine genetics have taken me to
[1068.96 - 1073.22] the next level to say could I do the
[1071.18 - 1075.68] genetic screening
[1073.22 - 1078.86] and by the way I don't do this for
[1075.68 - 1079.58] Alzheimer's patients anybody who comes
[1078.86 - 1081.32] in
[1079.58 - 1083.30] is asking me they want to become like
[1081.32 - 1084.98] Virat Kohli
[1083.30 - 1086.84] they want to be sharp they want to be
[1084.98 - 1088.34] strong they want to be fit all of us
[1086.84 - 1090.32] want to become Virat kohli's in our
[1088.34 - 1093.02] lives yes or no
[1090.32 - 1094.58] right so then would you take a fish oil
[1093.02 - 1096.50] supplement or would you take Natural
[1094.58 - 1098.54] fish now you know the vegetarians in the
[1096.50 - 1100.76] audience will say I'm vegetarian there's
[1098.54 - 1103.52] an answer for that there's vegan DHA
[1100.76 - 1106.04] also available extracted from CV because
[1103.52 - 1108.80] for your general knowledge the fish in
[1106.04 - 1111.02] the ocean eat the phytoplankton and the
[1108.80 - 1114.02] seaweed
[1111.02 - 1116.06] so the fish do not get omega-3 from them
[1114.02 - 1117.98] they get it from the ocean from the
[1116.06 - 1121.46] vegetarian sauce in the ocean now
[1117.98 - 1123.20] manufacturers manufacture vegan DHA so
[1121.46 - 1124.70] this was this was one of my favorite
[1123.20 - 1127.12] studies to share with the medical
[1124.70 - 1127.12] community
[1127.22 - 1132.80] DHA makes up the most amount of Omega-3
[1130.52 - 1136.04] in the brain
[1132.80 - 1140.06] now sixty percent of the brain is fat
[1136.04 - 1142.52] and when I when normally I meet doctors
[1140.06 - 1146.48] everyone says there's not enough of
[1142.52 - 1149.00] scientific data to prove that maybe
[1146.48 - 1151.28] omega-3 supplementation will help we
[1149.00 - 1154.58] need further studies
[1151.28 - 1156.14] I just have one thing to all the medical
[1154.58 - 1157.46] students
[1156.14 - 1160.82] think
[1157.46 - 1165.04] number one number two
[1160.82 - 1168.74] the world is now understanding the bio
[1165.04 - 1172.22] individuality of the human race
[1168.74 - 1175.40] I am gluten DNA sensitive
[1172.22 - 1177.74] my brother is not how do you explain
[1175.40 - 1179.24] that between two individuals in the same
[1177.74 - 1181.88] family
[1179.24 - 1183.68] so the bio individuality is going to
[1181.88 - 1186.80] make your medicine
[1183.68 - 1189.38] more personalized in the future
[1186.80 - 1193.28] so the perspective over here is if 60
[1189.38 - 1194.96] percent of the brain is made up of fat I
[1193.28 - 1197.50] have a thought to everybody in this
[1194.96 - 1197.50] Auditorium
[1197.74 - 1203.24] last year
[1199.94 - 1204.92] the government dropped the import Duty
[1203.24 - 1206.54] on palm oil
[1204.92 - 1209.12] do you know why
[1206.54 - 1211.94] there's a shortage of cooking oil in the
[1209.12 - 1213.14] country so prices cannot go up it's a
[1211.94 - 1216.26] correct move
[1213.14 - 1218.48] because the common am aadmi needs oil to
[1216.26 - 1221.06] cook and we cannot have expensive oil
[1218.48 - 1223.58] that you and I have in our kitchen
[1221.06 - 1226.46] but palm oil
[1223.58 - 1229.52] is saturated palmitic acid
[1226.46 - 1230.96] 60 of my brain is made up of
[1229.52 - 1233.00] fat
[1230.96 - 1235.52] what's happening to the dietary changes
[1233.00 - 1237.64] in our planet sorry in our country
[1235.52 - 1241.70] I'm only giving this as food of thought
[1237.64 - 1244.10] as a doctor please join the dots
[1241.70 - 1247.40] why is there more depression why is
[1244.10 - 1249.62] there more anxiety senior lecturers you
[1247.40 - 1252.86] and I never ate outside
[1249.62 - 1255.02] I got 10 Rupees pocket money
[1252.86 - 1258.02] do you remember the time we could not
[1255.02 - 1259.64] eat out eating out was once a month mama
[1258.02 - 1261.26] and papa took us out to such a happy
[1259.64 - 1263.54] thing today what's happening to you
[1261.26 - 1265.82] youngsters every meal is in a cafe
[1263.54 - 1267.20] coffee day Shanti Sagar this Sagar that
[1265.82 - 1269.48] Sagar
[1267.20 - 1273.38] sixty percent brain fat
[1269.48 - 1275.54] dietary source fat I rest my case
[1273.38 - 1278.36] I hope you all start eating a little
[1275.54 - 1280.76] healthier in yes I have seen
[1278.36 - 1283.52] personalized by individual cases which
[1280.76 - 1285.20] is why I make a shitload of money
[1283.52 - 1287.48] because people come to me and I'm not
[1285.20 - 1289.82] like there's not conclusive proof that
[1287.48 - 1291.32] omega-3 works you know what I think I
[1289.82 - 1294.02] need to use to eat fish oh I can't eat
[1291.32 - 1296.12] fish Ryan sir okay we're going to give
[1294.02 - 1297.02] you a vegan omega-3 how do I know it
[1296.12 - 1299.96] works
[1297.02 - 1303.50] there is a diagnostic test a fingerprint
[1299.96 - 1305.90] blood test I don't know if you know this
[1303.50 - 1307.94] I've been invited today by your hod of
[1305.90 - 1309.80] biochemistry so you better be good in
[1307.94 - 1312.68] Biochemistry
[1309.80 - 1315.38] the blood test test the omega-3 and
[1312.68 - 1318.68] omega-6 levels in your blood
[1315.38 - 1320.42] a simple 2400 rupee pinprint blood test
[1318.68 - 1323.86] which my prediction is in five years
[1320.42 - 1323.86] time it will be 50 rupees
[1324.56 - 1327.68] omega-6 to omega-3 omega-6 is
[1326.48 - 1330.20] inflammatory
[1327.68 - 1333.32] omega-3 is non-inflammatory
[1330.20 - 1335.36] right so if you come to know that a
[1333.32 - 1338.36] patient has a ratio the correct ratio is
[1335.36 - 1340.04] three is to one omega-6 is to omega-3 do
[1338.36 - 1342.86] you know when I did my test what was my
[1340.04 - 1346.88] ratio 33 is to one do you know what was
[1342.86 - 1348.02] my son's ratio 133 is to 1. and teachers
[1346.88 - 1350.66] were complaining he's not paying
[1348.02 - 1352.70] attention in school
[1350.66 - 1353.96] his brain his father big short
[1352.70 - 1355.82] nutritionist thinks he's feeding him
[1353.96 - 1357.32] correct but father is not there the
[1355.82 - 1358.94] whole day to see that what chips he's
[1357.32 - 1361.40] eating what junk food he's eating what
[1358.94 - 1363.26] servants are giving him
[1361.40 - 1366.56] and so then I was like open your mouth
[1363.26 - 1369.32] every morning fish oil give it to him in
[1366.56 - 1371.90] two weeks the teacher called me up Sir
[1369.32 - 1374.00] icon is an angel
[1371.90 - 1376.58] three months later tested it it's come
[1374.00 - 1382.28] down to 17 is to one
[1376.58 - 1385.28] the brain needs nutrition our diet is
[1382.28 - 1388.16] love and culture not scientific
[1385.28 - 1390.74] medicine is scientific diet is not
[1388.16 - 1393.08] scientific could you as doctors make
[1390.74 - 1395.60] diet scientific that is my sincere
[1393.08 - 1397.82] request to you so don't shoot down a
[1395.60 - 1399.62] nutritional supplement don't shoot down
[1397.82 - 1403.06] a molecule already found in the body
[1399.62 - 1403.06] which is DHA and EPA
[1403.34 - 1408.26] are things that can affect you do you
[1405.98 - 1411.02] know what is acrylamide
[1408.26 - 1413.66] microwave your food
[1411.02 - 1416.00] eat food that has been fired Beyond 180
[1413.66 - 1418.16] degree celsius a toxic chemical is
[1416.00 - 1420.98] produced from the carbohydrates
[1418.16 - 1423.82] right you know which one food has the
[1420.98 - 1423.82] highest acrylamide
[1426.14 - 1432.32] we all eat it even I love it it's long
[1428.96 - 1435.82] slim yeah french fries
[1432.32 - 1435.82] you're better off eating
[1436.24 - 1439.16] potatoes
[1437.78 - 1440.54] but the ones which are commercially
[1439.16 - 1443.00] fried they heat it at very high
[1440.54 - 1445.46] temperature so if you have an air fryer
[1443.00 - 1448.28] keep your airfryer under 160 degrees
[1445.46 - 1450.98] Celsius not above that refined carbs
[1448.28 - 1455.02] alcohol glycation fish High aspartame I
[1450.98 - 1455.02] will watching the internet on aspartame
[1456.14 - 1459.92] how many of you all know Aspartame is
[1458.06 - 1460.88] going to be banned by who raise your
[1459.92 - 1462.80] hand
[1460.88 - 1464.60] dudes you guys need to get in with the
[1462.80 - 1466.88] times
[1464.60 - 1468.80] I'm telling you something okay I'm going
[1466.88 - 1471.14] to share this frankly with you you may
[1468.80 - 1473.36] practice in a college today but
[1471.14 - 1475.88] artificial intelligence tomorrow will be
[1473.36 - 1477.80] given by Google and everyone to the rest
[1475.88 - 1479.66] of the world do you think patients are
[1477.80 - 1481.28] going to turn up to doctors then it's
[1479.66 - 1483.44] only when they're dying
[1481.28 - 1485.84] you want to enter the field of being
[1483.44 - 1489.20] aware about what molecules your patients
[1485.84 - 1490.82] put into their body so please get aware
[1489.20 - 1492.32] you don't have to go to the library and
[1490.82 - 1495.58] do this
[1492.32 - 1495.58] it's there on your phone
[1499.46 - 1504.68] so everyone I've given you my
[1501.92 - 1508.04] presentation as a scan so each one of
[1504.68 - 1509.60] these links are clickable okay so if you
[1508.04 - 1512.48] click on this I've given the scientific
[1509.60 - 1514.10] study on ginkgo biloba phosphorylcholine
[1512.48 - 1516.86] phosphate with city now let me share you
[1514.10 - 1520.54] with with you the Virat Kohli story
[1516.86 - 1520.54] actually not Virat Kohli somebody else
[1522.52 - 1525.98] phosphatidyls I have to remember now I'm
[1524.66 - 1527.72] not as good as you guys I think it's
[1525.98 - 1530.72] phosphatidyl serine
[1527.72 - 1533.12] 30 grams is the raw material source of
[1530.72 - 1535.76] phosphoryl serine in the brain
[1533.12 - 1537.98] right do you think a diet contains
[1535.76 - 1539.72] enough of phospholidated serine
[1537.98 - 1542.30] the four which is the foods which
[1539.72 - 1547.16] contain phosphoryl serine soy pumpkin
[1542.30 - 1549.44] seeds sunflower seeds and egg yolk
[1547.16 - 1552.02] average intake of 100 grams of the seeds
[1549.44 - 1554.00] provides 130 milligrams a day in your
[1552.02 - 1556.28] turnover rate as a medical college
[1554.00 - 1559.04] student or a professor sitting over here
[1556.28 - 1560.84] do you think you get enough of raw
[1559.04 - 1562.52] material source of phosphorylated serine
[1560.84 - 1565.52] and phosphorylcholine in your diet
[1562.52 - 1567.68] keeping in mind the farming practices in
[1565.52 - 1570.02] our country are chemically driven with
[1567.68 - 1571.40] pesticides and insecticides so organic
[1570.02 - 1572.84] is better but how many of us in this
[1571.40 - 1574.94] room eat organic
[1572.84 - 1576.68] my case in point to the medical
[1574.94 - 1580.76] community is
[1576.68 - 1583.90] look at the ingredients found in nature
[1580.76 - 1587.84] and in the human body and could you
[1583.90 - 1590.66] biohack individually the prescription to
[1587.84 - 1592.04] your patient using data whether the
[1590.66 - 1593.84] scientific studies are there on how it
[1592.04 - 1597.26] is so to give you in the cricket thing
[1593.84 - 1599.48] IPL you're playing playing there was a
[1597.26 - 1602.06] study on phosphatidylcholine levels in
[1599.48 - 1603.62] Boston marathon runners so they measure
[1602.06 - 1605.30] the Boston Marathon as Runners running
[1603.62 - 1607.90] running running immediately after the
[1605.30 - 1609.92] marathon there's a 40 drop in
[1607.90 - 1611.90] phosphatidylcholine levels then they ask
[1609.92 - 1613.82] them to do the brain games that Dr Jonas
[1611.90 - 1615.82] was talking about and they found out
[1613.82 - 1618.50] that the brain couldn't work
[1615.82 - 1620.18] phosphorylcholine levels went down I
[1618.50 - 1623.30] read this study and I was like hang on
[1620.18 - 1626.18] IPL that back back two days later
[1623.30 - 1631.04] another one bad bad so by the time five
[1626.18 - 1632.78] six games are gone the brain is 14th
[1631.04 - 1634.94] any of you medical students get brain
[1632.78 - 1636.62] fatigue
[1634.94 - 1638.96] you can't afford it
[1636.62 - 1641.18] but what if you could biohack your diet
[1638.96 - 1643.82] what if you could buy or hack your diet
[1641.18 - 1645.80] do not choose the wrong molecules and to
[1643.82 - 1647.78] find out where your phosphorylated
[1645.80 - 1649.46] choline and phosphorylating person by
[1647.78 - 1651.80] the way I'd be very interested to know
[1649.46 - 1654.14] if in India where testing in the blood
[1651.80 - 1655.70] chemistry for levels of phosphoridal
[1654.14 - 1657.26] selenium phosphorylcholine I don't know
[1655.70 - 1660.34] but I would love for someone to share
[1657.26 - 1660.34] with that me on Instagram
[1660.62 - 1666.20] um you've heard of Resveratrol
[1663.20 - 1667.58] right so people talked about you know
[1666.20 - 1668.96] this Mediterranean group of people
[1667.58 - 1670.70] Sicily and all they were drinking
[1668.96 - 1672.62] glasses of wine and you would have heard
[1670.70 - 1675.02] it and then your your friends and all
[1672.62 - 1677.54] hey Dr arment so we can drink three
[1675.02 - 1680.00] glasses of wine no and he's like but
[1677.54 - 1682.82] India we don't drink wine right but the
[1680.00 - 1684.50] study was done on Resveratrol in mice
[1682.82 - 1687.62] and they found it in anti-aging and
[1684.50 - 1689.90] stuff like that so for me
[1687.62 - 1693.26] where you talked about the Tau proteins
[1689.90 - 1696.50] and the beta amyloid as a nutritionist I
[1693.26 - 1698.84] only hear beta amyloid I know it is some
[1696.50 - 1701.06] garbage on the brain that is being
[1698.84 - 1703.94] formed okay
[1701.06 - 1706.22] Resveratrol in the study says it
[1703.94 - 1708.86] interferes with the formation of this
[1706.22 - 1710.00] ho as Ryan Fernando can I prescribe a
[1708.86 - 1712.58] glass of wine
[1710.00 - 1715.10] no no Dr Jonas will say you can't give
[1712.58 - 1717.94] alcohol alcohol shrinks the brain
[1715.10 - 1720.20] so what do we do who is the hero
[1717.94 - 1723.02] Resveratrol how do you think you can get
[1720.20 - 1725.24] Resveratrol grapes now the next problem
[1723.02 - 1726.68] is I start prescribing grapes
[1725.24 - 1728.66] people will start eating too much of
[1726.68 - 1731.06] grapes too much of sugar are we
[1728.66 - 1733.82] promoting a more fat gain diabetic
[1731.06 - 1735.56] version so nutritional supplementation
[1733.82 - 1737.30] with resveratrol
[1735.56 - 1740.12] have you heard of a Doctor by the name
[1737.30 - 1742.70] of Dr David Sinclair he's the father of
[1740.12 - 1746.84] uh claims to be the father of anti-aging
[1742.70 - 1748.64] Dr David Sinclair I follow him
[1746.84 - 1750.38] proof is in the pudding of watching his
[1748.64 - 1752.00] picture he's 53 years old he looks under
[1750.38 - 1753.56] 35 years of age
[1752.00 - 1756.14] so he's done the research on the
[1753.56 - 1758.90] Resveratrol and rats and all watch his
[1756.14 - 1760.52] online watch his online talks for two
[1758.90 - 1762.94] three hours you'll get information on
[1760.52 - 1766.22] respiratory by the way everyone I'm
[1762.94 - 1768.14] hyperlinked all the studies for you so
[1766.22 - 1770.36] the science part which I'm not really
[1768.14 - 1772.10] good at you can get it I read the
[1770.36 - 1774.80] science part and like how can I give
[1772.10 - 1777.56] this to Anushka Sharma if I give this to
[1774.80 - 1779.36] Anushka Sharma she will have good brain
[1777.56 - 1781.28] power to memorize her lines of the movie
[1779.36 - 1783.50] Yes because she came and asked me can I
[1781.28 - 1784.82] drink three two three glasses of wine or
[1783.50 - 1786.68] somebody else comes and asked me can I
[1784.82 - 1788.30] drink one everybody asks me
[1786.68 - 1789.56] but I don't want to give wine as a
[1788.30 - 1793.48] nutritionist I want to give respiratory
[1789.56 - 1793.48] so keep these points in your head
[1797.54 - 1802.22] so we all know that it's required for
[1799.82 - 1803.54] cognitive function brain development you
[1802.22 - 1805.16] are all speed readers are any medical
[1803.54 - 1807.26] college student can read very fast read
[1805.16 - 1808.88] fast again it's underlined because it's
[1807.26 - 1809.90] hyperlinked to the study that you want
[1808.88 - 1812.72] to discover
[1809.90 - 1815.78] I want to share few things anxiety and
[1812.72 - 1818.06] depression uh drug users they gave them
[1815.78 - 1820.46] three grams of Omega-3 and in three
[1818.06 - 1823.28] months there was a significant decrease
[1820.46 - 1825.20] in the symptoms study again if you see
[1823.28 - 1828.02] bottom here I've clicked for you to
[1825.20 - 1830.12] access the study and read it
[1828.02 - 1831.98] uh very interesting
[1830.12 - 1835.64] anxiety and depression is going through
[1831.98 - 1837.68] the roof across sometimes you know um
[1835.64 - 1840.14] you'll hear on the news so and so
[1837.68 - 1843.56] patient suffered from depression and
[1840.14 - 1845.48] committed suicide and all and sometimes
[1843.56 - 1847.34] I've got a very loose tongue so please
[1845.48 - 1848.78] forgive me for it so I'm reading a
[1847.34 - 1850.76] newspaper and I'm like looking and then
[1848.78 - 1852.56] I'm like look at my wife like yeah this
[1850.76 - 1854.48] fellow committed suicide vitamin B12
[1852.56 - 1856.16] deficiency omega-3 deficiency if you had
[1854.48 - 1857.24] taken this you would have been better my
[1856.16 - 1858.62] wife's like how can you be so
[1857.24 - 1860.60] insensitive
[1858.62 - 1862.16] but I would request you as a medical
[1860.60 - 1864.44] community when people are showing
[1862.16 - 1866.18] anxiety and depression just look at
[1864.44 - 1867.98] their diet
[1866.18 - 1869.90] look at their diet
[1867.98 - 1872.90] some of the solutions have become the
[1869.90 - 1874.94] Sherlock Holm prison study they did it
[1872.90 - 1877.64] to save costs to house a prisoner in
[1874.94 - 1880.04] Australia was nearly twenty thousand
[1877.64 - 1881.96] dollars per prisoner but the cost of
[1880.04 - 1882.92] Omega-3 supplementation was one thousand
[1881.96 - 1885.14] dollars
[1882.92 - 1887.84] they found out if they gave them omega-3
[1885.14 - 1890.36] supplementation they could use reduce
[1887.84 - 1893.06] the prison sentence because of good
[1890.36 - 1895.10] behavior because of the omega-3
[1893.06 - 1897.38] supplementation
[1895.10 - 1899.72] now people say it's not systematic peer
[1897.38 - 1901.52] review this review that review
[1899.72 - 1904.22] I'm like if my dad is going through
[1901.52 - 1906.50] depression and anxiety Papa
[1904.22 - 1910.16] omega-3 now I'm looking which is the
[1906.50 - 1911.48] best Omega-3 natural source right and
[1910.16 - 1912.86] the studies again are over here I'm
[1911.48 - 1914.90] going a little bit fast because I don't
[1912.86 - 1917.36] want to waste on the next scientific
[1914.90 - 1919.82] speakers time
[1917.36 - 1922.22] you don't remember me remember this
[1919.82 - 1925.04] slide for your medical practice
[1922.22 - 1928.04] please take down notes on this one hemp
[1925.04 - 1931.10] seeds one nut you you want to spend
[1928.04 - 1934.28] money on a great shirt
[1931.10 - 1937.46] buy a lesser shot so I spend more money
[1934.28 - 1940.28] on my diet and my trainers than the Emi
[1937.46 - 1942.26] for a luxury vehicle
[1940.28 - 1943.52] the human body is the most expensive
[1942.26 - 1945.92] real estate
[1943.52 - 1948.68] spend on your body and the nutrition so
[1945.92 - 1951.38] walnuts are expensive but research has
[1948.68 - 1954.94] shown the omega-3 contended walnuts is
[1951.38 - 1954.94] better than a fish oil capsule
[1955.22 - 1961.40] so you can get the 100 RDA from chia
[1959.12 - 1964.22] seeds hemp seeds I've forgotten to add
[1961.40 - 1966.88] one over here very famous in India under
[1964.22 - 1970.22] the name of methi
[1966.88 - 1971.66] flax seeds is amazing if your gut can
[1970.22 - 1973.64] tolerate it
[1971.66 - 1975.92] okay
[1973.64 - 1978.68] can so how many of y'all are
[1975.92 - 1980.06] non-vegetarian in this audience
[1978.68 - 1982.22] okay
[1980.06 - 1984.20] for the non-vegetarian audience
[1982.22 - 1987.10] can you tell me which fish has the
[1984.20 - 1987.10] highest Omega-3
[1987.92 - 1990.64] keep looking
[1995.68 - 2000.28] mackerel is known as a poor man's fish
[1998.02 - 2003.94] salmon is known as
[2000.28 - 2006.58] the VIP Superstars fish my father told
[2003.94 - 2008.68] me Ryan please do not publicize this on
[2006.58 - 2012.16] the internet in Goa you will make
[2008.68 - 2016.66] mackerel become the most expensive fish
[2012.16 - 2018.28] okay so I am asking you to look in your
[2016.66 - 2020.80] clinical practice tomorrow in your
[2018.28 - 2023.38] hospital if the possibility is not
[2020.80 - 2027.34] vegetarian can mackerel be one of the
[2023.38 - 2029.92] fish sources for it's like 100 grams of
[2027.34 - 2032.20] fish will give you nearly 10 grams of
[2029.92 - 2035.56] Omega-3 that's massive
[2032.20 - 2038.86] I have put people who have come to my
[2035.56 - 2041.38] clinic who are old and rich on the
[2038.86 - 2043.72] correct mackerel or salmon and in three
[2041.38 - 2045.94] months Elixir my skin is glowing my sex
[2043.72 - 2047.50] performance is better at 82. can you
[2045.94 - 2048.82] imagine an 82 year old telling you
[2047.50 - 2052.08] telling you his sex performance is
[2048.82 - 2052.08] better because of fish
[2053.86 - 2058.48] okay this is the this is the key slide
[2056.86 - 2060.12] which I would love to give you the the
[2058.48 - 2064.24] medical community
[2060.12 - 2065.86] uh I have linked every food with a
[2064.24 - 2068.92] scientific study
[2065.86 - 2070.36] um so can better can you just show the
[2068.92 - 2072.22] link of the study
[2070.36 - 2073.54] so for example pomegranates
[2072.22 - 2076.96] neuroprotective effects against
[2073.54 - 2079.96] Alzheimer's disease which are mediated
[2076.96 - 2083.50] by urolithins Euro lithons have been
[2079.96 - 2086.08] studied Now by doctors as the anti-aging
[2083.50 - 2089.26] molecule where do you get urolithins you
[2086.08 - 2094.32] are known to prescribe a drug 800 grams
[2089.26 - 2094.32] of pomegranate with the seed every day
[2094.84 - 2098.68] I know I'm being very passionate about
[2096.40 - 2102.10] this because
[2098.68 - 2103.66] the the medicine is in our food the
[2102.10 - 2106.18] medicine is enough food can you go back
[2103.66 - 2108.58] so all the secrets
[2106.18 - 2110.14] I am hoping somebody over here becomes a
[2108.58 - 2112.18] doctor of nutrition
[2110.14 - 2115.00] I sincerely do hope in the future you
[2112.18 - 2118.18] become a doctor of nutrition this is the
[2115.00 - 2120.88] key where I make a lot of money
[2118.18 - 2122.44] Dr Jonas this is my slide I want to wet
[2120.88 - 2124.54] it with you
[2122.44 - 2126.46] he'll give me more he will be give me
[2124.54 - 2129.22] more fuel to get it even better because
[2126.46 - 2130.54] when I have the clinical symptoms with a
[2129.22 - 2132.52] simple questionnaire or a blood test
[2130.54 - 2135.22] this is what we get
[2132.52 - 2137.74] this is the Indian RDA most of you know
[2135.22 - 2140.58] about the RDA which is the recommended
[2137.74 - 2140.58] dietary allowance
[2141.10 - 2145.54] I'm coming to the last slide I was
[2143.26 - 2147.46] supposed to do a neuroplastic exercise I
[2145.54 - 2149.14] don't think I'm an expert to do that but
[2147.46 - 2150.94] I was just looking up the internet and
[2149.14 - 2152.26] apparently you go one hand like this you
[2150.94 - 2154.18] go one hand like this can you do this
[2152.26 - 2156.40] with me
[2154.18 - 2158.92] so so one hand your one hand here okay
[2156.40 - 2160.06] interlock your fingers
[2158.92 - 2163.24] okay
[2160.06 - 2165.34] and then bring it in like this
[2163.24 - 2166.30] Now command your brain to move any one
[2165.34 - 2168.40] finger
[2166.30 - 2171.34] and see if you can make the free say oh
[2168.40 - 2174.34] man I can't move that finger have you
[2171.34 - 2177.28] noticed you're moving another finger
[2174.34 - 2181.20] your brain can be rewired
[2177.28 - 2181.20] your brain can be rewired
[2181.30 - 2184.80] so as medical doctors
[2185.14 - 2190.48] yeah as medical doctors you can learn a
[2188.56 - 2193.86] lot about everything that you do
[2190.48 - 2193.86] I'll take questions now
[2195.70 - 2200.32] my final slide
[2197.86 - 2202.80] you are what you eat
[2200.32 - 2202.80] right
[2203.08 - 2207.84] God bless you all and I hope you have a
[2204.88 - 2207.84] very successful career
[2213.52 - 2218.08] can you put the first Slide the first
[2216.34 - 2220.12] light
[2218.08 - 2223.02] no questions mean you are great students
[2220.12 - 2223.02] yes you have a question
[2226.06 - 2229.02] thank you
[2229.24 - 2233.10] what about the river fishes
[2235.42 - 2241.54] So based on my limited knowledge I am
[2238.78 - 2244.24] not able to I'm not able to find out a
[2241.54 - 2246.94] source of I'm not able to find out a
[2244.24 - 2250.00] source of river fish in any data saying
[2246.94 - 2253.42] how much of Omega-3 has and my logic
[2250.00 - 2256.30] says any fish that has omega-3
[2253.42 - 2258.58] or smells when you fry it
[2256.30 - 2260.38] so your salmon and natural which are sea
[2258.58 - 2262.42] fish smell more
[2260.38 - 2263.80] uh so beta I don't have an answer for
[2262.42 - 2265.30] you but if you can find it on the
[2263.80 - 2269.64] internet I have not been able to find
[2265.30 - 2269.64] the omega-3 content in river fish
[2271.48 - 2277.90] see I get this question about mercury
[2273.82 - 2280.42] poisoning beta we live in India
[2277.90 - 2283.06] it is heavy metal so how I solve this
[2280.42 - 2285.46] issue is as all the biochemistry
[2283.06 - 2287.98] students here know there is something
[2285.46 - 2289.00] known as the minerals heavy metal blood
[2287.98 - 2291.34] test
[2289.00 - 2292.78] all my very rich clients I subject them
[2291.34 - 2295.24] to that test
[2292.78 - 2298.66] in the history of my practice of 6000
[2295.24 - 2301.66] clients only one patient who lived in a
[2298.66 - 2304.42] mining area had high mercury levels
[2301.66 - 2306.70] so I I don't think I should go in the
[2304.42 - 2310.24] direction where literature is saying
[2306.70 - 2313.36] fish has heavy has mockery you can test
[2310.24 - 2315.16] for it if you are aware because now I'll
[2313.36 - 2317.92] put this in front of you
[2315.16 - 2321.52] you're supposed to take RDA for omega-3
[2317.92 - 2324.52] it can come via fish mackerel
[2321.52 - 2326.38] no no no don't eat mackerel it's got
[2324.52 - 2328.66] Mercury but you have not done the
[2326.38 - 2331.72] diagnostic test for mercury
[2328.66 - 2333.46] so with the assumption that your fish
[2331.72 - 2336.22] could be tender now I'll throw the
[2333.46 - 2338.56] question back to you as a medical doctor
[2336.22 - 2341.86] why are you prescribing a drug
[2338.56 - 2345.40] drug a side effect no you understand as
[2341.86 - 2347.86] a doctor the pros and the cons
[2345.40 - 2349.96] as a doctor as in so when you get into
[2347.86 - 2352.00] nutrition understand the pros of
[2349.96 - 2354.22] vegetarian sauce non-vegetarian social
[2352.00 - 2355.72] protein then what is the Omega in that
[2354.22 - 2359.04] and what is Omega naught in that that is
[2355.72 - 2359.04] how I look at it in my practice
[2359.32 - 2361.92] okay
[2362.20 - 2368.32] we can have electricity
[2364.68 - 2370.66] yes yes very very good answer so for
[2368.32 - 2373.60] those who are vegetarian vegan you get
[2370.66 - 2375.64] vegan omega-3 you can have chia seed you
[2373.60 - 2378.84] can have flax seed you can have hemp
[2375.64 - 2382.24] seed you can have Walnut and a lot of
[2378.84 - 2383.86] compounds in nature will have some tiny
[2382.24 - 2386.46] amount of Omega-3 which is why we say
[2383.86 - 2386.46] balanced diet
[2391.30 - 2394.30] just
[2394.84 - 2397.92] has a question
[2398.10 - 2404.32] I mean garlic we have seen that the the
[2402.52 - 2407.44] active compound that we look at is
[2404.32 - 2409.78] allicin found in garlic now Allison has
[2407.44 - 2412.30] got tremendous properties in terms of
[2409.78 - 2414.88] the Ros the free radical damage that
[2412.30 - 2418.12] happens so there are no individual
[2414.88 - 2421.48] papers with enough of data but when we
[2418.12 - 2422.50] give garlic atherosclerosis goes gets
[2421.48 - 2424.60] improved
[2422.50 - 2426.64] so if you've seen ancient ayurveda
[2424.60 - 2429.04] practice garlic has been part of the
[2426.64 - 2431.20] diet as a prescription what I recommend
[2429.04 - 2433.12] to people is when you take garlic you
[2431.20 - 2435.70] need to smash it you need to let it
[2433.12 - 2438.34] oxidize and then put it into your food
[2435.70 - 2440.26] the only side effect of garlic is more
[2438.34 - 2443.26] than two or three PODS of garlic a day
[2440.26 - 2445.42] for good microbiome for clearer arteries
[2443.26 - 2447.28] I don't have any scientific studies on
[2445.42 - 2449.62] brain and garlic or maybe I have not
[2447.28 - 2451.66] read it is that your sweat begins to
[2449.62 - 2453.10] smell after four weeks so that's the
[2451.66 - 2454.96] only side effect of garlic but yes
[2453.10 - 2456.52] garlic is also a blood thinner so it
[2454.96 - 2458.26] helps in that department
[2456.52 - 2460.92] any other questions otherwise can I hand
[2458.26 - 2460.92] it over yes doctor
[2467.68 - 2470.16] yes
[2470.38 - 2475.96] today and also do you approve synthetic
[2473.80 - 2477.64] proteins or synthetic supplements apart
[2475.96 - 2480.88] from all this but you learned that from
[2477.64 - 2482.98] the you know dietary allowance okay so
[2480.88 - 2484.72] so so doctor the the question the
[2482.98 - 2487.42] Doctor's first question is what is a
[2484.72 - 2489.36] balanced diet if you take the premise of
[2487.42 - 2492.28] a bio individual person
[2489.36 - 2494.80] genetically in nutrigenomics which is
[2492.28 - 2496.48] the science of studying how your food
[2494.80 - 2499.24] interacts with the genetics in the body
[2496.48 - 2501.04] there are certain people labeled to be
[2499.24 - 2503.50] better receptors for a higher protein
[2501.04 - 2505.00] diet and certain people with a higher
[2503.50 - 2507.18] carbohydrate diet will never put on
[2505.00 - 2509.26] weight so if I take the bio individual
[2507.18 - 2511.24] strategy that I use
[2509.26 - 2514.00] the balanced diet is different from
[2511.24 - 2516.34] person to person however assuming that
[2514.00 - 2518.20] we are in a teaching Medical College and
[2516.34 - 2520.54] the demographic of people coming in
[2518.20 - 2523.24] cannot do this bio individuality my
[2520.54 - 2524.62] advice is this our ancestors ate this
[2523.24 - 2527.68] much of rice
[2524.62 - 2530.26] this much of protein Dal pulses legumes
[2527.68 - 2532.66] and this much of subzi
[2530.26 - 2534.64] all people today have sedentary lives
[2532.66 - 2537.46] all including poor people
[2534.64 - 2539.52] so you need to turn the pyramid on its
[2537.46 - 2542.38] head sabzi needs to become this much
[2539.52 - 2546.28] pulses and Dal needs to become this much
[2542.38 - 2550.00] and green grain all the grain which is
[2546.28 - 2553.18] rice wheat jovar Bali Millet which was
[2550.00 - 2554.92] designed for manual labor so how many of
[2553.18 - 2556.78] us are doing manual labor we don't need
[2554.92 - 2558.94] that much of grain so we need this much
[2556.78 - 2562.00] of grain I think that is a balanced diet
[2558.94 - 2564.88] in today's day and age where the subzi
[2562.00 - 2568.24] and non-processed food goes higher and
[2564.88 - 2570.46] limit your patient to no more than two
[2568.24 - 2573.52] tablespoons of oil in the entire cooking
[2570.46 - 2575.62] in the day which in Indian cuisine is
[2573.52 - 2577.30] very difficult
[2575.62 - 2579.58] I had to change my housekeeping three
[2577.30 - 2581.58] times because of too much of oil oil in
[2579.58 - 2584.80] the in the dishes any other questions
[2581.58 - 2586.66] yes I just want to ask you what is your
[2584.80 - 2590.56] opinion
[2586.66 - 2593.08] open yes yeah so so sorry I forgot to
[2590.56 - 2596.26] answer Dr Erwin's question what is your
[2593.08 - 2598.30] stake on synthetic nutritional
[2596.26 - 2602.02] supplements which comes into from
[2598.30 - 2605.14] Herbalife as a nutritionist who worked
[2602.02 - 2609.28] for companies that sold these products
[2605.14 - 2612.10] they are good in the prescription format
[2609.28 - 2614.62] you should prescribe it nutritionist
[2612.10 - 2616.54] should prescribe it should not take it
[2614.62 - 2618.64] and just double it
[2616.54 - 2620.02] but for you to tell the person that
[2618.64 - 2621.46] there are no side effects or there are
[2620.02 - 2623.14] side effects will not work in today's
[2621.46 - 2625.48] day and age of Google
[2623.14 - 2626.98] all people are Googling it up people who
[2625.48 - 2628.18] come in my room with questions and from
[2626.98 - 2631.12] Google they are asking me questions
[2628.18 - 2633.34] trying to bowl dusra at me I can't play
[2631.12 - 2637.72] it to answer your question
[2633.34 - 2640.72] if the patient does not eat disciplined
[2637.72 - 2643.42] could a nutritional supplement be the
[2640.72 - 2646.90] nutritional convenience for the
[2643.42 - 2649.30] patient's nutritional in discipline then
[2646.90 - 2651.46] write a protein powder now Doc if you
[2649.30 - 2653.62] and I go to the gym and we know how to
[2651.46 - 2656.44] eat correctly a post workout meal which
[2653.62 - 2657.88] has 30 grams of protein I don't take a
[2656.44 - 2660.40] protein supplement
[2657.88 - 2663.46] but do I endorse a protein supplement to
[2660.40 - 2665.68] a sports player yes because he needs 30
[2663.46 - 2667.42] grams of protein which he doesn't have
[2665.68 - 2670.02] time to digest quickly enough because he
[2667.42 - 2673.36] has another training two hours later so
[2670.02 - 2676.42] technically needs micro nutrition my
[2673.36 - 2679.18] vitamins minerals protein powders are
[2676.42 - 2682.18] needed if you feel the macro of the diet
[2679.18 - 2684.04] is deficient so chiefly in poor people
[2682.18 - 2686.38] where the diet is predominantly
[2684.04 - 2688.60] carbohydrate and you have muscle wasting
[2686.38 - 2692.44] and other issues and disorders which
[2688.60 - 2693.88] need bodybuilding protein the ability to
[2692.44 - 2695.98] fortify
[2693.88 - 2698.56] with a synthetic nutritional supplement
[2695.98 - 2701.20] again synthetic is a little aggressive
[2698.56 - 2703.18] because for example whey protein process
[2701.20 - 2705.88] whey protein is coming from where from
[2703.18 - 2708.70] milk you separate casein and milk casein
[2705.88 - 2711.52] is paneer or it becomes casein powder or
[2708.70 - 2713.80] becomes a whey protein powder now the
[2711.52 - 2716.26] question is human race is not designed
[2713.80 - 2719.44] to take so much of concentrated protein
[2716.26 - 2722.14] without carbohydrate fat and fiber so
[2719.44 - 2724.60] what I do I make both the world's meat
[2722.14 - 2727.42] you take a protein powder take 10 grams
[2724.60 - 2729.94] if you're a normal person 10 grams mix
[2727.42 - 2731.68] it up with a vegetable juice why not a
[2729.94 - 2733.96] fruit juice
[2731.68 - 2736.56] occurred why not occur why not a fruit
[2733.96 - 2739.06] juice why vegetable juice
[2736.56 - 2740.38] awesome you guys are ready to draw in
[2739.06 - 2742.06] the world God bless you any more
[2740.38 - 2744.06] questions
[2742.06 - 2744.06] yes
[2747.78 - 2752.68] so if you read his autobiography if you
[2751.18 - 2754.74] read his autobiography he talks about
[2752.68 - 2757.24] this
[2754.74 - 2760.00] also was was the same when he came in
[2757.24 - 2763.24] for a nutrition consultation so a lot of
[2760.00 - 2765.34] people have what is ambidextrous right
[2763.24 - 2769.06] they're able to use both parts of of the
[2765.34 - 2771.52] thing I I think today's lecture
[2769.06 - 2772.36] my only takeaway and giveaway to you is
[2771.52 - 2774.76] this
[2772.36 - 2777.22] the human body is constructed from the
[2774.76 - 2778.48] raw material if you are reconstructing
[2777.22 - 2781.00] your house
[2778.48 - 2783.22] invest in the best possible materials
[2781.00 - 2787.54] for you and your patients and even those
[2783.22 - 2790.54] of you are teaching please expand into
[2787.54 - 2793.72] your classroom the idea that nutrition
[2790.54 - 2795.64] can play a therapeutic role to your
[2793.72 - 2796.99] medical practice God bless you all thank
[2795.64 - 2800.08] you for having me today
[2796.99 - 2800.08] [Applause]
[2804.54 - 2807.54] thank you
