Transcript: is your body the most expensive real estate if you are going to mistreat your own body which you can never replace so my thought process to people is you can control a lot of how you become based on the food you put into your body I also have this philosophies is today that as a human race we're eating more than we require problem with the human race is a lot of people for a long period in their own body behave as tenants the human race is eating too much today and we use food as a therapeutic bomb for stress you know so from that perspective I think uh we need to tell the gut boss there's a landlord in the body can we take control back again
