[61.64 - 67.04] a blood test every woman I meet in my
[64.72 - 69.52] counseling room I ask her to get a blood
[67.04 - 71.44] test done a standard blood test is
[69.52 - 74.32] beneficial which will have your vitamin
[71.44 - 77.00] B12 and vitamin D levels however if you
[74.32 - 79.32] want to up the game go for a complete
[77.00 - 82.92] vitamin and mineral profiling if you
[79.32 - 86.12] plan to do a hormonal Test please do it
[82.92 - 88.40] exactly 7 days after the first day of
[86.12 - 91.40] your menstration cycle this in my
[88.40 - 93.92] opinion will be done every year and you
[91.40 - 96.40] can compare your estrogen your
[93.92 - 99.00] progesterone your testosterone and your
[96.40 - 101.28] estradi levels along with the DHEA
[99.00 - 103.24] levels these are Advanced blood tests
[101.28 - 105.44] for women who want to keep their
[103.24 - 106.88] menstrual Health in check and know you
[105.44 - 109.08] don't need to do these blood tests when
[106.88 - 111.28] you're 40 years of age you can do them
[109.08 - 114.20] even when you're 18 years of age
[111.28 - 116.72] important make sure that your minerals
[114.20 - 119.20] specifically calcium and magnesium are
[116.72 - 121.32] not low so do this blood test if you
[119.20 - 124.12] need more information on how to get this
[121.32 - 126.24] blood test see the link descriptor Below
[124.12 - 128.48] in the comments and my team will help
[126.24 - 131.12] you arrange for that blood test my
[128.48 - 133.36] second tip to all the women that I love
[131.12 - 136.08] eat three fruits every day research has
[133.36 - 138.16] shown eat five servings of fruits and
[136.08 - 140.52] five servings of vegetables but to all
[138.16 - 143.04] the ladies out there I always say if I
[140.52 - 145.52] catch you on the road on the way to your
[143.04 - 147.80] office or on the way shopping if I look
[145.52 - 150.12] into your shopping bag I should see one
[147.80 - 152.32] apple carry a fruit peeler it's it's a
[150.12 - 153.84] great self-defense knife and you still
[152.32 - 155.52] can't get arrested because you're
[153.84 - 158.72] carrying a fruit peeler but the fruit
[155.52 - 161.28] peeler is for an apple a pear or an
[158.72 - 164.04] avocado that you can keep in your bag
[161.28 - 166.28] you see fruits represent the correct
[164.04 - 168.56] balance from nature in terms of sugar
[166.28 - 171.48] fruits also contain high amount of
[168.56 - 173.68] minerals you see we get sugar Cravings
[171.48 - 175.96] because of the micronutrient deficiency
[173.68 - 178.36] in our body so when you have these
[175.96 - 181.04] micronutrient deficiencies the body says
[178.36 - 184.48] from an ancient signaling point of view
[181.04 - 187.00] go and find foods that are salty or
[184.48 - 190.16] sweet and if you and I live 2,000 years
[187.00 - 192.48] ago the only salty or sweet Foods would
[190.16 - 195.44] come in the form of mineral salts from
[192.48 - 197.76] the rocks or the fruit hanging on trees
[195.44 - 199.96] so please make sure you eat three fruits
[197.76 - 202.84] a day point number three this is going
[199.96 - 205.76] to be a difficult one reduce your grains
[202.84 - 208.08] grains means things like rice wheat
[205.76 - 210.88] these grains were constructed in the
[208.08 - 213.40] agrarian society where women did a lot
[210.88 - 215.56] of Labor and hard work in today's
[213.40 - 217.92] desktop age where we are working on
[215.56 - 220.28] computers and sitting at offices and
[217.92 - 223.24] have cars and vehicles to fers around
[220.28 - 225.12] the place our entire energy expenditure
[223.24 - 227.60] is very low this is one of the main
[225.12 - 229.64] reasons why teenage girls are heavier
[227.60 - 232.12] and fatter we're putting too much of
[229.64 - 235.12] grain in their diet what I say to you
[232.12 - 237.72] our ancestors ate this much of rice this
[235.12 - 240.20] this much of Dal and this much of subzi
[237.72 - 242.28] what I suggest to you is learn this
[240.20 - 245.32] equation on the head eat this much of
[242.28 - 247.12] subzi eat This Much of Dal and eat only
[245.32 - 248.84] this much of grain because the whole
[247.12 - 251.88] perspective is grain is supposed to give
[248.84 - 253.60] you energy so reduce the portion and
[251.88 - 255.92] become aware what is the portion you do
[253.60 - 258.92] so by keeping a food diary you can over
[255.92 - 262.84] a period of 30 days slowly go from say
[258.92 - 265.36] 150 g of rice to 130 G of rice to 100 G
[262.84 - 267.44] of rice to 80 g of rice and before you
[265.36 - 269.16] know it maybe you're eating only 70 or
[267.44 - 270.76] 50 gam of rice and you're very happy
[269.16 - 273.20] with it because also your stomach
[270.76 - 275.28] shrinks in size my fourth point to all
[273.20 - 277.24] the women is you are in charge of the
[275.28 - 279.56] shopping in your house you are in charge
[277.24 - 281.36] of all the Staples purchases and food
[279.56 - 283.48] purchases in your house you see in
[281.36 - 286.60] today's day and age the farmers are
[283.48 - 288.76] using colossal amounts of insecticides
[286.60 - 291.72] and pesticides on the crop these
[288.76 - 294.20] chemicals play Havoc to your hormonal
[291.72 - 296.24] levels these chemicals affect your
[294.20 - 298.60] husband these chemicals affect your
[296.24 - 300.80] children so my suggestion to all the
[298.60 - 302.48] people who come to my nut Clinic is the
[300.80 - 304.96] first point is I don't want you to
[302.48 - 307.96] follow a diet before you follow a diet
[304.96 - 309.76] could you get purchasing on organic
[307.96 - 311.96] Point number five many of you may hate
[309.76 - 315.00] me for this point stop wearing your
[311.96 - 318.08] Cosmetics today's Cosmetics are loaded
[315.00 - 320.44] with hormone disruptors with chemicals
[318.08 - 322.68] that cause cancer they have beautiful
[320.44 - 325.48] smells and Beautiful Textures and they
[322.68 - 328.96] sold on smell and they're sold on touch
[325.48 - 332.36] feel and price I believe that our dadas
[328.96 - 334.72] had in icient Foods used as cosmetic on
[332.36 - 337.36] skins go back to those did you know that
[334.72 - 339.72] a lot of our Cosmetics are petroleum
[337.36 - 342.60] based petroleum meaning the fuel we put
[339.72 - 345.28] into our cars the byproduct of crude oil
[342.60 - 347.72] is that why could I not use coconut oil
[345.28 - 349.36] why could I not use beeswax many of
[347.72 - 351.32] these products there is no awareness
[349.36 - 354.00] therefore no demand and therefore not
[351.32 - 356.04] many producers or they're very expensive
[354.00 - 359.08] so whenever you choose your lipstick
[356.04 - 360.24] your eyeliner your mascara your creams
[359.08 - 362.20] make sure that they they do not have
[360.24 - 364.00] toxic Plastics they're not derived from
[362.20 - 365.60] crude oils and you know what if you look
[364.00 - 367.84] at the ingredients on your lipstick and
[365.60 - 369.96] cream you will realize half a dozen of
[367.84 - 372.48] them are chemicals so what should you do
[369.96 - 375.16] try and find people who manufacture
[372.48 - 378.64] creams and cosmetics organically and
[375.16 - 381.36] naturally Point number six staying with
[378.64 - 383.36] the chemicals many of us want beautiful
[381.36 - 385.44] smells in our house and the other day I
[383.36 - 387.68] was in a supermarket where somebody said
[385.44 - 390.20] sir we have these beautiful candles and
[387.68 - 394.64] it has lovely smells and what exotic
[390.20 - 397.32] names sunrise Orange and cinnamon Peach
[394.64 - 399.76] Apple blossoming I mean at the end of
[397.32 - 403.16] the day the words sound very appealing
[399.76 - 406.24] but I know that candles increase the
[403.16 - 408.96] volatile benzoic compounds in the air
[406.24 - 411.48] which affect your lungs women the lungs
[408.96 - 413.56] absorb a lot of pseudo estrogens so
[411.48 - 416.32] basically what we want to do is we want
[413.56 - 418.84] to avoid any sort of chemicals that are
[416.32 - 421.12] coming into the air think of candles as
[418.84 - 422.84] indoor pollution don't do them and if
[421.12 - 425.92] you want good smells in your house
[422.84 - 428.16] natural rhinds of oranges or lemons or P
[425.92 - 430.40] Puri which is old flowers that are
[428.16 - 432.44] dehydrated make sure no chemicals are
[430.40 - 434.48] added number seven you know me and my
[432.44 - 436.48] wife go shopping a lot of times and
[434.48 - 439.04] we're choosing more linen and cotton in
[436.48 - 442.08] our life the reason being is linen and
[439.04 - 444.48] cotton are natural Fabrics in your home
[442.08 - 446.88] your bed linen and the clothes that you
[444.48 - 450.04] wear as much as possible when you sleep
[446.88 - 453.12] try to switch to Pure cotton fabricc
[450.04 - 455.84] even the stitches in my cotton t-shirts
[453.12 - 457.76] and my wife's t-shirts are made with
[455.84 - 460.20] cotton thread so we're looking at it
[457.76 - 462.64] from organic perspective we're looking
[460.20 - 465.04] at it from a natural perspective
[462.64 - 468.04] research is showing that nylon and
[465.04 - 470.76] polyester based clothes have a hormonal
[468.04 - 472.84] impact have a cancer perspective on your
[470.76 - 475.96] body and therefore we steering clear of
[472.84 - 478.16] it I advise you to go natural in your
[475.96 - 480.68] fabric choices at least at home when you
[478.16 - 482.68] sleep for 8 hours and when you come back
[480.68 - 484.60] from Office take off all of your tight
[482.68 - 486.68] clothes that are constricting Your
[484.60 - 488.88] Health Point number eight this is common
[486.68 - 491.60] sense but buy the best water in the
[488.88 - 493.72] world and drink copious amounts of water
[491.60 - 496.68] you don't need beverages you don't need
[493.72 - 498.56] tea you don't need coffee you need good
[496.68 - 502.04] quality water don't wait till you're
[498.56 - 504.84] thirsty ensure you get 2 L of water as a
[502.04 - 506.88] woman every day 2 lit represent eight
[504.84 - 508.92] glasses of water when you get up first
[506.88 - 511.44] thing in the morning I recommend warmer
[508.92 - 513.12] water for a better bowel movement in
[511.44 - 515.28] case you're constipated don't worry
[513.12 - 517.16] about it you are not constipated
[515.28 - 519.16] research has shown that there are three
[517.16 - 521.04] types of people on the planet one who
[519.16 - 522.96] gets up in the morning and potties
[521.04 - 525.36] second who potties at any time of the
[522.96 - 527.04] day and third who potties at night don't
[525.36 - 528.68] believe that if your entire family
[527.04 - 529.92] parties in the morning and you poty at a
[528.68 - 532.24] different time of the day you're
[529.92 - 535.36] constipated as long as you get a bowel
[532.24 - 537.88] movement every 36 to 48 Hours you are
[535.36 - 540.00] not constipated ensure you drink more
[537.88 - 542.96] water so the stool that forms on your
[540.00 - 545.44] body is not dense and forms a plug
[542.96 - 546.80] additional water coupled with fiber
[545.44 - 548.92] which comes from your vegetables or
[546.80 - 552.00] fruit will help you have a better ball
[548.92 - 554.00] movement also your hormonal balance your
[552.00 - 555.88] blood chemistry balance your sweat
[554.00 - 558.04] production as well as your brain
[555.88 - 560.48] chemistry are all linked to better
[558.04 - 562.40] hydration Point number nine get an
[560.48 - 564.64] exercise wearable ring you know I've
[562.40 - 566.76] used the exercise trackers this gives
[564.64 - 569.16] you an indication of the number of steps
[566.76 - 571.20] the heart rate your stress levels I like
[569.16 - 574.08] the ring because it's non-invasive and I
[571.20 - 575.76] can even sleep with it at night you know
[574.08 - 577.92] the watch is invasive when I'm sleeping
[575.76 - 580.40] you know I turnover on my hand it hits
[577.92 - 582.64] my ear and it's quite uncomfortable but
[580.40 - 584.92] when it comes to the Rings they are
[582.64 - 587.12] giving me a perspective of incognito
[584.92 - 589.16] mode now how does a variable help you a
[587.12 - 592.04] variable helps every woman because I
[589.16 - 594.52] need every woman to get 12 to 15,000
[592.04 - 597.36] steps a day this ensures as you grow
[594.52 - 599.76] older and your estrogen is dropping your
[597.36 - 602.36] body will store more fat if you want to
[599.76 - 605.28] maintain your figure you want to be
[602.36 - 607.92] exercising low intensity exercise works
[605.28 - 609.76] better in wearing an exercise varable
[607.92 - 611.88] you will be able to see your heart rate
[609.76 - 614.92] during a workout your heart rate at a
[611.88 - 617.44] lower intensity like Jadu POA walking
[614.92 - 620.00] yoga Pilates weight training is where
[617.44 - 622.64] you will burn more fat so the exercise
[620.00 - 625.00] variable is a crystal ball gazing into
[622.64 - 627.52] being in the best zone for your
[625.00 - 629.80] exercises and here comes my final tip
[627.52 - 632.24] tip number 10 this is a tip actually not
[629.80 - 635.04] for the ladies but for all their better
[632.24 - 637.40] halves you see recently I had my wife
[635.04 - 638.80] get a breast cancer Gene test done you
[637.40 - 640.76] know when I practiced in the quanan
[638.80 - 642.52] clinics we've had so many cases where
[640.76 - 644.64] women are not able to conceive and they
[642.52 - 646.76] undergo fertility treatment in the
[644.64 - 648.48] fertility treatment they do not do the
[646.76 - 651.00] breast cancer Gene to check their risk
[648.48 - 653.28] element and sometimes by doing fertility
[651.00 - 655.84] treatment or eating the wrong diets or
[653.28 - 658.40] taking the wrong supplements we may
[655.84 - 660.68] inadvertently activate the breast cancer
[658.40 - 662.84] Gene in that person because they have a
[660.68 - 665.16] higher risk element now what happens is
[662.84 - 667.68] if you have a higher incident have no
