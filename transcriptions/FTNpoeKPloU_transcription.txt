[0.08 - 5.08] the help of a guru comes where you have
[2.36 - 7.12] to be pushed from the pranam kosha to
[5.08 - 9.12] the other dimensions forther around Vian
[7.12 - 10.68] kosha Anand mosha that a guru can do for
[9.12 - 12.92] you which is why having a guru in your
[10.68 - 15.04] life becomes important but any teacher
[12.92 - 17.04] Any teacher who's been trained who has
[15.04 - 19.28] some good intention for you can take you
[17.04 - 21.32] to pranam kosha once the pranam kosha or
[19.28 - 23.36] the energy body is activated you will
[21.32 - 25.36] see that its benefits permeate down to
[23.36 - 26.92] the mental body so your mind is great
[25.36 - 29.04] and the physical body which is why if
[26.92 - 30.76] you see a lot of yogis especially the
[29.04 - 32.44] ones who are living in the him malas or
[30.76 - 33.60] somewhere let's say in the forest they
[32.44 - 34.96] don't know what they're eating they
[33.60 - 36.56] don't know what they're drinking there
[34.96 - 38.12] are minor poisons coming into their food
[36.56 - 39.76] and water all the time but you see that
[38.12 - 41.60] they're in great physical health their
[39.76 - 43.16] sleep quarter is very Less in fact they
[41.60 - 44.92] don't even sleep there is a culture
[43.16 - 46.72] among so many yogis where they don't
[44.92 - 48.04] sleep at all because we say that sleep
[46.72 - 50.20] is a form of inertia and you want to
[48.04 - 52.04] reduce that to the best possible extent
[50.20 - 54.12] now they're not falling sick and the
[52.04 - 56.36] reason is that the pranam kosha or the
[54.12 - 58.96] energy body is fully activated and is in
[56.36 - 58.96] full flow
