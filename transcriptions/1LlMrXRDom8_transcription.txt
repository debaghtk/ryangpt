Title: cold showers

Description: Get in touch with me ðŸ‘‡ Cold showers offer a myriad of health benefits, making them more than just a bracing wake-up call. Beyond the initial shock, exposure to cold water triggers several physiological responses. It can improve circulation, enhancing blood flow to vital organs and extremities. Cold showers are known to invigorate the skin, promoting a healthy glow and potentially aiding conditions like acne. Additionally, they can boost the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells. Cold exposure may also contribute to better mood and mental resilience by activating the release of endorphins, the body's natural mood enhancers. Incorporating cold showers into your routine can provide a refreshing and energizing experience while offering numerous potential health perks.

[0.08 - 5.08] so cold water is where you fell into a
[2.24 - 8.28] stream you fell into the ocean and you
[5.08 - 10.88] got that reflex which uh kind of shocked
[8.28 - 14.00] you or awakened you so you're absolutely
[10.88 - 16.84] right that the nerve endings are in the
[14.00 - 19.56] front portion of the face and chiefly
[16.84 - 22.84] inside the mouth so from that
[19.56 - 25.64] perspective you can use an ice bowl to
[22.84 - 27.56] plunge your head into it uh and if you
[25.64 - 30.48] plunge your head into it uh it's the
[27.56 - 32.72] equivalent of activating the nerve
[30.48 - 34.76] endings which will give you the cold
[32.72 - 37.60] response for a person who just started
[34.76 - 40.60] cold showers just about 2 months ago the
[37.60 - 42.24] first 9 to 10 days are difficult and
[40.60 - 43.72] that's one secret that I will give
[42.24 - 46.16] everyone before you enter into cold
[43.72 - 49.00] shower take a glass of cold water and
[46.16 - 51.48] put the cold water in your mouth you
[49.00 - 53.16] acclimatize the shock response a little
[51.48 - 55.72] faster when you have to step into a cold
[53.16 - 55.72] shower
