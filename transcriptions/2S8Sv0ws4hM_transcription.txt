[0.04 - 3.84] your diabetes is not under control
[1.40 - 5.92] you're taking 14 or 15 tablets when we
[3.84 - 8.04] don't remember our meals when we don't
[5.92 - 12.20] have a food diary when we don't have a
[8.04 - 15.88] CGM we are eating to fulfill our belly
[12.20 - 18.68] needs not our biochemistry requirement
[15.88 - 21.76] oh mad one meal a day now this can only
[18.68 - 24.44] be done with Medical Nutrition Therapy
[21.76 - 27.12] 57% of these individuals remain
[24.44 - 29.81] undiagnosed which means diabetics is a
[27.12 - 34.52] silent killer
[29.81 - 36.76] [Music]
[34.52 - 39.12] so here are some quick tips to help you
[36.76 - 41.44] manage your diabetes one definitely
[39.12 - 43.44] increase your fiber intake adding more
[41.44 - 46.20] fiber in your diet is really effective
[43.44 - 48.48] in managing diabetes because the fiber
[46.20 - 50.68] slows down or it actually hugs the sugar
[48.48 - 53.64] in that food and doesn't prevent its
[50.68 - 56.72] Rapid Release into the blood the foods
[53.64 - 58.84] that you include with Rich fiber are
[56.72 - 61.24] vegetables fruits whole grains and
[58.84 - 63.44] legumes you knew this I knew this
[61.24 - 66.20] vegetables such as broccoli spinach
[63.44 - 68.32] carrots fruits like apple berries and
[66.20 - 71.00] pears are my favorite in the whole
[68.32 - 73.36] grains oats is known to lower blood
[71.00 - 76.04] sugar levels quinoa brown rice and
[73.36 - 77.80] legumes with things like beans lentils
[76.04 - 79.44] chickpeas chickpeas are amazing to
[77.80 - 81.60] contribute in terms of holding your
[79.44 - 84.80] sugar Spike and all of these have high
[81.60 - 86.80] fiber which significantly will improve
[84.80 - 88.44] your blood glucose levels and your
[86.80 - 90.72] overall Digestive Health if you don't
[88.44 - 92.88] believe me slap on a CGM and check it
[90.72 - 95.08] out when you take fiber in your diet and
[92.88 - 97.44] watch your sugar Spike come down another
[95.08 - 99.60] thing you can do is choose Whole Foods
[97.44 - 101.56] now what are these Whole Foods Whole
[99.60 - 104.16] Foods is basically you reduce the
[101.56 - 106.28] processed foods because Whole Foods is
[104.16 - 108.44] what comes in from nature and when you
[106.28 - 110.92] have more Whole Foods they're typically
[108.44 - 113.96] free from added sugar they're typically
[110.92 - 117.44] free from unhealthy fats and added
[113.96 - 120.00] artificial additives and all of these
[117.44 - 121.76] including your diet erated beverages
[120.00 - 123.48] have a significant impact on your blood
[121.76 - 125.36] sugar levels even if they're zero
[123.48 - 127.64] calorie because of these additives
[125.36 - 129.84] preservatives and all the junk in it so
[127.64 - 132.20] you can improve your health by opting
[129.84 - 134.52] for fresh produce whole grains lean
[132.20 - 136.84] proteins healthy fats and ensure they're
[134.52 - 139.40] not in a plastic packet or package
[136.84 - 141.64] because then it has the pitfall of being
[139.40 - 144.36] highly processed now another tip healthy
[141.64 - 146.52] fats into your diets this can also Aid
[144.36 - 149.92] in the management of diabetes Now the
[146.52 - 152.84] unsaturated fats such as avocado nuts
[149.92 - 155.44] seeds olive oil even coconut oil in my
[152.84 - 157.28] opinion do not only provide the
[155.44 - 159.24] essential fatty acids but they also
[157.28 - 161.32] known to improve heart health and reduce
[159.24 - 163.96] inflammation now I'm not saying take too
[161.32 - 165.60] much of fats I'm saying carefully
[163.96 - 168.44] balance with Medical Nutrition you need
[165.60 - 171.52] to avoid trans fat heated fats microwave
[168.44 - 174.08] fats fried fats commercially baked goods
[171.52 - 176.24] that limits the saturated fat which are
[174.08 - 178.52] processed in the form of cooking and
[176.24 - 180.88] these are sometimes also present in
[178.52 - 183.40] fatty cuts of meat and full fat dairy
[180.88 - 186.92] products in fact I recommend that you
[183.40 - 188.44] focus on incorporating fats that support
[186.92 - 190.40] your metabolic health and overall
[188.44 - 192.60] well-being this for me has been a
[190.40 - 193.84] challenging Topic in terms of fats
[192.60 - 195.32] because whenever people come to me in
[193.84 - 196.88] the nutrition clinic they say Ryan
[195.32 - 198.64] Fernando what fat do you recommend for
[196.88 - 200.92] me to eat as a diabetic and I scratch my
[198.64 - 203.12] head and I'm like but you know what I've
[200.92 - 205.40] not done your genetic test because
[203.12 - 207.96] different types of people like I respond
[205.40 - 209.80] to saturated fat which is coconut oil
[207.96 - 212.00] and butter and ghee but I'm allergic to
[209.80 - 214.16] butter and ghee so kind of after doing
[212.00 - 215.72] all the testing I know that I can use
[214.16 - 217.60] coconut oil I had another client
[215.72 - 219.44] yesterday coconut oil saturated fat was
[217.60 - 222.36] not good but mufa was good which is
[219.44 - 225.08] olive oil avocado oil groundnut oil so
[222.36 - 228.20] you see we are even bioindividual when
[225.08 - 230.12] it comes to our sugar levels so be
[228.20 - 232.60] cautious about adding fat just because
[230.12 - 234.76] I'm saying it in a video so work with a
[232.60 - 237.08] medical nutritionist to get your fat
[234.76 - 240.00] levels controlled at the right level
[237.08 - 242.00] final point this is common sense limit
[240.00 - 243.72] added sugars and this is vital for
[242.00 - 246.36] maintaining stable blood sugar levels I
[243.72 - 249.08] remember when I put the CGM on I had
[246.36 - 252.04] seen that my cup of coffee with 1
[249.08 - 255.76] teaspoon of sugar in it showed me a
[252.04 - 259.52] spike to 156 to 170 level then I had a
[255.76 - 262.76] cup of coffee without sugar in it and my
[259.52 - 265.72] level was at 110 then I did decaf coffee
[262.76 - 267.36] and my level was at 135 140 and then I
[265.72 - 270.28] did a little bit of research apparently
[267.36 - 272.32] caffeine also lowers sugar level but
[270.28 - 274.52] decaffeinated increases sugar level so
[272.32 - 277.32] it's very very interesting that the bio
[274.52 - 279.76] individuality was there so by telling my
[277.32 - 281.56] clients avoid beverages avoid sweets
[279.76 - 284.20] avoid processed food this is common
[281.56 - 286.52] sense the problem is does your tongue
[284.20 - 288.56] have common sense I don't think so the
[286.52 - 290.44] tongue doesn't have a brain your brain
[288.56 - 293.68] has brain cells which make executive
[290.44 - 297.56] decision but guess what your tongue is a
[293.68 - 300.24] slave to sugar salt and Umami flavor and
[297.56 - 301.92] a lot of these processed manufacturers
[300.24 - 304.44] add more amount of sugar I'll give you
[301.92 - 307.04] an example if I come to your house and I
[304.44 - 308.12] ask you for a glass of lassi oh Ryan
[307.04 - 311.08] Fernando's come I'll give him one
[308.12 - 312.48] teaspoon of sugar okay your friend comes
[311.08 - 314.96] you'll give him two teaspoons of sugar
[312.48 - 319.04] do you know commercial lassies have six
[314.96 - 322.16] teaspoons of sugar in them so understand
[319.04 - 324.00] it tastes good packaged food tastes good
[322.16 - 326.04] products in the market tastes good all
[324.00 - 328.40] of these juices and beverages taste good
[326.04 - 331.32] because they're adding sugar in it which
[328.40 - 333.68] you don't need so this is one thing that
[331.32 - 336.84] I need you to understand your taste bud
[333.68 - 339.56] is a slave to sugar and trust me even
[336.84 - 342.72] your brain cannot overcome it it has to
[339.56 - 344.80] be intentional it has to be counseled it
[342.72 - 347.64] has to be driven and unfortunately for a
[344.80 - 350.16] lot of people it only happens change
[347.64 - 351.96] only happens when you get the disease
[350.16 - 353.76] and then you're panicking and by the way
[351.96 - 355.88] at the beginning of the video I said 57%
[353.76 - 358.64] of people go undiagnosed if you have not
[355.88 - 360.88] done a blood test if you have not done a
[358.64 - 362.60] fasting glucose blood blood test then
[360.88 - 365.08] you can look at the link below in the
[362.60 - 368.00] descriptor and a list for blood test can
[365.08 - 369.52] be got from my website please do your
[368.00 - 371.52] blood test if you've never done you know
[369.52 - 374.40] what I found 16 and 18 year- old with
[371.52 - 379.44] pre-diabetic levels that is their hba1c
[374.40 - 380.96] levels at 5.7 5.9 6.1 6.2 and parents
[379.44 - 383.08] are shocked at this and they're like but
[380.96 - 385.04] the kids eating candy and sweets and
[383.08 - 387.36] chocolates all the time and when you go
[385.04 - 389.76] out you eat fast foods and cheaper fast
[387.36 - 392.56] foods with high carbohydrate content
[389.76 - 396.04] right from dosas to pizzas to Burgers to
[392.56 - 398.40] idys are all simple glycemic index High
[396.04 - 402.40] carbohydrate Foods causing the sugar
[398.40 - 405.24] diabetic pandemic of India so minimizing
[402.40 - 407.48] consumption of high sugar is what I am
[405.24 - 410.56] trying to convince you because this will
[407.48 - 413.20] prevent the daily spikes that happen on
[410.56 - 415.96] months days weeks years which then
[413.20 - 418.00] ultimately result in you getting blood
[415.96 - 420.52] sugar so what's the solution people say
[418.00 - 422.48] can I do sweetness why fruits yes you
[420.52 - 425.44] can can I do a natural sweetener like
[422.48 - 427.80] Stevia mon fruit yes you can but uh
[425.44 - 430.60] should I do like the chemical sweeteners
[427.80 - 433.60] the answer is no so whenever foods have
[430.60 - 435.24] as alamain sucros aspartame you know 100
[433.60 - 436.40] years from now 20 years from now I don't
[435.24 - 437.72] know when they're going to come back and
[436.40 - 440.16] say that these sweeteners are not good
[437.72 - 442.24] and even Stevia and Mong fruit we don't
[440.16 - 444.60] have enough of research on daily
[442.24 - 446.64] exposure of it so once in a away twice
[444.60 - 447.64] Thrice four times a month is okay but
[446.64 - 449.88] every day we don't know how your
[447.64 - 452.20] microbiome which is the gut back how
[449.88 - 454.44] does it react to sweetness so stick to
[452.20 - 457.24] what was found in nature which is honey
[454.44 - 459.44] and fruits as your sweet therapy I'm
[457.24 - 461.96] really happy you watch this far you know
[459.44 - 464.00] what a lot of people don't watch this
[461.96 - 466.36] far so here are my tips to you to help
[464.00 - 469.16] you out with managing diabetes or high
[466.36 - 470.68] sugar levels leafy greens get vegetable
[469.16 - 472.80] juices with spinach kale and other
[470.68 - 474.20] greens because they so low in carbs you
[472.80 - 476.60] can make a juice of it it'll fill up
[474.20 - 478.68] your stomach you get more antioxidants
[476.60 - 480.84] and make you glow and that's one
[478.68 - 483.24] starting point second is fatty fish
[480.84 - 486.28] salmon mackerel anchovy sardines high in
[483.24 - 489.00] omega-3 improve your diabetic levels my
[486.28 - 491.12] favorites are nuts and seeds you can
[489.00 - 494.24] manage your diabetic levels you can eat
[491.12 - 496.92] almonds walnuts chia seeds flax seeds
[494.24 - 499.24] pine nuts pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds
[496.92 - 500.48] these all provide healthy fats and fiber
[499.24 - 502.76] and they fill up your stomach so you're
[500.48 - 505.16] not going towards processed foods and in
[502.76 - 508.72] the legume family all your beans lentil
[505.16 - 510.56] chickpeas they're all high in fiber they
[508.72 - 512.56] have some amount of protein and the
[510.56 - 514.80] carbohydrate is the complex carbohydrate
[512.56 - 517.88] the thumbs up so here's an interesting
[514.80 - 519.72] one cinnamon and this is my secret okay
[517.88 - 521.28] so if you watched this far thank you so
[519.72 - 523.08] much for watching this far if you have
[521.28 - 525.04] not subscribed to my YouTube Channel
[523.08 - 527.52] Please Subscribe and I'll send you some
[525.04 - 530.00] cinnamon from my hand all right now why
[527.52 - 533.24] cinnamon dalini is known to have a
[530.00 - 535.96] bioactive compound called Cinnamon alide
[533.24 - 539.04] Now cinnamon aldhy goes in and captur
[535.96 - 541.72] sugar and boost the insulin to be more
[539.04 - 543.80] effective it's it's kind of like saying
[541.72 - 546.20] you know giving intelligence to your
[543.80 - 548.64] insulin to work a little better and
[546.20 - 550.48] giving more ly to your sugar to enter
[548.64 - 552.36] into the cells of the body rather than
[550.48 - 554.56] roaming around in the blood sleep so
[552.36 - 556.92] lowered blood sugar levels with cinnamon
[554.56 - 559.92] now how much I did an experiment I put a
[556.92 - 562.24] CGM I drank orange juice got 190 then I
[559.92 - 563.80] added qu teaspoon of cinnamon to the
[562.24 - 567.60] orange juice and my blood sugar level
[563.80 - 569.72] went up to 140 only so 190 140 there is
[567.60 - 571.44] a world of a difference now I'm saying
[569.72 - 572.92] that you can add cinnamon in your diet
[571.44 - 575.00] regularly there was a research paper
[572.92 - 578.48] which said it reduces abdominal obesity
[575.00 - 581.12] by 4% but that was 4.5 G of cinnamon a
[578.48 - 585.20] day now if you take 4.5 G cinnamon a day
[581.12 - 586.88] which I did I got severe acidity and um
[585.20 - 589.24] I think my stomach got affected and I
[586.88 - 591.08] got a mouth ulcer so caution caution
[589.24 - 592.64] caution please consult your doctor
[591.08 - 595.52] please consult your medical nutritionist
[592.64 - 597.40] for any advice anywhere that I give you
[595.52 - 599.60] please consult a medical expert because
[597.40 - 601.76] you are bioindividual anything you
[599.60 - 604.24] decide to do what Ryan Fernando or the
[601.76 - 606.08] Quan nutrition team gives out to you is
[604.24 - 608.68] common knowledge available of the
[606.08 - 611.92] internet in scientific research papers
[608.68 - 613.88] and by medical experts but when we apply
[611.92 - 615.56] this to you maybe cinnamon might not
[613.88 - 617.76] work for you so maybe you just want to
[615.56 - 619.80] do a pinch of cinnamon the next guy is
[617.76 - 622.04] also very interesting and your dadima
[619.80 - 623.92] and my dadima and everyone's dadima has
[622.04 - 625.68] given it to them no it's not armonds
[623.92 - 627.80] it's turmeric now turmeric contains
[625.68 - 629.68] something known as curcumin it has
[627.80 - 632.44] anti-inflammatory and blood sugar
[629.68 - 635.44] lowering properties so I actually tell
[632.44 - 638.16] my clients drink a turmeric latte have a
[635.44 - 639.80] pepper Rasam soup with turmeric in it
[638.16 - 642.44] when you're having your night healthy
[639.80 - 644.24] dud turmeric dud that is good in fact I
[642.44 - 646.36] make my chamomile tea with a pinch of
[644.24 - 648.20] turmeric because I want a little bit of
[646.36 - 649.92] cumin you don't need to take a
[648.20 - 653.04] supplement in this part of the world
[649.92 - 655.44] because we have enough of Healy in all
[653.04 - 657.04] our meals so if you're making omelette
[655.44 - 659.56] in the morning sprinkle a little bit of
[657.04 - 661.20] hethy on a f if you're having avocado on
[659.56 - 662.92] have a little bit of curcumin on it if
[661.20 - 664.80] you're having some noodles make sure
[662.92 - 667.12] that your taste maker contains some
[664.80 - 669.24] pinch of hethy in it that's a way with
[667.12 - 671.04] termeric can have its anti-cancer and
[669.24 - 672.48] blood sugar lowering effects don't take
[671.04 - 674.48] too much of turmeric it's a blood
[672.48 - 677.08] thinner and can affect your digestive
[674.48 - 679.28] health now the other one uh you know
[677.08 - 681.48] garlic to be famous do you know that
[679.28 - 683.76] garlic can also ward off and improve
[681.48 - 685.68] your glucose and lower the sugar levels
[683.76 - 688.16] so garlic is one of those compounds
[685.68 - 690.28] that's anti-aging as well as helping in
[688.16 - 691.96] Sugar control now you can put all of
[690.28 - 694.08] these together don't do any of these
[691.96 - 696.24] Foods in excesses but do them in
[694.08 - 698.56] moderation like how I need you to do
[696.24 - 700.68] your diet in moderation maybe you want a
[698.56 - 702.84] CGM a continuous glucose monitor to
[700.68 - 704.48] manage your levels but in addition to
[702.84 - 707.04] this I would like you to do some
[704.48 - 708.96] Lifestyle Changes also in my counseling
[707.04 - 712.40] room I always tell my people physical
[708.96 - 715.04] activity physical activity 150 minutes
[712.40 - 718.00] per week which is roughly about 30
[715.04 - 720.00] minutes a day for a 5day a week workout
[718.00 - 723.20] walking in my opinion is one of the best
[720.00 - 725.36] 7 days a week I also want you to include
[723.20 - 727.44] both aerobic exercises which is like
[725.36 - 729.28] walking but I also want you to include
[727.44 - 731.24] strength training because strength
[729.28 - 733.84] training builds muscle and when you do
[731.24 - 735.32] strength training insulin resistance
[733.84 - 737.36] comes down which means your insulin
[735.32 - 739.76] Sensi improves which means your sugar
[737.36 - 742.04] management gets good then I can't talk
[739.76 - 745.12] about weight weight weight weight weight
[742.04 - 747.40] not weight as in weight but vajan
[745.12 - 749.28] everybody in India has a higher BMI
[747.40 - 752.00] nowadays we're eating too much and
[749.28 - 754.80] moving lesser I want you to have a BMI
[752.00 - 757.76] of no more than 21 this is the perfect
[754.80 - 760.08] BMI if your BMI is 33 boss you need to

[760.08 - 765.04] to wake up if your BMI is 22 you still
[763.00 - 767.32] need to wake up because ultimately as

[808.96 - 814.20] with with my yoga and meditation Guru
[810.84 - 816.28] for 30 minutes to lower my stress levels
[814.20 - 819.88] simple tip to lower your stress levels
[816.28 - 819.88] do four shallow
[823.92 - 827.80] breaths and one long
[828.08 - 832.60] breath and side this is what was taught
[830.48 - 834.76] to me by my yoga guy it activates your
[832.60 - 836.56] parasympathetic nervous system reduces
[834.76 - 838.44] stress if you reduce your stress you
[836.56 - 840.48] don't have constant sugar spikes when
[838.44 - 843.16] you eat so lowering your stress is
[840.48 - 845.64] really good but now the final point I'm
[843.16 - 847.64] coming to is adequate sleep I have found
[845.64 - 850.56] that I've been successful with every
[847.64 - 853.44] superstar and athlete and why I found
[850.56 - 857.40] out they Kryptonite I found out the accy
[853.44 - 860.24] heal I found out they PTI the punati is
[857.40 - 863.84] this they are not getting more than 6 to
[860.24 - 866.20] 7 hours of sleep I need people to get 7
[863.84 - 868.32] to 9 hours of sleep last night I slept 7
[866.20 - 870.16] hours 40 minutes in this entire month I
[868.32 - 873.12] can tell you EX exactly how much sleep I
[870.16 - 876.44] got you know what's my target 30 into 8
[873.12 - 878.96] hours per day 240 hours of sleep per
[876.44 - 882.60] month is my Target and many of times I
[878.96 - 886.16] get only 200 hours and that's where our
[882.60 - 888.84] disease starts sleep is a non-negotiable
[886.16 - 891.08] component of your life the more you get
[888.84 - 893.56] of sleep the more accurate your sleep
[891.08 - 896.00] trust me your DNA is better your
[893.56 - 899.32] hormonal diseases are not there your
[896.00 - 902.00] aging is lesser and therefore I I need
[899.32 - 904.88] to tell you that sleep in my book is the
[902.00 - 906.56] new diet now final point I need you to
[904.88 - 908.44] do regular monitoring if you come from a
[906.56 - 909.76] family history of diabetes or have
[908.44 - 911.72] already tracked your blood sugar and
[909.76 - 914.08] it's higher you look at your blood sugar
[911.72 - 916.76] levels post pandal that's after meal
[914.08 - 919.36] hb1c look at your blood pressure look at
[916.76 - 921.88] all your cholesterol and I need you to
[919.36 - 925.40] pay attention to this bonus tip the
[921.88 - 928.56] bonus tip is that your diabetes is what
[925.40 - 930.56] is causing your heart attacks you see in
[928.56 - 932.96] LD cholesterol which is the bad
[930.56 - 936.96] cholesterol there is a protein called
[932.96 - 939.80] D100 D100 protects LDL and makes this
[936.96 - 942.08] Seda Sada bad cholesterol behave itself
[939.80 - 944.32] in the blood but the moment you start
[942.08 - 946.96] having higher sugar level this sugar
[944.32 - 949.04] goes and slaps D100 protein and tells
[946.96 - 950.96] him by don't give any protection to LDL
[949.04 - 953.40] cholesterol I want to go and punch LDL
[950.96 - 955.16] cholesterol and make it sticky so that
[953.40 - 958.00] is how your LDL cholesterol becomes
[955.16 - 961.44] sticky and forms block so the culprit is
[958.00 - 963.80] high blood sugar levels slapping D100
[961.44 - 966.48] causing your cholesterol to misbehave
[963.80 - 968.08] and that misbehavior might suddenly
[966.48 - 969.88] cause you to have an heart attack you
[968.08 - 972.28] see you don't die from high blood sugar
[969.88 - 974.40] level you die from related conditions
[972.28 - 977.52] where sugar is the culprit which is why
[974.40 - 980.88] I can't emphasize how important is it
[977.52 - 983.00] for you not to get high sugar in your
[980.88 - 984.88] life get high on life don't get high on

[1003.84 - 1009.24] another secret how you eat in serial
[1007.08 - 1011.68] order your food in a meal is so
[1009.24 - 1015.04] important it's called the timing inside
[1011.68 - 1017.96] the meal and I say that first you have
[1015.04 - 1020.08] your fiber so you know I come from Goa
[1017.96 - 1021.40] and uh my father tamilan and my mother
[1020.08 - 1024.28] is Goan and we have the Portuguese
[1021.40 - 1027.68] culture at Gua where we actually first
[1024.28 - 1029.68] have a piece of vegetable like a salad
[1027.68 - 1032.20] then we do a soup and then we have a
[1029.68 - 1034.64] Beal and I never understood that but
[1032.20 - 1036.60] when I read the glucose goddess and she
[1034.64 - 1038.28] talked about it as a biochemist I'm a
[1036.60 - 1041.48] biochemist she's a biochemist I'm like
[1038.28 - 1044.32] damn we've been doing this for centuries
[1041.48 - 1047.84] first we ate fiber so it first have your
[1044.32 - 1050.04] salad or your soup lots of fiber then do
[1047.84 - 1052.76] your protein which is your dlls your
[1050.04 - 1055.44] paneer your non wage then do your
[1052.76 - 1057.12] carbohydrates which is your rice or Ry
[1055.44 - 1058.08] and leave your dessert for last and this
[1057.12 - 1061.36] is my
[1058.08 - 1064.40] solution after you finish your dinner or
[1061.36 - 1066.24] your lunch go for a 10-minute walk as
[1064.40 - 1068.40] soon as you come back from a walk have

[1068.40 - 1071.88] phone and call your loved one whilst
[1070.04 - 1074.48] you're having that dessert I found this
[1071.88 - 1076.44] out by putting the CGM on my shoulder
[1074.48 - 1079.04] and then I found out that hey this is a
[1076.44 - 1080.88] great way for me to control a sugar
