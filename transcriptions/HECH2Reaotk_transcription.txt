Transcript: like how I go to the gym and train my bicep could I train my stomach muscles or by leaing Good Foot whichin P fiber the most common cause of constipation is lack of fiber inic okay and also lack of water the most common cause of bloating is constipation was there ever a case where you just told a person drink more water and it cured them welcome to the office of cut and but Dr Paul manikum a gastroenterologist Health educator and a content creator with over 2 million subscribers on YouTube he talks about gut health time restricted feeding and mostly pl-based diet and his passion for health extends Beyond his practices and social following he's also the creator of medcom a standard comedy show that combines his sense of humor with his background in medicine we welcome Dr pal manikum who will bust all of the gut health myths first time ever on healthshot podcast [Music] how you finding India this time around super wonderful always good to be in India always good to pleasure to car with you I was just so excited when I realized that Christmas time that you coming into India so I was like I told my team let's meet Dr Paul because you know what here's a gastro doctor surgeon who tells people fast and eat less so my kind of guy so it's going to be like funny for me to ask you questions and our followers confuse us for each other anyways anyways so I said let's open it up to them super and what are the questions that your followers or my followers had from the gastro which is the gut Department correct so a quick fire of about 15 20 Questions doctor's really busy is giving in is surgery time to us so we really get cracking okay so first question somebody asked me I always face constipation and bloating though I'm a vegetarian so the assumption is vegetarians are holier than thou and I always face constipation and bloating though I'm a vegetarian meaning what vegetarian is Untouchable in the gut system and I eat out once in a while so first things Dr Paul constipation what is it and bloating what is it and vegetarians also get her T part okay so uh the most common cause of constipation is lack of fiber intake okay okay and also lack of water intake usually what we tell my patients whenever the patients coming in constipation is the first thing is increase your water intake to minimum 2 L of water per day and then increase your fiber big time at least 25 G of fiber per day and that's a lot until you consciously include it you are not going to get it uh based on the current uh eating habits and then the most common cause of bloating is constipation because the poop is held back in the gut usually you know uh there disregulation of the brain gut axis and there's a development of bad gut bacteria in we call this as sometimes chronic idiopathic constipation or irritable bubble syndrome of constipation but regardless there is this disbiosis where there is brain C axis is disregulated I know talking medical options speaking of medical options was there ever a case where you just told a person drink more water and it cured them to be honest that is the treatment but people think that I need to give the medications only then they will be reassured okay good this is a good doctor and obviously you know we recommend people to drink water as a doctor how do you prescribe water uh is there a magical uh way that you do it or anything like that yeah yes I do I do so you know even my personality and also my education is usually not theoretical so I always do practical uh ways to trips and my patient so we calculate eight glasses of water per day so I tell them to drink one glass before meals and one glass after meal breakfast lunch dinner six glasses and then one glass 10:00 a.m. morning snack and then P p.m. snack you're all done awesome advice staying with the same thing one of our followers asked us can dehydration lack of water cause stomach cramps oh yes you know uh so see in my channel as well always have been promoting hormonal balance correct circadian rhythm and there are only like few major important hormones that we need to be really considerate one is the you know insulin melatonin cortisol um three major hormon that I absolutely worship and love and everybody should love and worship as well so these hormones love water ah so you know when you give water they just like they're having a party out there they're not grumpy ah they're basically swimming in the pool um so basically you increase the quality of these hormones by providing them water for the uninitiated to stomach cramp what would be the easiest way we could describe what is stomach cramping uh stomach because females say like I got cramps right and then here somebody's talking about a gut cramp correct and then verat kohi gets a calf cramp so as a doctor can you kind of give us like a man opinion of is it a knife poking us or somebody socking you in the gut what is it like so cramps itself is a muscular contraction correct where it happens in cal It's skeletal muscle contraction when it happens in the gut it's smooth muscle contraction oh we have muscles in the gut gut is nothing but muscle as well so could I train that like a gym training uh like you know how I go to the gym and train my bicep could I train my stomach muscles also by eating good food which and P fiber that is the exercise of the stomach oh so that's the exercise of stomach eat correctly eat correctly and not do this in the kitchen so no stomach crunches as doctor says U and speaking further we're going to talk only about B our followers one somebody asked us is syum husk or what we call in India as isab Gul good for gut bacteria can I consume it every day so selum mask is a wonderful option we also um give it to all my patients in uh us as well it comes with a brand called matam musil um the idea behind that is as we talked about fiber is absolutely critical for the gut uh in our modern days era we don't get enough fiber so we add this fiber supplements but the problem is we need to add it very slowly because every individual is different so sometimes fiber can precipitate abdominal bloating so most of the times what happens is I take as them to take  mask they take one day and then they get bloated and they like you know this doctor is not good let's go to a different doctor oh so you should talk very very slowly sometimes you might be able to even take two to three capsules that you'll be surprised sometimes you'll be able to eat only one or even better is forget about celum Basque and just take fiber through natural sources until you reach 25 G of fiber per day minimum so 25 G of fiber is the key thing try and find it from natural sources I think the human race wants more convenience of a powder or pill and they're not willing to go back and check what are the foods which have fiber and how can I take that at my daily correct but uh but you know it's a long process even I myself didn't know what was the fiber content in multiple food ingredients so educating Yourself by seeing Ryan's channel in terms of how much fiber is there in every ingredient uh slowly and steadily what happens is that even without your knowledge you will start incorporating all these ingredients so you do a lot of colonoscopies and endoscopy so you put a camera in and you check people's guts both from top down and bottom up up correct when people eat really good or have good fiber are you as a doctor able to see a good gut and a bad gut absolutely yes so when we put a camera down we can see how inflamed how angry the stomach is you can see that yeah absolutely when we put a camera down so that means people because they can't see something they're not able to link that they are slapping their gut correct but they slapping it inside ah so that's the dangerous part so it's too late sometimes before they come to you and not too late uh I mean to a point that yes regarding terms of symptoms yes you know it's too late that what are the symptoms we should look for like what are the symptoms I should look at or our follower should look for so that we don't have to put a camera down our throat or up a butt so uh there are two parts to that okay so the up your butt is colonoscopies yes and I do that when patients don't have any symptoms at all ah okay expand please doctor so it's a screening procedure why should we do screening so in United States when you turn 50 the medical insurance pays me to do the colonoscopies on every patient and what are we looking for we're looking for growths inside the colon we call it as colon polyps what are these polyps these are like similar to skin growths it can grow inside the colon based on your genetic predisposition what you are eating lack of fiber lack of physical activity obesity all these are risk factors for formation of these precancerous colon polyps and these screenings that you do doctor on these 50 plus people have you found people who you have saved their lives absolutely I mean this is my date I'm a superhero on a daily basis wow wow wow so sticking with the gut and I'm going to come back to this colonoscopy and endoscopy uh I think in a lot we got like about 25 or 30% of people asking this one question which is Doctor what are the remedies for acid reflux so my first question to you what is acid reflux and then who are the guys who are going to save us okay acid reflex is basically reflex of the stomach acid back into the esophagus reflex means what it comes back H regurgitation basically it comes back basically the acid should be in the stomach alone but unfortunately something has happened where the spinter muscle there is a muscle at the end of the junction of the foot pipe and the stomach it is supposed to close it's like a gate it's a gate it's a door so if that doesn't close properly the acid comes back so when you eat food goes inside the stomach the acid is secreted by the stomach and it gets broken down into small pieces correct and then the lots of acid is being secreted because we heat it not so what happens is if this if this door the door closes as soon as the stomach the foot goes into the stomach but if the door is open because acid is secreted acid comes back into this sagus awesome there's a funny question we got from one of our followers okay my stomach speaking like in third person my stomach not me my stomach is not digesting gee or fried foods if I eat those Foods I pass tools with mucus and I get lose motions what should we answer to such a follower so um maybe he's very sensitive to those foots correct but isn't it common sense you eat eat something it's going to slap you you should avoid it uh so there are two parts to it one is if you eat more yes that is the so you mean to say that sometimes we can fly under the radar by eating lesser of that correct correct exactly so first thing to this person is that you need to decrease the fried fatty foods whenever whatever he is eating but let's say that he still has the problem even after decreasing it that is where we say that your stomach is very sensitive we need to fine tune your stomach handhold your stomach and love your stomach com back for those who are uninitiated but follow you and follow me what is the meaning of mucus in stoes so mucus is the intestinal lining secretes some fluid it's like a sticky when you blow your nose that does it look like that mucus when you blow your nose is it a clear white mucus or is it like when you get a cold which is green mucus so it's usually ELO mucus and then you know we see that while we are doing the procedure colonoscopy so if I poty and I look down I should technically not see mucus with my stool and generally not yes generally not and if I see a lot of mucus it could be a sign of an problem it could be a simple problem like you know irritable bubble syndrome or something like that or it could be a uh relatively more uh um you know complex problem like inflammatory bubble disease like rones disease or altic colitis when you were in Medical College were you given stool samples to look at and see what is mucus and what is without mucus and I absolutely loved it I got a gut feeling you want to really enjoy your profession for the rest of your life absolutely okay so the reason I'm asking these questions is because uh you know oh one one thing it's most more than mucus the most important thing is blood oh we shouldn't see blood right Whenever there is there are two types of blood right fresh blood and old blood or something like that can you tell us about that yeah so more than mucus blood and stool is considered as a red flag so fresh blood would look like red blood huh so blood tool is could be bright red yes what what is that problem like most likely it is hemorrhoids you got to understand that we can get skin problems inside our gastrointestinal system and it could bleed yeah yeah so what if I bleed in the stomach then the color of my stool changes to Black so if I look at black and and when we talking about black what is black like this black like my hair like the mic black no my I don't have hair but still if you have or this might black it turns that black very dark so normally stool is brown in color light brown dark brown the reason that it is black is if there is a bleeding in the stomach the acid digests the blood which is red in color that turns into black and Cals down the intestine so those of you who got a black tongue and black stool see Dr pal immediately no see a good doctor locally as well we don't need to wait for him to fly down to America but these are things that people actually never discuss at the dining table or in families like I would share something very intimate with you and the followers around 10 years ago I had hemorrhoids and uh it was one and um you know I took a lot of termeric supplement and lot of Omega and lot of protein powder no fiber and I guess I started getting blood in my stools so I kind of got it treated uh with the rubber band kind of thing and it the doctor explains it's a very harmless procedure and got it done very interesting is why am I telling everyone about this is when I went to my mom and I said I'm going in for a medical procedure which is very simple and I'd be out in 2 hours she said I also have hemorrhoids like okay uh your grandfather also had it and then I was like what about your brothers and sisters I never asked them so I picked up the phone and started calling all my uncle and aunties and Chacha and chachis and everything and guess what Dr pal everybody everybody had it andone was silent about it so is it true that people don't discuss their bowel M and gut problems and it's it's a very like a taboo topic yeah absolutely and that's why I combine humor into this very Tabo topic what's your biggest what's your biggest joke to to a patient on the table I said welcome to the office of gut and butt gut and butt almost like beis and butt head now we have a lot of people who followers who will be pooping every day and be eating every day and mostly they come to me because they eat wrong and there's one problem I can't solve in eating is when people live in pgs being guest and hostels and that's most of struggling India Today people who watch us who building their careers and all and they want to work late nights and all and they're saying that how do I control gastric if I stay in pgs and hotels because they add baking soda to food so you know there are some modifiable factors and there are some non-m modif like what what secret agent can we take to protect us that's what I'm saying so there's modifiable factors and then non-modifiable factors non-modifiable factors it looks like in this person where they are giving baking soda in the mess and he doesn't have any other option to modify that um best case scenario is stop it but as a medical doctor do you think baking soda does a KU or irritate your gun it completely depends upon the individual it's bioindividual it it also also it's like I I can't stand coffee it irritates my gut correct but for somebody else coffee is amazing I'll tell you an example for research wise they said that coffee chocolate citrus fruits have aggravated the acid exposure because it increases the acidity so before 5 years 10 years before we used to tell all patients when coming into the offic Stop chocolate stop coffee stop but the patient is telling me that when I eat chocolate it is nothing is happening to me I'm okay but when I drink tea yes that is happening there's a bio individuality the same way when I told recently somebody have guava to to increase of vitamin C this say I got a throat infection and I get cold and I actually saw this in a few of my clients that there's a biod digity so no one size fits all in food correct yeah does the same hold true for medicines yeah so that's why when we talked about the husk some patients may be able to tolerate it some I had a patient who got celum Mas constipation it could he's like I just can't touch it I couldn't poop for two days so I don't know what happened to that musk in his gut but you know the baking soda option um is there anything we can do to counter it um so what I tell my patients is whenever there's a nonm modifiable risk factor where you really absolutely love this baking soda it's okay but see whether you're able to check all the other risk factors that you can modify like sleeping properly eating all right at the other times and all those things okay simple Dr paling go to the nutritionist so risk for fatty liver and how it can be reversed now does the liver come in the gastro Department yes that's what it's called gastroenterology and hepatology hepatology is liver ah so I learned something today so doctor is also a hepatologist oh uh hepatology so there is one more year of Fellowship where people do just liver alone and in the entire human body let's say you are not a gastro or a herat according to you which is the most important system gut the gut even if I'm not a gastro I'm going to say gut yeah you know there's a joke that somebody said that you know all the organs had a had a meeting at a discoe and everyone was posturing that I'm the best in Dr Paul's body Brin says I'm number one the nose said I'm number one The Heart said I'm number one everybody said number one and then when the when the anus spinter muscle said I'm number one everyone laughed at the at the spinter so the said okay you guys are laughing he decided he decided to shut up everyone by stop working for 3 days all the system shut down or open up but inappropriate circumstan that's even worse that's even worse in my gastro control they say that the most important function that any other organ cannot do is use anal spinter muscle that anal spinter muscle to work properly there is so many things that has to go right and and correct me if I'm wrong if people have a lot of stress your anal spinter muscle goes for a to absolutely that's why you see this you know feal incontinence where they're not able able to hold the stool and they have leakage yeah that happens mainly mostly in neurological patients that's why they say there's a gut brain axis right okay we'll talk about that a little bit further uh but we talking about risk for fatty liver and how it can be reversed what's your take to people so fatty liver we see that every day on a daily basis two main risk factors one is alcohol and the other one is obesity but the problem is we drink alcohol and we eat Biryani as a side dish ah so there are three bees that goes for fatty liver one is biryani beer and belly fat people don't to give up Biryani and beer then they deny that they have belly fat so so we got a cast task cut out but look the doctor the gastro is saying get your belly fat down get your beer down that's alcohol correct and and B basically Biryani for those who are uninitiated and not from India it means food eating too much of food Biryani yeah yeah Biryani itself is an emotion that's a different story do you know the highest sour food on the e-commerce Platforms in India is Biryani abolutely which is why there's this full startup generation of different biryanis happening because we just love Biryani and so I think keep eating Biryani because you'll keep Dr Paul and me in business okay what is the alternative to white rice for South Indians from Telangana H so I have a wonderful hack for it I love white rice okay I always include white rice yes brown rice is good slightly better but I don't like the taste of the brown rice for me so I always do white rice but I just make sure that I have at least three servings of vegetables along with the white rice no matter what uh I try to if I have only one vegetables then I increase that serving okay so make sure that you have fiber from additional sources when you have white rice it's like when you go out parting make sure there's one person who is not drinking I think that's the equivalent of vegetable being there with rice they're celebrating with rice and the vegetables are behaving like the the driver that's going to take human and responsibly like everyone low blood sugar level you know I'm going to take care of your fiber the police is a gastroenterologist when they have oh fiber is there okay good we can leave you're not cutting a fine ticket at that point okay I'm a 21-year-old girl why do I have gastric issues when I eat fast food or oily Foods um is this is this a a Mis Noma that young people have indestructible guts yes no this this might be true in one way because their abuse has not been translated into clinical symptoms yet so but if you talk to a 40-year-old like me everybody will tell you that I wish I would have eaten right between 15 to 30 I think the long-term damage I mean all this damage is long-term it doesn't happen right away and the actual effect happens 10 to 15 years after and that is the problem in fact the question has the answer itself because why do I have gastric issues when I eat fast food or oily Foods as a nutritionist I would tell you this the answer is in your question fast food and oily foods cause gastritis you are you you being activated and just because you're 21 years of age doesn't mean you're immune to it it just means that Dr Paul gets you much younger as a patient you know so take care of what you put into your body so I say that you know people say oh I have hemorrhoids whenever I sit down uh I have pain I said don't sit down sit up the the patient must be thinking which doctor have I come to right now but uh with the sense of humor okay we moving from the solid Department to the gaseous department so Vapor Department after every meal there is gas formation in my stomach gas formation in my stomach so let's gas does gas form in the stomach does it form in the small intestine does it form in the large intestine and why is that gas production What could could be the reason yeah so there are two main reasons I think main problem with many people over here is I think irritable bubble syndrome IBS where your stomach and colon are extremely sensitive and the reason that it became sensitive is because it has not been fed the right amount of food that the intestine wants and what happens is due course of time it's always a balance between your good gut bacteria and your bad gut bacteria you want good gut to be up bad gut to be low so that the balance is perfect but because of the processed foods Ultra processed foods or whatever you are doing this balance is reverse and this bad gun bacteria loves sugar loves cars so you eat cup they make you crave for cups you eat crops and then the bacteria digests and then releases CO2 releases gas and then that can manifest as bloing it can manifest as flatulence and that's why we call there is a condition called sibo we call it as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth so they're not supposed to be there at that small intestine are that much amount of amounts so working with doctors is a privilege that I always have and Dr P for me is on free time with me right now on my podcast H shots so we going to ask you many questions that you've asked a very relevant question doc somebody asked us how to reduce creatinin levels in a diabetic patient I have two sub questions that what is creatinin and who is diabetic okay so diabetic is an easy answer okay you have like increased glucose levels your pancreas insulin regulation is not happening uh creatinine is a measurement of your kidney function the only way that we can find your kidney is working or not is a blood test okay if we shut down all the blood test in the world there is no way that we can find your kidney is damaged or not until it turns Advanced so creatinine is a basic essential thing so why are we talking about diabetes and creatinine is diabetes on a long-term uh in longterm effect it causes end organ damage which is including kidney so we call that as diabetic nephropathy where because of the uncontrolled diabetes the glucose levels have compromised the kidney function and how do we know the creatinine level will go up and we know on the routine blood check when people do it for diabetes and that's why patients with diabetes get routine blood checkup you know they check their eyes they check their foot because eyes is because of endog damage of the eyes and foot because the nerve supply to the foot gets uh compromised where they will not even feel hot or cold so they step on uh flow even with hot water they will not be able to figure out which means the glucose levels of the body so high that it has compromised the function of the nerves that's called diabetic neuropathy when it damages the retina of the ice it's called diabetic retinopathy and when it damages the kidneys it's called diabetic nephropathy and the last one is I a Gaston olist you know what I heard in all of that I just saw a sugar molecule slapping me sugar slapping my eyes sugar slapping my heart sugar slapping my kidney is that what it's doing pretty much high amounts of sugar where you're not able to manage again comes back to the long-term abuse of the body and so basically I think so when the person's asked us how to reduce creatinin levels in a diabetic patient so the ancus decrease the glucose levels kidney function will get better do think fasting would help absolutely absolutely you know uh have you had any crazy cases where you know the blood tests are like of all these kidneys and liver and whatever blood markers you check like they're all crazy and then you had a person change their diet and do fasting and have you seen miracles in like very fast period yeah you know this fasting sanm is very close to my heart so what I did was I started this um weightless program it's called new me new me new me okay it's an online weight loss program where I figure out whether they are diabetic or Not by a simple 35-year-old coming in you know I need to lose weight so we do some blood work and then you will be surprised where the A1C level which is the measurement of your diabetes is Sky High like 11 normal are only know like they don't even know that they even know right so then I said that you know I sit with them in my clinical practice that's what I do you know and then I check with them in terms of uh okay let's start with your fasting that ially we don't go like one meal a day no severe fasting because of the insulin diabetes regulation is a little bit very tricky fasting works but very carefully in diabetes along with the supervised regimen under a physician guidance so can I say that you truly are a doctor that prescribes fasting as a form of medical treatment also as a prescription yeah very individualized very individually that's a key that's a key yeah I don't go extremes at the same time one plan is not for the same for everybody I can say okay go for like 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. I don't think that's a way okay doctor this is a female asking this question due to pcod tablets polycystic ovarian disorder I mean you know that but for those who are not aware outside so women have this condition which affects their ovaries they take a tablet I'm not aware what the medication is so she says I'm not able to consume any proper food any suggestions so PCOS is not a disease it is linked to your circadian rhythm it's linked to your hormonal imbalance unfortunately women are at a disadvantage compared to us because women have so many hormones to be balanced estrogen progesterone all we have is testosterone and we get away with it and they go through so much hormonal changes every month can you imagine every cell is dying and then waking up again generating again every month they go through a lot for them to have a good balanced hormones their circadian rythm has to be even on the top of the game and uh the medication that she's talking about is metformin what metformin does is it just tries to improve the sensitivity of the insulin so the insulin Works a little bit more so that the OM follicles and everything can um come out with good quality by collaborating with estrogen Prestone so as a doctor would you say that's one part of helping women along the pcod journey or reducing it is weight loss Big Time weight loss is not one part that is the major part if they lose weight they will not be any medications at all so I'm just my mind is going 30,000 Cycles a second because nowadays I'm getting a lot of teenagers 18 19 20 21 year old girls coming into our nutrition clinic with pcod condition and could one of the prescriptions be I need to get your body fat percentage down all your prescription should have it uh that that's a no-brainer it has to be I think the bottom line mechanism is because of this distance now she says you're not able to consume proper food so I don't know if teenagers or girls or ladies consume proper food all the time but do you think that metformin can also uh blun your appetite or affect you metformin can influence your uh gastric uh dis as a gastro youve seen people that take medication and it changes their so we usually saw diarrhea people take B Forin and then they just start having like more loose tools compared to before so then we decrease the dose AG we adjust accordingly okay somebody's asking can we have tea or coffee once in a while I feel gastric discomfort when I consume it regularly my mother-in-law she's a gynecologist she's a South Indian tamb Bram she loves her coffee this sounds like her right now please suggest whether I can drink it once in a blue no absolutely provide that if it is if your stomach is okay with it when you when you when you got a wound and it's hurting you you can't go and dig into that wound is is what you're saying right but when you do all the other stuffs right that wound will be healed and you can go back to your routine so are you saying that kind of dig a little bit deeper and see why you're facing a problem and don't blame tea or coffee there could be other triggers that's what you want to tell your brother-in-law [Laughter] yeah my mental health affects my digestion how can I fix it or improve it sleep me time your mental health and your digestion is linked with a common mechanism called sleep that's why you're talking about cirium which is part of the sleep cycle and the Wake Up Cycle your body needs rest we just abusing it so much just slow down take rest make sure that you have 7 hours of quality sleep your body's hormones are so powerful than what you think I am predicting and I can see the future and and I can see the present I'm in Dr Paul's consultancy Clinic he's writing on his prescription pad less watching of Netflix no binge watching of Netflix correct acidity will disappear gut brain access will improve if you're watching Ryan channel it's okay but we we are only 45 minutes and watch us during the daytime not at the night time yeah exactly we're child we're we're children friendly how how to overcome vitamin deficiencies in vegetarian in America do you see a lot of vegetarians Huge lot lot of our Indians are vegetarian right and not indians American people they're also deficient yeah it becoming like a a fashionable state so so what's it like I would love to be the fly on the wall in your consultation room somebody comes and like hey Doc I'm vgy I'm vegan I'm vegetarian and then you're looking at them and you're like what are you looking for I like looking at the blood test are you looking at anything from their body how how does it work how does your brain work or mind work work with such people walking in when they say they're vegetarian like how how you clinically diagnosing people um like for example somebody walks in can you say that they vegetarian or vacon very difficult yeah I but the moment they tell you that then so but actually I can say based on looking at the stomach and colon I can guess educated guests ah so I've seen and you see vitamin deficiencies from that no no vitam deficiency we're talking about B12 deficiency as you know uh long that is not a huge problem because even if you are deficient in B12 supplementation takes care of the problem um so that is not a huge thing what I was trying to say was gut bacteria loves vegetarian food more than non-vegetarian food that is kind of proven on basic science research and also clinical research well so when we do the endoscopy a camera going to the stomach we see I personally feel like the stomach is less angry and I ask them who you know or you after the procedure I ask them or you vegetarian they'll say yes same thing in if I do a colonoscopy I don't see any pops at all and then that PO patient will be a 65y old Caucasian man how can you are not having a poip you eat your diet is like processed meat and everything uh he said no I'm a vegetarian so I'm going to throw a little bit of controversy into the pot there are doctors out there in the West for the Western Caucasian population that are recommending only a meat diet carore diet the carnivore diet right so you've heard about this yeah yeah have you seen Carnivor come in and do the endoscopy and you're seeing disaster inside of them a lot of pops but have you also seen like the vegetarian a clear gut is it bioindividual also for people when yes yes absolutely it is bio individual but the probability the probability is lower in a vegetarian diet but doesn't mean that you know meat is wrong what I'm what I'm trying to say is our gun bacteria loves fiber and fiber is in vegetarian food if you're having nonvegetarian make sure that you have lots of fiber as well I'm going to be having my steak with a lot of broccoli cucumber and zucchini so that's what I want to be doing yeah yeah so one thing I want to tell you was I always tell my patients don't choose vegetarian or don't choose non-vegetarian be do palarian what's that Dr palarian Dr palarian is you know three meals a day yeah 7 days a week 21 meals a week yes and out of this 21 80% vegetarian so 15 16 meals is vegetarian then remaining four meals you go non-vegetarian and you can eat whatever you want if you're eating red meat limit to 500 G per week that's a nice one I've never heard before limit nonvegetarian to 500 G no no red meat red meat uh to 500 G per week if possible correct nice one one common problem in gastric issues we are seeing is that um more and more of the teenagers more and more of the working individuals are complaining of gastric problems and we're talking about an age group of 15 to 30 but you're seeing a lot of older people so is there something that you seeing in your practice where more youngsters are coming in with gastric problem so I I when when a patient walks in there are only two age groups that walks into my patient office one is 60 65 and other one is 20 30 so the 2030s are walking in because of because of abdominal pain crms bloating uh oh this food is not adapting to my gut you know what should I do and the first question that I ask is what are you doing uh in terms of a profession and most of the times especially in India uh when I see patients uh they work for a foreign company in us and they work night shift and they work from 10: p.m. to 6:00 a.m. where the graveyard shift graveyard shift because it's in us it's the morning time correct right and uh again you're disturbing a sarian rhythm the first thing that goes wrong when you're disturbing a sarian rhythm is gut and that's why they say go with your gut I'm going to go a little Star Trek on our podcast the gut microbiome I read a study somewhere that they have started fecal Bank transplants um can you talk to us about what is this fecal Bank transplant and is it true that when they take uh the donor FAL and put it into a bad person there have been incidences of improvement of the gut health yes we do you know we do fecal transplantation for a disease called C diffusal colitis okay where it is a bacteria that comes into the body and affects the colon and makes the colon looks very inflamed and angry and uh no matter what medication that we give we will not be able to is it true SE defil tries in a non-v environment non non-vegetarian diet no I mean I don't why does this bad guy come into the body oh because of you know antibiotic exposure so we do lots of antibiotics and uh you know whenever there is Factor as multiple antibiotic exposure then you'll see the fil gets so we see this in children yes but not that common not that common uh adult Big T so an athlete one day came to me and says sir can I do feal transplant because I heard that a faster athlete has better bacteria so can I get his poop into me so is there any logic to this do you see Medical Science going in that direction I think 5 years from now we'll be talking some kind of sense but not right now okay but multiple research are going in that field though but nothing concrete um so but it is true in maice when you transplant uh a bad bacteria into a good good bacteria the maice will have behavioral problems we have anxiety issues um well that'll be translated into clinical practice that's what people are doing right now so is it true that before our body digests food the bacteria in our gut the microbiome actually first eats the food uh no no that's not true because when you when you eating it goes into the stomach the stomach as it digest the food and then gets into the small intestine and we get the first bite ah small intestine has all these enzymes like pancreas secretes enzyme digesting fats you know stomach also secrete digesting proteins and carbs all these are getting digested in your small intestine and after everything is done only the roughage goes into the coal and that rff should have fiber to feed the bacteria in the colon U so they get the second bite but we need to make sure that we feed them as well interesting this is my question it's a funny question how much of farting defines you to be a fter or not a fter is there a medical Benchmark because people come to me and says I got a lot of gas so I ask them have you farted in my chamber right now so they no like you don't have a gas problem so how do we how do we advise people because people have different senses of laughter different senses of I'm strong you're strong I'm not stronger so from a farting perspective gas production burping and farting what do you think is a sense of a barometer so I think it is again individualized it's based on you know how frequent it is and then key thing is what are the other G problem that you are having let's say you are having constipation you're having bloating then that flatulence is a significant problem interesting so what I do is I tell a person eat a certain food and tell me three to four hours later are you creating more gas huh that's true the first treatment that we do when patients come with flatulence is food diary ah so you document everything what you eat when when is the most amount of gas production if Tesla could only run on human gas we would have uh indigenous vehicles and the patients will ask me uh sir is it has to be a written format or you want a video format I said no written format is okay I was about to ask you is there audio included in that like what level of velocity of noise are you creating so much of volume of gas so much of decb but jok's apart as people get older right as I have gotten old and I'm moving towards my 50s I've noticed in certain foods on certain days that I eat I will produce more gas I will will fart more and sometimes it's um it's embarrassing because you try to get the silent fart and you know it's the noisy fart that's also still good but then you get the smelly fart as a gastro doctor are we looking for anything which can tell us that you need to change your diet or change your health in the gas department so whenever the flatulance is bothering you know whenever it is compromising the quality of life so for example I've sent many patient know I'm in the meeting and uh you know I need to run to the restaurant to have the gas released uh and it is happening very repeatedly and that's where the problem is right and then invariably as we talked about most of the times it is a dis it is a lack of balance between a good and bad good bacteria few Common Sense questions is it true that everybody in the human race has to go to party first thing in the morning absolutely not true not true right abely not true you've seen different patients party at different times of the yeah even you know the normal M you know when you eat something and comes out of the Sprinter muscle it usually takes like you know 50 hours 50 hours so India listen in carefully you don't need to go to the toilet every day to decide that you have a constipation problem absolutely now if I ask that question do people have a poy move if it's 50 hours you're talking about almost two days sometimes huh so if you ideally many of the patients will go like once a day uh because of the you know uh my athletes go two three times a day because obviously I'm feeding them more right maybe a lot of fiber we don't know yeah but but so to so let me let me track back and then say thaty actually a definition of constipation itself it's not like if you don't go once a day you see what is your normal Baseline so you go once every two days once every 3 days it's absolutely okay but you have been going once every 3 days but now it's once in 7 Days that's constipation that what is the change in the frequency of the B moment I this client of mine and he constantly complains that I go to the toilet I sit down and I have sensation to potty but nothing comes out what is that called and what could be the probable reasons so it's called tenesmus kind of thing okay uh where you go to the bathroom and you have the feeling of evacuation but the evacuation is not happening which means that the brain is not talking to the gut properly so it's like a biof feedback mechanism can that be retrained back again yes absolutely yes so they need to contact a gastroenterologist for them right no I know if you dive deep into it the basic Lifestyle Changes will be the treatment of choice do you prescribe walking for any of these conditions gas indigestion IBS and all so physical activity has been shown to promote good get bacteria so exercising gives me good bacteria which keeps my gut healthy absolutely another prescription is please exercise what exercise so actually anything any even walking is also okay but has to be a little bit of a faster pace and I think walking shakes everything out of your body as it keeps moving anything but sometimes strength training has been shown to um you know promote all these uh it hits the right knot on all the hormones and chemicals and that promotes more good good bacteria as well awesome awesome doctor final few questions if you had to give everybody out there advice because you have a camera inside people and you see the damage what are the five tips that you would give everyone to follow as Dr Paul's tips so the first thing is you need to wind down after Sunset wind down after Sunset huh uh number two drinking water at least 2 liters per day drinking 2 liters of water every day huh sleep big time 7 hours a day minimum s hours a day and then number four lots of fiber lots of fiber your favorite fiber food my favorite fiber food is broccoli oh you love broccoli ah I love broccoli I also love broccoli I hold bow this morning I love broccoli and also spinach the fifth one is meditation I tell my patients that you need to start meditating at least 2 minutes a day to start with and the reason is meditation is the non-medication way to train your brain G access for somebody who has never been initiated to meditation as a doctor how would you write that prescription meditation what should we do what should I do sit down H so I have never been meditat in the past okay so when I started to learn about brain gut axis gut bacteria and how everything is like so related my goto thing was okay where do I start correct so I picked up this meditation called heartfulness meditation you know I like this organization because my neighbor was doing this and then he asked me to come and then do meditation with him and they are a wonderful organization nonprofit and they're doing everything for free they don't charge anything at all believe it are not throughout the world there is heartfulness trainers everywhere where anybody who wants to get trained you just go and see a preceptor and then they will train you how to meditate online or in person online in person actually both online in person even Bangalore has it Hyderabad has every so we all going to start meditation soon you five heartfulness heartfulness heartfulness awesome so those are the five tips from Dr Paul Dr Paul if you were not a gastro I know you'd say standup comedian but if not a standup comedian and gastro what would you be you know I want to be a a lifestyle physician okay I want to tell patients that family doctor maybe no see what what's a family doctor and what's a lifestyle physician see family doctor is you know treats all the problems right uh so let's say you have asthma so he needs inhalers and he uh treats all those things when I say lifesty physician is now I have figured out that all the problems is are caused by the lifestyle okay our nutrition plays a big role that's why I have a huge respect for what you do nutritionist is not easy job so nutrition generally seeing the patient as a whole and not just focusing on the asthma alone and if I have a time I will spend two hours with a patient every week for 3 months I'll make sure that they will never get a problem ever again so that they will never see a doctor awesome awesome I want quick digestion I want quick answers and who better than Dr Paul to give us a rapid fire okay eating Sprouts raw cooked and to be honest both are okay raw meat good for your stomach not good for your stomach raw meat yeah Sushi Oh sushi okay in general our G bacteria is better on vegetarian let me put it that way so but doesn't mean that you know one typi or something is bad but from a gastro that's a gastrologist answer there's this article saying playing in mud restores microbiome for kids your take yes absolutely so we should go back and get dirty absolutely no question stop using too much of sanitizers and chemicals in the house yes big time what should we look in ingredients before buying them the first three ingredient should not be sugar first three should not be sugar that's a good one okay how do we preper gut for long use of antibiotic medicines so antibiotics destroys the cut bacteria so so basically I always tell in all podcasts that the biggest pandemic that we are waiting to happen is antibiotic resistant bacteria where we will not have weapons like antibiotics to kill the bacteria so limit antibiotic use as much as possible and only take antibiotic only when prescribed by a doctor you cannot walk into a pharmacy and then say please give me some antibiotics things in our system that we Indians are adopting that are very bad considering food as an emotion doesn't have to be get logical turn it down a little bit so doctor I know your time is precious we got you for a few minutes and we answered everyone's questions so if you love Dr pal and know we are not the same person we two different people we both love each other comment and we would share with you tips from Dr Paul's podcast blog as well as his Instagram handle where you can directly get in touch with him if you liked this episode then please give me a like a
