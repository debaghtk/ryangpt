[0.00 - 3.24] hey everyone Ryan Fernando Sports
[1.68 - 6.18] nutritionist I hope you're chasing your
[3.24 - 9.30] dream I have done one Chase to help you
[6.18 - 12.12] Chase down that dream how a five is to
[9.30 - 13.80] one sodium to potassium designed in this
[12.12 - 16.44] isotonic sports drink now this sounds
[13.80 - 19.74] like all bizarre words but when you
[16.44 - 22.68] sweat you lose five times the amount of
[19.74 - 24.72] sodium which is a mineral on your sweat
[22.68 - 26.58] if you ever tasted your sweat it's salty
[24.72 - 30.24] that's five times the amount of sodium
[26.58 - 33.44] to one time of potassium so one Chase is
[30.24 - 36.18] designed to replenish the same
[33.44 - 38.10] electrolytes minerals that you lose in
[36.18 - 40.86] your sweat so it becomes a sweat
[38.10 - 42.66] replenisher meaning it gets in and gives
[40.86 - 44.82] you a thumbs up which is why when
[42.66 - 47.24] chasing your dreams you won't cramp on
[44.82 - 47.24] one Chase
