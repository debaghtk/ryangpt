Transcript: if it comes in a plastic packet you should be a little bit cautious first so let's assume you want to buy something from a plastic packet whether it's Biscuits energy bar an irrated beverage whatever it is they will have words written on the ingredient the only thing is not to be too intelligent about reading the label be intelligent about just saying it's a chemical and if I'm doing it maybe once or twice a month thumbs up but if you're doing it every day so for example there is a health drink which recently went to court by the government and they said you have to remove the health drink label on it and all the e-commerce apps I've been asked to delist it and put it into a normal beverage category I looked at this health beverage what I found out was it did not have chocolate in it it had chocolate flavoring don't look for any exotic chemical name look for the word flavor if flavor is there you know it's chemical because if you want a chocolate you will get cacao or cocoa bean and that is very expensive but when you look at something added into a milkshake or a beverage and it says chocolate flavor strawberry flavor that is just a chemical synthetic flavor you're being corned into eating something at a taste B level not at a nutritive level
