you live it's very important to understand that these super busy individuals are taking time out of their super busy schedules to come and make time to understand what they can do for their body so I'm going to be having this lecture with them about how in spite of their Millions how can they get to the next level where their body is the most valuable asset so join me in this lecture as I share some some secrets with people on how to change the way you should be living there is one thing I do want to say about that first thank you for doing this he this is a pleasure to have you here and thank you all joining this is this is something that happened in short not this but I'm glad you could squeeze Us in um Ryan and you guys know celebrity nutritionist but I think as a mother I a lot of things doing beyond that including podcast and books yeah um but the cool thing is that I think Ryan is the ch they get having a lot of folks have have worked with them in the past uh all I've heard is good things and being s many hands- on so we are grateful that you could join us thank you so much and would love to hear your recipe for so thanks for being here thank you sir thank you the celebrity nutritionist is because most of you know that if you have a product you need to Market it and the problem with nutrition everyone owns nutrition including my mother so it become very difficult to convince people that they're good and you know they need advice for one nutritionist so a little bit of background about myself my dad's a the million my mom's a go and so my limbo soda blend okay and I studied at Goa Medical College I am not a doctor and did my clinical biochemistry food biotech Masters half a dozen certification degrees and all I worked for one of the largest supplement companies in the world before I started my own nutrition clinic so as a nutritionist I sold ambay daily all of these products and I utilize one of the largest companies in the world for for supplements and I couldn't get a job in research because I hated the lab okay so I didn't want to go into the lab and do blood testing and pipeting and all that stuff so when I sold supplements in 200 and uh sorry in 1999 so I'm 48 years of age so I'm uh at at that 1975 B just to give you a context of age um every time I sold a supplement people say so over the years when I was working with the supplement companies I realized I had more teams of doctors and dietitians than sales guys because you brought a protein powder and then you called up the call center said how do I do my diet uh in 2010 I launched my own Clinic called Quan nutrition Quan Latin means incapacity so I used to play Scrabble I don't know how many of you have ever played Scrabble so it's a word game and if you ever get Q you're stuck because Q is a very difficult thing to make with seven letters and you need a u so for a strategic point of view if you got q and u you got a high number of points otherwise you're screwed so the fastest word in with q and u you could make the only threel word isqa QA so my friends used to fight with me and say it's not there me to open the dictionary qua and Latin means in capacity of or in character of so said we take Quan put nutrition discover the people's nutrition capacity so fast forward a decade and a half we are now 75 dieticians across the world with the fortune of Technology my California Indians get on a call with me and we do their health now we not only do nutrition we do genetic testing we do blood testing we do omega-3 testing we do microbiome poop testing so you may have heard of all of these things happening so what I do is when I go into a room like this is I convince people that your body is the most expensive real estate you'll ever own now I know what is the collective net worth of this room each one of you have all the I was just listening to conversation I created this company this happened and all but you are your most valuable asset and there's no denying that and so when I start working with people the first thing that I'm doing is I'm asking them for a longevity point of view when do you decide you want to live longer when do you decide that your health is a pain in your backside so there is a point in your life where suddenly something starts coming to you and it depends on your personality either you pop a pill and you say it's okay I'm a warrior I can go forward or you're like dude I need to nip this in a butd because my data set is saying that this quarter is not is not good in my body so then people start talking my friend has done intermittent fasting American guys recommending keto then my neighborhood friend he went to Baba Ram's Retreat he's doing this diet so there are a lot of people out there including me who kind of put these things together and advise people very early on when I left the supplement company to start my business I went undercover and went to 105 doctors nutritionist and alling what they have to offer most of it was in the timeline of a person for that one month of service so I said if I do this you'll be like a doctor 15 minutes next person 15 minutes next person so you're just like a rat on a treadmill so I was like let's do it in a way find the people who are like my body is a r Rice I'm driving it like an 800 I need to bring it for a service and this we've been doing since 2010 people would come to us and say why do I need to do a gene test so what is a gene test human body Hardware genetics is your software genetics is your software now your mother and father have given you your destiny in terms of your genetics so I'll give you an example of a very simple thing to understand you may have heard of anemia which is low iron everyone's heard about anemia we all know anemia is is a genetic thing so you could inherit anemia from your parent now research is showing you could do infusion or you would take an iron supplement so that's called epigenetic you take something from the environment and put it onto your body okay let's do a gene test now when I started in 2010 we were doing about 152 genes now they giving the coding of the whole body for about a lck and a half now this is Crystal Ball gazing into your future now here comes the problem there are two sets of people on the planet people who want to know they want forecasting data and people who say don't give me forecasting data don't give me research don't give me anything I'll make my own pathway depending on your type people who say I don't want to know I say do the nutrition genetic testing do the fitness genetic testing why Nutrition Fitness let's say for example like I have a magnesium deficiency Gene so my body in the pumpkin seeds and in the dark chocolate doesn't pull up magnesium very well so when I work out I get very tight carves are they cramp the moment I take a magnesium supplement for months on end I don't cramp I go for a vacation I forget to take my magnesium after walking wherever I'm walking you know when you go on holidays we walk the most the car start cramping so the subset data of magnesium genetic deficiency he has given me a crystal ball gazing that I need to supplement with magnesium I am also gluten intolerant so when ASA said please have dinner my first thought was  I don't know if there going to be something gluten-free because that that that crep came to me and it was I can't eat it because it's got wheat in it now I have very poked skin because I had adult acne all my life so that guy in the lab in now being a one I don't know if you know but in Goa we're all about bread we're known as paas we eat bread in morning we eat bread in afternoon so I had all this adult acne and nobody told us that bread was a culprit post doing the gene test as a cele as a nutrition that time I was not a celebrate as a nutrition I said let me stop it for 90 days 90 days pimp all the clarisel all the sead all the Dermatology creams that I used for two decades it just disappeared so I changed something because of a genetic forecasting weight training my Gene says I can never become un I have a gene which is deficient in building muscle so now what happens is I enjoy my workout other walk what should I do should I work out for 20 minutes should I work out for 3 hours so you will find as the world advances with variables so if you're wearing an exercise variable use it for heart rate monitoring don't use it for Sleep the Sleep data is not that accurate I'll introduce you to Dr Shane in us he's a sleep doctor he's one of the world's best with Dr danan he gave me an input I'm a huge fan of Whoop I'm a huge fan of whoop in fact if you saw vat for the World Cup so by the way verat kohy has been my client also I have a whole list of all of these big shot guys I recommend the because it's one of those variables which which doesn't distract you it gives you strain it gives you sleep he told me the Sleep data is not accurate so now what's happening is all my clients are stressing on sleep data coming back to data and genetics have an exercise variable that tells you your heart rate so today my heart rate is at 107 let me tell you why I have a cold today my son gave me the cold yesterday so I'm battling it so because I'm battling it when I do a seminar my normal heart rate when standing is 90 right now it's at 110 why is the heart rate higher because when you're stressed out or your body is battling something or you're undergoing emotional stress or psychological stress or a wrong food stress food poisoning or a virus your heart rate goes up so this can help you combat behaviors during the day could you rest a little bit more could you take um a Tulsi CA could you take something so all of these come in the forecasting of nutrition and fitness genetic the people that want to know then you do the health screening right so in my health screening fortunately touchwood I don't have one or two of the major cancer things but I have the heart Genet so I have got cardiomyopathy and one more which apparently 60% of Indians have so what do you do next you screen every year dad are you're going for a heart test why what did I do it's like you're going for a heart test so I screen my dad at 76 every year and all the scans are clear so what happened is the gene has a high risk but you are lucky enough to not be dealt the card so far because on one hand you have your genetics on one hand you have your environment the way I can pictorially give this to you is you have heard of Russian Roulette Russian Roulette is they put a bullet one bullet in the gun they roll it and they click it the gun is your genetics the bullet is your lifestyle so if you have a gene for high risk now suddenly you smoke you drink you eat a high fat diet you're putting not one bullet in the gun you're putting multiple bullets in the gun and then the other thing is forced Behavior you you keep pulling the trigger so you can also not have the gun you can have the bullet and take the bullet and actually push it into your skull that is have no genetics but also have lifestyle this is more prevalent today because of the vaccination what we are finding out is post the vaccination the incidences of stroke or heart attack are higher so suppose you have blood testing give you of forecasting data even genetic testing which is more into your what's your family trajectory and then now the latest is the poop analysis the stool so now they're finding out you have more bacteria inside of you than actually human cells and this is called the gut microb so everybody in the US is talking about this naen J is talking about it biome is talking about it now India's half a dozen companies relian is invested it there's so much of research happening is that they're finding out that even rheumatoid arthritis is happening because of a gut microbi so there is one bacteria there that decid starts misbehaving why does it misbehave because of the environment on your microb so you have gundas and you have good guys as you grow older the good guys tend to die out why do they die out because maybe of your genetics or because of your lifestyle now the lifestyle that I control is sleep and diet and exercise I don't control the the the environment of psychology for that you need a mind coach you know a brain specialist um so coming back to these These are the tools okay for example in the other days I mean there's a very sensitive topic somebody committed suicide and I was very um blasy about it I like told my wife vitamin B2 deficiency and his microbiome was off and he should have taken omega-3 she like how can you say something so insensitive most of the problems that are happening today is because the omega3 to Omega 6 imbalan is happening in the food chain we're eating too much of fertilizers and pesticides in the food so the first billion doll tip for you to take home don't follow a diet just go to your Logistics in your kitchen and ask them start getting me everything organic you have enough of money to start your own farm and start growing and even if it's a loss making Venture you get tomatoes that enter you that are pristine so number one tip for you to leave today is as many exposures as you have in the food that you control try and eat organic so my rice my Dal my Staples I try and buy organic my fruits and vegetables I figure it out in the organic M two three contacts and all we get that and I'll share a story with from my home SOA is my housekeeping lady she cooks food for me my wife and my son like pomegranate are you getting the Symmetry the one that's sprayed with chemicals never gets a Kea the one that's sprayed with chemical looks beautiful the organic stuff invariably is small wrinkly and ugly but your liver and your kidney absolutely love Organics so as an elite group of people this this is my first giveaway to you you don't need to follow diet plan next decade switch to eating healthier organic second do the testing to figure out what works in your body and what does not work in your body I'll move out from omega3 to from the brain health and all but you can just do a 2,400 rupe pin prick blood test and check your omega3 and Omega 6 level most of you in this room including me as a nutritionist I had a 31 is to1 ratio where the normal ratio should be 3 is to1 my son had 131 is to1 which is why he was not paying attention to class and the moment we change the Omega ratio teacher called me up 4 months later like what have you done to your son he's become an angel so these are small things that we can do from brain chemistry because our brain is made up of 60% fat so the fats we're eating in our diet are not the right fats so that calmness in your thinking changes so these are the Diagnostics doing a diet plan and doing a nutrition plan is tough especially for people in this room because of your schedules your businesses and all of that stuff you travel you eat in hotels you go here you go there and all so what I say is 365 days in a year into 3 meals a day it's about 1,000 meals see if you can be Rock Solid every year by on 500 meals going into your body if you can do that the body will accept the other 500 start and this process by the time you're into your 50s 5560s you will start changing your travel schedule you'll be more particular about your foods at that point go to about 800 meals a year which are in your control what you choose sleep research is showing uh in Stanford they did a study they sleep deprived people from 8 hours to 6 hours the hippo campus showed 40% reduction in memorization and focus the next day if you're entering a board meeting please understand and you know this better than me when my team presents to me over 6 hours in a day I cannot falter for even 10 seconds because they change the slide and go to something else on the business performance I have to catch that error so my brain has to be alerted so the 2 days before any board meeting in my company I asked my secretary not to book any evening counselings I try not to put Netflix on on those two days and go to bed and I do a little bit of biohacking I have two magnets under my mattress I punch in a special program and so there's a lot of biohacking that we can do when you come to me there stuff which rejuvenates mitochondria in your body which gives you very deep sleep so if any of you have I'm not going to disclose over you which of you have sleep problem but if you have a sleep problem and stuff like that later on just just talk to me about it so one is to biohack your sleep using magnets that mimics the Earth's resonance that's another way to put you into sleep so we did the Sleep part so please get the 8 hours sleep I can't sleep for 8 hours change your diet move to 6 8 hours no no but I've always in Medical College I I did 6 hours of sleep and stuff like that today's lecture is about longevity longevity talks about reducing sugar and sleeping better simple sugar there's this thing called hba1c um anyone who has an hbon above seven in this room you got to take control of it gly glycation of hemoglobin meaning what sugar is going and giving T to hemoglobin whil that level is giving you glycation of hemoglobin it's also telling you that the sugar is attacking your DNA so you don't need to follow a diet plan get a blood test and determine your fasting sugar level your early morning sugar sugar level your post brander better still you must have seen all these people sporting those CGM devices if you're a gamification freak please wear one I was super entertained when I W one last year Christmas time Biryani two glasses of champagne sugar cup one came down 4:00 in the evening two more sugar spikes I had not eaten anything so like next week I tried only Biryani single sugar Spike next week after that no Biryani tried champagne double sugar Spike so somehow the bubbly for me creates a sugar Spike my brother orange juice no sugar Spike so both of us drank orange juice together and we're looking at our phones so by the way this device gives real time sugar levels I got a sugar Spike with with orange juice he got none but we nutritionist are telling people there is glycemic index it is how much sugar the rice is giving you so please eat brown rice brown rice has lower glycemic index it gives lower sugar to the blood I ate brown rice I got a sugar Spike I ate white rice I didn't get a sugar Spike hello how is that and so so I'm getting a lot of very I told you so kind of smiles a decade later because when I started doing genetic testing in this country every doctor laughed at me we started doing specialized testing everyone started laughing like no need to spend this money and these are doctors talking about it but today everyone's talking about the poop test the CGM test and all and why am I laughing because when we did Qua we said it is your individuality so there are people who can survive on one meal a day so when I put people on the C GM and the watch and the Heart rat and these blood tests we're suddenly finding out some people like me I can't do a one meal a day my sugar drops so badly then it Peaks after that so I've got to do minimum two meals a day and there are some people I have this one gentleman he fasts for 8 Days he's only doing cucumber and dry fruits and anything and he's like a crazy helmit is a 65 or whatever sugar line is stable line so if you want to know more about sugar and anti-aging there's a guy called Dr David Sinclair Dr David Sinclair is one of the leading researchers in the world he's in New York who basically talks about anti-aging so sinair has the equivalent of I think 300 glasses of wine a day but he doesn't drink that much alcohol the res troll so up until now what the wine industry was doing is like wine is very good for anti-aging and heart disease but now they're finding out it is the res trol in the grape that has got an anti-aging Factor to the extent that the mice that they did the research on when they gave them Resveratrol and another medical product called Ramy they found the mice lived 30% longer so if you watch Dr David Sinclair's videos he doesn't look older than 40 years of age but he's already in his 50s so this longevity perspective is coming from small small perspectives like this but I would say to you so have you ever seen that Zen car with the Ferrari sticker on it right now imagine your body Zen but you put a Ferrari sticker that's your thinking I want to be healthy same thing happens in my clinic people come in I will do whatever I want to do you give me resveratol you give me anti-aging you give me collagen you give me nmn you give me all the antien so that's like a sticker on my talk to you today is just do one thing as a starter focus on the Dal chavel Roy first in the next decade are these supplements good to take if you take them take them under guidance take them with a blood test so you know oh this is my liver enzyme these are my kidney enzyme this is my hemoglobin these are all my vitamins and mins I take this stuff 6 months later check it out and so that leads you to one of the leading proponents of longevity on the planet he is an entrepreneur like you a billionaire his name is Brian Johnson you must have seen him on Instagram on LinkedIn and everything so what Brian Johnson is doing he's taking 111 supplements a day he's doing all the possible things as a 46 year old and his biological age is 18 by the way at 48 I'm at 35 years of biological age so imagine if I earn 1 CR a year and I'm supposed to live to 70 but now my biological age is 35 birth secret is 48 that's why I say your body is the most expensive real estate because if you are 15 years younger your net worth based on your earning per year I am the best investment that you can ever have which is longevity so why wait till you're 60 or 70 or 80 for the longevity investment start with every morning saying I am the most expensive real estate on the planet my mind is in charge of my body not my taste buts once you start telling your body this on an everyday you can set yourself on a track then you start taking data and the simplest data is I can give you my number after this you can WhatsApp me there's a scale costing 9,600 rupees it's called the omon K scan once or twice in the month you take measurements on that scale I'll send you a video it gives you your metabolic age it gives you a weight but it gives you your visceral fat and your body fat all you have to do is stand on that and understand your muscle muscle and fat muscle is the only age reversible organ in the human body so in America there was this old age home there was one group of people they told them boss we're putting Bingo Ludo and all in your basement other group of people 72y old they told boss we're putting a gym in your basement and you have to do exercise every day every day you have to come and do L extension these people 72 years old what do you want us to do all this look at the other people they're doing Bingo Ludo housy and all this stuff exercise 6 months later they came out and they took a biopsy from the quadrip muscle Bingo housing group jyming group they found that the muscle in this group grew by 6 months older the muscle in this group reversed in age by 6 years so the 72y old now had 66 year old muscles so that is why people today are asking you to weight train to resistance especially the women in the room the one asset for women is everyone goes for Pilatus zomba dance running yoga please do two weight training sessions you will thank me two decades later for the men it's a no-brainer you start weight training your testosterone goes up you just take a measurement of a testosterone today we train with a good trainer by the way don't every Top Shot I met know there is this thing inside of you because you have established yourself you are an expert you may be an expert but when you have a trainer standing with that room he is like your school principal he'll hold you accountable see when you run your businesses who holds you accountable only yourself so for your body ask somebody else to hold you accountable it's an eye opener I have five people I have Dr Arun he's my Physio and mechanics expert I have a karate master one of India's best sensiz he comes on private tutions I've got a Gym trainer I've got yoga come Pilatus trainer and I've got underwater breath hold trainer all of these guys so the cost of these Five Guys is the Emi for a luxury vehicle I bought a scoda superb cuz my body is the most expensive real estate you don't have to make make the decision in this room so get that expert coming up so even if like in 12 sessions a month of weight training 12 into 12 144 sessions set up 2024 can I do 144 sessions and ask that person to track you and pay that person cuz if that person turns up and trains you even if you do 100 sessions it's a win for your body you have started even if you do 50 sessions with a win for your body but trust me over a period of time 2024 you may do 24 sessions 2025 you may do 40 sessions but every decade you improve your weight training so I now have 23 kgs of muscle in my 70 kg frame so in the last 5 years it has not dropped in fact I've increased muscle by 800 G so that is the anti-aging battle that we can start before we start getting all the experts to India and going and injecting us with IV fluids so by the way if you want to do the intervenous infusions with glutathione and magnesium and meos cocktail it's safe to do under doctor's prescription nothing is going to happen the whiskey that we drink and the smoke that we inhale in our cities is far more worse than the longevity medical hacks that people are doing because they are done with a premise of making you younger so the question is are there any side effects yes you become younger are there any side effects to your systems maybe you like for example I'm allergic to vitamin C I can't take Vitamin C so when I did the vitamin C infusion I started itching so I can't take a vitamin C infusion but guava is my best friend because one guava is equivalent to four oranges so I'm asking my wife let's buy a guava farm so like why you want to buy a guav farm and just make friends with all the guava dealers in the country promote guavas and you know you'll get the best guavas so make guava your best friend so this is my summary today that you are the most expensive real estate wait train because it's going to help you does fasting work oh I could do like 4 hours on fasting the problem with telling people not to eat is dangerous because they're like no no this guy can't cut it and everything but once you start planning your Nutrition a little bit better you suddenly come to me like okay I'm sorted after 2 years can I fast for 24 hours so I'll give you the secret research is showing 30h hour fast is where you take a ly to the old mitochondria in your body and whack it out of your body and when you whack it out of the body the body says produce new mitochondria so when you're whacking on the old mitochondria in a 30 hour fast they're also whacking out the cancer cells so what our grandfathers and great-grandfathers did the special Fast in Hindu in Islam in Christianity I'm a Christian I'm a lazy Catholic lent season we're supposed to fast if it's in Raman there are 14 days which really you know focuses on the body and then we have uh in Hinduism you have your Mondays and Fridays and certain periods the navaratri period and all so please go in that direction final points if you're ever doing your blood test find a place that will collate your blood test and keep it because you guys are data guys you are businessmen the data of your own body is the best indicator 10 years later when you walk into a place and somebody says okay let's do your blood test like here's my last 10 years of blood data if I get something like that I'm likeing there's a trend line huh homo has increased in 2021 then it's come down so that would help you get to the next level and the final point I predict that AI is going to put me out of a job in the next 5 years and which is why I'm moving in the speaker Direction because AI cannot convince you to start a human being will have to convince you to [Music] [Applause] start
