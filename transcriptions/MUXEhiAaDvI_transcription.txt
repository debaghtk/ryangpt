Transcript: fasting work for some people for some people it's intermediate and some people it doesn't work at all I believe no one siiz fits on but in the general consensus the human race is eating too much today so what I do is when a patient walks in or a client walks in I first teach them the portions that they need to eat then as they move through a 3mon plan with me and they get comfortable with understanding portion understanding timing then I move the timing into shorter Windows of eating so we go from a 12h hour eating window to an 8 hour to a 6 hour eating window so when you come down to a 6-hour eating window which could be probably 12 noon to 6: p.m. the rest of the time you're not eating which you technically don't need to eat because you and I are DJs desk jockeys right so we're using our fingers and we're using our brains
