[0.08 - 4.44] genetics do play a keen factor I mean a
[2.68 - 6.68] lot of times when children come in for
[4.44 - 8.36] Pediatric nutrition counseling at I am
[6.68 - 10.44] looking at both the parents bringing in
[8.36 - 12.16] this 8-year-old to 15-year-old and if
[10.44 - 14.44] both the parents are quite Slim Trim and
[12.16 - 17.08] lean I asked the next question were you
[14.44 - 18.52] slim and skinny in school and college
[17.08 - 20.16] and if both the parents say yeah yeah
[18.52 - 22.04] you were skinny and like you can't
[20.16 - 24.00] expect anything different from your kid
[22.04 - 25.68] however if both the parents are healthy
[24.00 - 27.60] or have been on the heavier side and
[25.68 - 30.08] they have a child who's on the leaner
[27.60 - 32.00] side then I am now questioning is is
[30.08 - 34.28] there a nutritional deficiency is there
[32.00 - 35.96] an eating disorder is the child a fussy
[34.28 - 37.68] eater a lot of children from a very
[35.96 - 39.28] young age eat only one type of food and
[37.68 - 40.36] then parents get into the stage where
[39.28 - 42.44] you know what at least they're eating
[40.36 - 44.68] some chips or some fried foods let them
[42.44 - 47.36] eat that and I think that's the starting
[44.68 - 49.76] point of disaster for lean people that
[47.36 - 51.88] you tend to believe that you can eat
[49.76 - 54.12] these bad food while on the outside you
[51.88 - 58.16] look like a slim limousine on the inside
[54.12 - 58.16] you have a very very crappy engine
