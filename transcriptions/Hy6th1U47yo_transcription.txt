[7.56 - 12.40] do you want to lose fat without going to
[10.36 - 14.96] the gym well I work with a lot of
[12.40 - 16.60] celebrities actors film stars and common
[14.96 - 19.92] people that walk into my nutrition
[16.60 - 22.12] clinic where I as a nutritionist advise
[19.92 - 23.88] them on the nutrition part but they
[22.12 - 25.48] always ask me how do I burn more fat
[23.88 - 28.64] without doing any exercise now here are
[25.48 - 31.64] a few tips number one research has shown
[28.64 - 34.72] that neat not on exercise adaptive
[31.64 - 37.72] thermogenesis meaning what when you do
[34.72 - 39.52] cooking cleaning mopping sweeping or
[37.72 - 42.56] just moving around your house and doing
[39.52 - 45.44] laundry and gardening the low intensity
[42.56 - 48.80] of that work your heart rate beats at a
[45.44 - 51.24] level where it utilizes more fat as a
[48.80 - 53.96] source of energy imagine your body
[51.24 - 56.52] having two batteries a carbohydrate
[53.96 - 58.76] battery and a fat battery now when you
[56.52 - 60.72] do high-intensity gym exercises you're
[58.76 - 63.28] burning more of the car carbohydrate
[60.72 - 65.68] battery and fat is like boss this is too
[63.28 - 68.52] intense for me I can't work out with
[65.68 - 70.68] this giving this fuel source however
[68.52 - 73.48] when you change the intensity of the
[70.68 - 75.64] workout drop your intensity your car
[73.48 - 78.84] battery goes down but your fat battery
[75.64 - 82.52] begins to increase now this is where you
[78.84 - 85.16] get more substrate utilization from fat
[82.52 - 87.44] as a source of energy meaning your fat
[85.16 - 90.24] battery kicks in chances of you burning
[87.44 - 92.24] more fat is there I would recommend you
[90.24 - 95.16] to do walking because it's a low
[92.24 - 98.00] intensity activity and a sustained
[95.16 - 100.80] duration of Beyond 10,000 steps a day
[98.00 - 103.76] will help you burn more than 30 G of fat
[100.80 - 107.24] a day 30 G because people are like I
[103.76 - 110.64] want to lose 1 kg in 1 week you need to
[107.24 - 113.48] increase the increment of walking to go
[110.64 - 116.08] beyond 30 G of fat burning a day below
[113.48 - 118.44] 10,000 steps you do not cross the 30 G
[116.08 - 120.52] of fat burning per day so keep this in
[118.44 - 123.16] mind now how do you do walk walking you
[120.52 - 125.68] could do walking in one shot 10,000
[123.16 - 127.28] steps is roughly around 10 km of walking
[125.68 - 128.92] which will take you about 1 hour 40
[127.28 - 131.12] minutes if you're short and if you're
[128.92 - 133.20] tall it should take you about 1 hour 20
[131.12 - 136.00] minutes let's say now who has time to
[133.20 - 138.64] walk for so much so break it up do 15
[136.00 - 140.24] minutes of walking after your first meal
[138.64 - 142.08] do 15 minutes of walking after your
[140.24 - 144.28] lunch do 15 minutes of walking after
[142.08 - 146.88] your dinner you've got 45 minutes of
[144.28 - 148.40] walking there now walk and talk whenever
[146.88 - 150.84] you're doing phone calls with your loved
[148.40 - 153.60] ones business calls I do meetings with
[150.84 - 155.48] my key strategic team and they're like
[153.60 - 157.36] okay sir's on the Rampage right now he
[155.48 - 159.68] wants to do a walking meeting and we do
[157.36 - 161.12] a 20 30 minute walking meeting and
[159.68 - 163.20] before you know it you've got a lot of
[161.12 - 166.08] steps the other thing you could also do
[163.20 - 168.32] is get a standing desk so behind me over
[166.08 - 170.68] here I have a standing desk as well as a
[168.32 - 173.28] sitting desk so sometimes some of my
[170.68 - 174.88] online meetings I will stand up I'll
[173.28 - 176.68] have my headphones on and I'm like you
[174.88 - 180.08] know moving a little bit and stuff like
[176.68 - 182.36] that so I'm creating movement which
[180.08 - 184.28] doesn't raise my heart rate so high and
[182.36 - 187.00] therefore I'm utilizing my fat as a
[184.28 - 189.72] source of energy my second tip to you is
[187.00 - 191.88] I also advise cold showers on a daily
[189.72 - 195.60] basis because research is showing that
[191.88 - 198.36] the cold receptors activate Brown fat in
[195.60 - 200.32] your body which will burn more fat so
[198.36 - 202.52] every day I have a cold shower in the
[200.32 - 205.24] morning the cold receptors are on your
[202.52 - 207.28] face if you don't have patience or The
[205.24 - 210.60] Bravery to do cold showers every morning
[207.28 - 213.72] get a nice big salad bowl or a or a
[210.60 - 215.76] fruit bowl and fill it with ice and dip
[213.72 - 220.44] your head in it and hold it in there and
[215.76 - 223.24] go I blow bubbles okay uh for about 4 to
[220.44 - 224.76] 10 seconds maybe if you can go more than
[223.24 - 227.44] 10 seconds you might get a brain freeze
[224.76 - 230.52] so be careful come out do a little bit
[227.44 - 233.72] of calm deep
[230.52 - 235.64] breathing Because deep breaths activate
[233.72 - 237.52] the parasympathetic nervous system so
[235.64 - 239.28] combination of the cold and the
[237.52 - 241.76] structured breathing and when you put
[239.28 - 244.80] your face in once you go in 3 to five
[241.76 - 247.36] times with small breaks in between of 30
[244.80 - 250.48] seconds to 1 minute this could be a form
[247.36 - 252.48] of um what I call is a salad bowl plune
[250.48 - 255.20] but you could also do a cold plune once
[252.48 - 257.48] every 10 days or maybe twice a month
[255.20 - 260.64] wherein you immerse yourself into a nice
[257.48 - 263.68] bathtub filled with ice and it need not
[260.64 - 265.88] be too cold maybe just a 2 kg bag of ice
[263.68 - 268.20] with cold water in that btub should get
[265.88 - 270.12] you to the levels you start shivering
[268.20 - 273.12] and stuff like that so that should help
[270.12 - 274.40] you um set yourself on a pathway also if
[273.12 - 276.72] you have inflammation because you're
[274.40 - 279.12] working out walking so much uh it helps
[276.72 - 280.88] your body heal faster making you feel
[279.12 - 283.20] like a million bucks and
[280.88 - 286.52] rejuvenated the third point in addition
[283.20 - 288.32] to all of this is take up a sport or
[286.52 - 290.72] play with your kids that's very
[288.32 - 292.92] important like I did Karate when I was
[290.72 - 295.64] very young I've taken up Karate back
[292.92 - 298.32] again I've moved it to do three times a
[295.64 - 300.16] week of karate if you did yoga yoga is
[298.32 - 302.80] amazing the resting heart rate is is low
[300.16 - 305.88] so it burns fat even weight training
[302.80 - 308.32] with incremented rest in between heavier
[305.88 - 310.40] weights but lesser repetitions would
[308.32 - 312.68] allow your heart rate to be in that zone
[310.40 - 316.12] where you've taken it up as a sport so
[312.68 - 318.76] when you look at getting to burn fat you
[316.12 - 321.68] want to be physically moving and it
[318.76 - 325.16] could be in a sport that you love final
[321.68 - 328.12] Point work with your physiotherapist or
[325.16 - 330.64] biomechanics expert as you grow older
[328.12 - 333.36] you will lose muscle muscle is the
[330.64 - 336.00] singular fat burning machine it is the
[333.36 - 339.16] secret fat burning machine when your
[336.00 - 343.48] muscle gets older it gets weaker so
[339.16 - 346.44] develop the necessary Awareness on which
[343.48 - 349.36] muscles in your body need to be loaded
[346.44 - 351.24] and which muscles need to be flexible
[349.36 - 353.76] this will enable you to have better
[351.24 - 356.36] balances when you're doing the sport or
[353.76 - 358.72] walking on a daily basis above all I
[356.36 - 361.76] always tell people control your taste
[358.72 - 364.28] buds because that is the chief temperat
[361.76 - 367.52] in your body that's causing you to gain
[364.28 - 369.56] fat do a blood test once or twice every
[367.52 - 372.92] year and look for the markers that are
[369.56 - 376.68] causing you to put on weight chiefly fat
[372.92 - 379.80] those could be vitamin D vitamin B12 the
[376.68 - 382.24] vitamin B complexes look at lipoprotein
[379.80 - 384.52] A lipoprotein B and all the lipid or
[382.24 - 387.04] cholesterol markers these are clear
[384.52 - 389.64] indications that your diet as well as
[387.04 - 391.96] your liver is producing more amount of
[389.64 - 394.36] fatty acids and that also could have a
[391.96 - 398.44] detrimental effect on your health above
[394.36 - 401.28] all eat clean stay organic as much as
[398.44 - 403.36] possible breathe deeply that's very very
[401.28 - 405.68] important and enjoy life you have only
[403.36 - 408.88] one body it's the most expensive real
