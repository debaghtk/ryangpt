[33.60 - 38.84] to 8% of muscle mass per decade women

[120.80 - 124.68] very fit guy you've been my client for a
[123.08 - 127.56] long period of time you've done your
[124.68 - 130.16] diet nutrition but I've never asked you
[127.56 - 133.24] this question why did you get into this
[130.16 - 135.60] world of being a fitness influencer Guru
[133.24 - 137.52] and even having a world-class business
[135.60 - 141.44] about it so what's the story where did
[137.52 - 144.28] it start it actually started u quite
[141.44 - 147.16] early uh when I was growing up uh we
[144.28 - 148.80] were living in a joint family and my
[147.16 - 150.88] dad's younger brother used to be a great
[148.80 - 152.80] table tennis player we had a table at
[150.88 - 154.96] home and every day in the evening some
[152.80 - 157.28] 15 20 office friends would come home and
[154.96 - 159.04] the vibe used to be once again 15 20
[157.28 - 160.80] people would come into your house to
[159.04 - 162.64] play table tennis they would play for 3
[160.80 - 164.36] to four hours right and all the kids
[162.64 - 167.72] would be watching this yeah all the kids
[164.36 - 169.36] would be watching and playing also so we
[167.72 - 171.56] had no option than to you know just pick
[169.36 - 173.72] up the B bat and play because playing a
[171.56 - 175.60] sport was so glamorized uh back in the
[173.72 - 176.92] days in my house so that is where it
[175.60 - 178.76] actually started and table tennis is a
[176.92 - 180.60] fast sport requires a lot of agility and
[178.76 - 182.52] things like that so it's started there I
[180.60 - 186.08] picked up table tennis so my fitness
[182.52 - 188.92] journey started with playing a sport and
[186.08 - 190.88] then U uh because I had an opportunity
[188.92 - 192.44] of playing with people at home there
[190.88 - 195.16] were many good players who were coming
[192.44 - 198.00] to my house so I just got into playing
[195.16 - 200.12] table tennis well and was the icsc
[198.00 - 202.44] champion at some point very early uh in
[200.12 - 205.16] my school days then later I picked up
[202.44 - 207.64] basketball uh loved that sport played
[205.16 - 209.28] that for many years in Junior School uh
[207.64 - 212.40] so for many many years I was just
[209.28 - 214.88] playing Sports what also happened I
[212.40 - 218.12] started lifting weights around the age
[214.88 - 221.80] of 14 and that was a very different
[218.12 - 223.16] story so I was a very skinny kid uh and
[221.80 - 226.40] because of that I was subject to
[223.16 - 227.80] bullying and a lot of body shaming and
[226.40 - 229.68] uh you know all kind of unpleasant
[227.80 - 232.16] experiences especially to do with how
[229.68 - 234.96] you look so I wasn't very happy about
[232.16 - 237.68] where was this which part of India uh I
[234.96 - 240.24] I'm from North India I was born in Agra
[237.68 - 242.48] uh I studied in partly nital partly in
[240.24 - 245.40] theun a little bit in Agra so it was all
[242.48 - 247.24] in all uh those places uh so quite a bit
[245.40 - 249.04] of uh you know un pleas experiences
[247.24 - 250.56] happened and uh someone told me that if
[249.04 - 252.52] you go and start lifting weights it'll
[250.56 - 254.72] probably help you bulk up uh because
[252.52 - 256.12] that's what happens and it'll maybe help
[254.72 - 257.96] you in what you want to achieve so what
[256.12 - 261.08] is the starting point in this lifting
[257.96 - 262.64] weights like it was on small dingy gym
[261.08 - 263.76] in the school or in the city or
[262.64 - 266.64] something like that yeah so it was a
[263.76 - 270.32] very small uh very small gym in the city
[266.64 - 273.72] in in derun and my first experience at
[270.32 - 275.72] the gym was quite bad so I went I was
[273.72 - 277.76] very skinny I had a lot of experience in
[275.72 - 280.88] playing a sport but lifting weights
[277.76 - 283.04] nowhere close to uh doing that and in
[280.88 - 285.48] the first session uh the trainer pushed
[283.04 - 286.88] me quite hard and I couldn't I didn't
[285.48 - 288.56] know how to lift weights so I just
[286.88 - 291.08] couldn't do it very well and at the end
[288.56 - 294.52] of the session he told
[291.08 - 297.44] me it hurt my ego the next day I was so
[294.52 - 299.28] sore that I also got a fever I'm sensing
[297.44 - 303.32] I'm sensing you know if you go back and
[299.28 - 305.04] you Time Capsule this is where when you
[303.32 - 307.28] decided to start your fitness journey
[305.04 - 309.20] this thought was in your head don't over
[307.28 - 311.40] push people in their first workout
[309.20 - 313.84] exactly so this trainer over pushed you
[311.40 - 316.24] and then what happened then I was uh I
[313.84 - 317.80] just couldn't whatever he was ask me to
[316.24 - 321.56] do I couldn't do that much so he just
[317.80 - 325.04] told me this is not for you uh not in a
[321.56 - 326.80] very rude way it did hurt my ego uh went
[325.04 - 328.84] home wasn't very happy about it next day
[326.80 - 330.80] I got fever because of so excessive
[328.84 - 332.48] soreness and excessive fatigue and then
[330.80 - 335.56] I thought maybe lifting weights is not
[332.48 - 337.96] for me done but then at some point later
[335.56 - 339.40] another 6 or 7 months or so my brother
[337.96 - 341.88] my younger brother who still works with
[339.40 - 344.16] me uh he told me just give it one more
[341.88 - 347.44] shot so there was another gym called
[344.16 - 350.12] Power Pack gym in in theun and we've
[347.44 - 352.64] walked into that gym uh it was 400
[350.12 - 355.00] rupees a month of membership very
[352.64 - 357.36] expensive for me at that point uh then I
[355.00 - 359.16] thought Let It Be anyways this is not
[357.36 - 360.72] for me I've been told he said no let's
[359.16 - 362.96] do it let's let's let's give it one more
[360.72 - 365.44] shot okay and then I started going to
[362.96 - 368.52] the gym the first day I walked in saw a
[365.44 - 371.08] bunch of bulky very muscular guys guys I
[368.52 - 373.64] was intimidated but then all of them
[371.08 - 375.44] were so helpful they taught me you know
[373.64 - 377.88] how to go about you were still about 14
[375.44 - 380.72] 15 years of age I was still 14 14 years
[377.88 - 382.48] of age to be precise uh they were like
[380.72 - 384.52] very helpful they you know taught me the
[382.48 - 386.24] right kind of movements they also told
[384.52 - 388.48] me not to go crazy about it they told me
[386.24 - 390.72] a little bit about uh nutrition at that
[388.48 - 392.96] time I mean nutrition advices were just
[390.72 - 394.48] flowing uh a little all over the place
[392.96 - 396.64] but whatever they knew they were helping
[394.48 - 398.80] me out with it what I took away from it
[396.64 - 400.92] is just eat a lot of food so I did that
[398.80 - 403.92] I lifted weights and I started bulking
[400.92 - 405.64] up all of that happened uh and
[403.92 - 407.36] throughout so many years I've been
[405.64 - 408.48] through those journeys of gaining weight
[407.36 - 411.08] losing weight and all of that has
[408.48 - 413.64] happened with me but that is not
[411.08 - 416.32] important what is important is that
[413.64 - 418.48] weightlifting was something that came as
[416.32 - 422.20] magical to me actually a personal
[418.48 - 424.52] transformation experience not from the
[422.20 - 427.92] point of view of how I look but from the
[424.52 - 429.68] point of view of how I feel and then I
[427.92 - 431.40] decided that I'm never going back this
[429.68 - 434.16] is something that I just want to do for
[431.40 - 437.44] the rest of my life so I continued uh
[434.16 - 440.24] lifting weights awesome so you know
[437.44 - 443.04] somebody didn't inspire you then a group
[440.24 - 445.68] of muscular guys inspiring you you were
[443.04 - 447.92] young you were impressionable and then
[445.68 - 449.24] featuring yourself to understand that
[447.92 - 450.20] this is something that gave you a good
[449.24 - 452.32] wife
[450.20 - 455.00] and it's not about looks but it's about
[452.32 - 457.48] how you feel so wonderful words of
[455.00 - 459.68] wisdom U obviously this journey that you
[457.48 - 461.76] started when very young in terms of
[459.68 - 464.16] weightlifting today you are one of the
[461.76 - 467.92] co-founders of one of the largest chains
[464.16 - 469.64] in the world of gyms and health clubs
[467.92 - 471.60] tell us a little bit about your cult
[469.64 - 473.92] field story where did that start so you
[471.60 - 473.92] obviously
[477.52 - 485.00] gyedu 2009 is when I finished my MBA and
[481.84 - 487.00] I started working in one of the biggest
[485.00 - 489.12] home and personal care brand in the
[487.00 - 490.76] world in sales and marketing a great
[489.12 - 493.36] experience I worked there for 2 years
[490.76 - 495.20] learned a lot but since it was in sales
[493.36 - 497.80] I was you know an fmcg I was out there
[495.20 - 500.68] on the road a lot uh while that was
[497.80 - 502.44] happening I was eating food outside not
[500.68 - 504.96] the best food uh from a health
[502.44 - 509.52] standpoint My Lifestyle was all over the
[504.96 - 511.92] place uh so from from being very fit I
[509.52 - 515.16] realize that I've started to gain weight
[511.92 - 516.96] uh and my lifestyle is you know it's not
[515.16 - 519.92] healthy it's it's actually very
[516.96 - 521.68] unhealthy so I wanted to make some
[519.92 - 523.72] change while I could really see myself
[521.68 - 526.64] growing in that job but I thought my
[523.72 - 528.64] health uh and my fitness is something
[526.64 - 531.20] that has done so much for me so far
[528.64 - 532.60] whatever I am is because you know I've
[531.20 - 534.16] been into health and fitness because
[532.60 - 535.92] that gave me the confidence to do
[534.16 - 537.72] anything at all so I need to do
[535.92 - 540.64] something about it so I started looking
[537.72 - 543.00] for another job where I could being a uh
[540.64 - 544.64] you know sit in an office and work still
[543.00 - 547.96] wanted to create the right kind of
[544.64 - 550.52] impact but I wanted u a very different
[547.96 - 552.08] workplace for myself fortunately got a
[550.52 - 555.52] job here in Bangalore so that was in
[552.08 - 557.52] 2011 I moved to Bangalore worked here
[555.52 - 559.84] for 4 and 1/2 years in
[557.52 - 563.08] corporate but during those 4 and a half
[559.84 - 565.28] years I got to travel a lot to different
[563.08 - 567.56] countries mostly in Europe so I used to
[565.28 - 569.64] go for assignments where I would stay in
[567.56 - 573.48] Amsterdam for 3 months or Finland for 3
[569.64 - 575.96] months work there and while I was there
[573.48 - 577.84] I just found strike good amount of work
[575.96 - 581.32] life balance because of how people used
[577.84 - 583.12] to work there uh and I got access to
[581.32 - 585.92] some really good Fitness options so I
[583.12 - 589.04] got exposed to uh Brazilian jitu while I
[585.92 - 591.52] was in Amsterdam and because I came from
[589.04 - 593.88] a sporting background I just picked up
[591.52 - 595.72] the sport quite fast and Brazilian jitu
[593.88 - 597.84] is quite skillful it's got a lot of
[595.72 - 600.24] grappling and you can't just loosen
[597.84 - 602.20] yourself up while you are uh uh
[600.24 - 604.32] grappling with somebody because the
[602.20 - 606.64] moment you do it you're gone you you'll
[604.32 - 608.40] have to tap it out so from a fitness
[606.64 - 610.80] standpoint really good sport so I
[608.40 - 612.88] started doing Jitsu then I got exposed
[610.80 - 615.04] to CrossFit while I was in one of those
[612.88 - 617.40] places and then I realized that you know
[615.04 - 618.80] going versus going to a gym uh where
[617.40 - 620.92] there are machines and things like that
[618.80 - 623.08] nothing against it I right now you know
[620.92 - 625.48] as of this morning I lifted uh weights
[623.08 - 627.24] on on the machine that's really good but
[625.48 - 629.36] then CrossFit was very differentiated
[627.24 - 631.84] for me at that point it also allowed me
[629.36 - 635.12] me to uh work out at a pace that I love
[631.84 - 638.04] to work out at at that point so had I
[635.12 - 641.64] just started going deeper into uh the
[638.04 - 643.36] science of Fitness because just from uh
[641.64 - 646.12] coming from the point of view that this
[643.36 - 648.28] is something that I love to do a lot so
[646.12 - 650.56] I did a bunch of courses I started
[648.28 - 652.84] taking time off and you know go to thail
[650.56 - 655.20] Thailand for 3 weeks and just train do
[652.84 - 656.92] muai and lift weights and and nothing
[655.20 - 658.88] else while I was doing all of that I
[656.92 - 662.96] just thought that this is something that
[658.88 - 664.92] I love to do if and I know that this is
[662.96 - 667.36] something where I can create a lot of
[664.92 - 669.88] impact because if people are healthy if
[667.36 - 671.56] they are fit they will be happier there
[669.88 - 672.80] will be more productivity around and
[671.56 - 674.60] there will be better relationships
[672.80 - 677.04] around so this using health and fitness
[674.60 - 678.56] as an as an anchor can really help me do
[677.04 - 680.92] help me create the kind of impact that I
[678.56 - 682.64] want to create in this world so I
[680.92 - 685.24] thought that let me quit my full-time

[709.32 - 712.68] supportive they were supportive they
[710.40 - 714.36] were supportive yeah in fact I mean I
[712.68 - 716.72] got a lot of help from my family when I
[714.36 - 719.40] was starting the first cult Center okay
[716.72 - 720.84] I got a lot of help uh from my from my
[719.40 - 723.08] so they knew you were passionate about
[720.84 - 725.88] Fitness even in your younger days yeah
[723.08 - 728.72] 100% in fact my mother was she's been
[725.88 - 730.84] into fitness a lot I keep posting about
[728.72 - 732.52] her on my Instagram and she lifts uh
[730.84 - 735.00] heavy weights right now but her fitness
[732.52 - 737.36] journey also goes uh way back so we were
[735.00 - 740.76] very inspired by uh you know what we'
[737.36 - 743.20] seen at home because I felt so
[740.76 - 745.32] passionately about becoming a fitness
[743.20 - 746.72] professional there was a lot of support
[745.32 - 749.16] uh from the family so being very
[746.72 - 750.84] fortunate from that point of view so you
[749.16 - 753.40] deed to become a fitness trainer in
[750.84 - 756.44] which city and at what timeline so
[753.40 - 759.92] actually started to get into deeper into
[756.44 - 761.52] fitness around 2012 2013 started doing
[759.92 - 764.60] courses started started teaching
[761.52 - 766.76] part-time uh in different places uh not
[764.60 - 769.24] for money just for experience I had a
[766.76 - 770.96] job and uh money was not the top of mind
[769.24 - 773.16] the top of Mind was learning and
[770.96 - 776.00] experience uh working with people in
[773.16 - 777.64] Fitness uh in that process I also you
[776.00 - 779.56] know got a lot of mentorship from
[777.64 - 781.04] coaches in different parts of the World
[779.56 - 783.92] some of them helped me set up the first
[781.04 - 785.52] cult Center here uh their facilities
[783.92 - 787.40] became the inspiration for the first
[785.52 - 789.24] cult Center that I had set up so the
[787.40 - 792.00] first center that I put up in
[789.24 - 793.32] sarjapur was a warehouse and if you go
[792.00 - 795.32] to Thailand you'll see a lot of
[793.32 - 797.36] Warehouse gym so the inspiration was
[795.32 - 798.40] coming from different places where IID
[797.36 - 802.16] uh where I
[798.40 - 806.44] trained so 2015 is when I decided to
[802.16 - 809.60] quit full-time and start uh the first
[806.44 - 811.36] cult Center May 2015 is when we had
[809.60 - 812.92] started it out how did you find the
[811.36 - 815.80] first place cuz there are a lot of
[812.92 - 817.64] people out there who are into fitness
[815.80 - 820.40] and you know they're like What's his
[817.64 - 822.44] story I know how did you find your first
[820.40 - 823.40] warehouse and did you have enough money
[822.44 - 826.00] for a
[823.40 - 827.96] deposit uh didn't have enough money for
[826.00 - 830.84] uh uh for the investment that had to
[827.96 - 832.60] happen uh so the place we found was not
[830.84 - 835.68] a warehouse it was an empty piece of
[832.60 - 838.32] land we created that from scratch we are
[835.68 - 840.24] still running that Center um so I would
[838.32 - 843.20] that Center is very
[840.24 - 846.04] it's like your first baby basically
[843.20 - 849.28] exactly correct so the how I found it
[846.04 - 852.44] was I just get on a bike and just go
[849.28 - 854.88] around and see where there are uh places
[852.44 - 857.04] boards boards or or anything that I can
[854.88 - 858.68] find I didn't want to get a broker
[857.04 - 860.72] because you would have to pay that much
[858.68 - 862.56] money to pay and I didn't want to pay
[860.72 - 865.32] that kind of money at that time so I
[862.56 - 867.68] just go on the bike and uh fortunately
[865.32 - 869.84] the security person in the building
[867.68 - 872.28] where I was staying knew uh someone who
[869.84 - 874.96] owns a piece of land um a little on the
[872.28 - 876.80] inside typically if you see gyms are on
[874.96 - 879.12] you know main roads and all so that
[876.80 - 880.76] there is visibility but then rental
[879.12 - 882.96] disadvantage I've always thought about
[880.76 - 885.16] that I don't think your gym needs to be
[882.96 - 887.00] on the main road in today's day and age
[885.16 - 889.72] because you have got social media and
[887.00 - 891.96] when you see one fit guy he will tell 10
[889.72 - 894.48] people where he goes to train I agree
[891.96 - 896.04] with you yes so wow wonderful so you've
[894.48 - 898.56] went on your bike and I'm seeing you
[896.04 - 900.20] driving your bike and you're going and
[898.56 - 903.08] uh okay you find you found this off
[900.20 - 904.52] thebeat uh place and then what happened
[903.08 - 906.56] uh then just negotiated with the
[904.52 - 908.28] landlord and said we want to open a gym
[906.56 - 910.76] here he was confused what kind of a gym
[908.28 - 912.52] will you open you know here in this Lane
[910.76 - 914.36] uh and it was just a plot of land it was
[912.52 - 916.76] an empty piece of piece of land we
[914.36 - 920.48] cleared it off did the foundation and we
[916.76 - 924.24] built that fabricated uh structure uh
[920.48 - 925.92] the landord was like fine do it I don't
[924.24 - 928.00] really see this working out but if you
[925.92 - 931.00] want to do it do it we got at a pretty
[928.00 - 932.72] competitive rent because it was inside
[931.00 - 935.52] uh the landlord wasn't planning to do
[932.72 - 938.24] much with that piece of land so uh the
[935.52 - 940.56] rentals were quite good and that was and
[938.24 - 942.36] you continue to be there today we we
[940.56 - 943.84] still run we still run that facility we
[942.36 - 946.80] have many other centers now in and
[943.84 - 950.08] around that area uh but we still run uh
[946.80 - 952.32] that facility so I had a great rent
[950.08 - 954.00] Advantage I could the money that I was
[952.32 - 956.28] saving in rent I could use that money to
[954.00 - 957.76] get some coaches from other countries so
[956.28 - 959.92] some of the best people that I had
[957.76 - 963.60] trained with for the first center for
[959.92 - 966.72] the first few months I got them from
[963.60 - 968.52] those places to to Bangalore uh took up
[966.72 - 970.36] a flat on rent for all of them so they
[968.52 - 972.24] have a comfortable stay here so there
[970.36 - 975.08] were people for example there there were
[972.24 - 977.76] two coaches from Thailand both of them
[975.08 - 979.52] could not speak Hindi or English or they
[977.76 - 981.52] could just speak Tha but they were
[979.52 - 985.16] brilliant in what they did so they would
[981.52 - 988.16] take their muai sessions in their
[985.16 - 990.40] language but people here understood
[988.16 - 992.32] everything they said because it was just
[990.40 - 994.56] coming from the heart and there was
[992.32 - 996.08] people respected those coaches so much
[994.56 - 997.76] people just listen to all their
[996.08 - 1000.44] instructions patiently and they were all
[997.76 - 1002.80] getting better at at the sport and at at
[1000.44 - 1005.20] Fitness so that is that is how it all so
[1002.80 - 1009.28] it goes to say that if your heart and
[1005.20 - 1012.12] mind is in Fitness no matter the type of
[1009.28 - 1013.84] Fitness uh you will connect and I think
[1012.12 - 1016.24] this is an important point that you're
[1013.84 - 1018.64] making which is that a lot of people
[1016.24 - 1021.88] enter into fitness with this sole weight
[1018.64 - 1024.24] loss goal in mind yeah which is in my
[1021.88 - 1027.24] opinion arriving from a place of
[1024.24 - 1029.04] negativity you're unhappy with your body
[1027.24 - 1031.00] therefore you might be unhappy with this
[1029.04 - 1032.72] Fitness activity taking up but what
[1031.00 - 1034.88] you're telling me is when these coaches
[1032.72 - 1038.24] came in and in spite of a language
[1034.88 - 1040.32] barrier people took up the training and
[1038.24 - 1044.28] loved it and they were able to progress
[1040.32 - 1048.00] forward how did you go from one gym a
[1044.28 - 1050.28] few formats so you had maai I'm I'm I'm
[1048.00 - 1053.12] I'm presuming Brazilian jiu-jitsu was
[1050.28 - 1055.08] there maybe some CrossFit was there what
[1053.12 - 1057.16] else was there in the first format so
[1055.08 - 1058.88] when we started it was were the dumbells
[1057.16 - 1060.44] in your gym there there were dumbbells
[1058.88 - 1062.68] there were there were barbells and there
[1060.44 - 1064.92] was a boxing ring uh there were no
[1062.68 - 1067.08] machines though and there was the people
[1064.92 - 1070.12] used to walk and it was very different
[1067.08 - 1071.92] uh because of it was very first of all
[1070.12 - 1074.32] it's a warehouse and then it's an open
[1071.92 - 1076.84] space there are climbing ropes and there
[1074.32 - 1079.40] is a boxing ring there are dumbbells Etc
[1076.84 - 1081.12] but there are no machines inquiries
[1079.40 - 1082.64] would come in and they used to ask it's
[1081.12 - 1085.68] great whatever you told me I loved it
[1082.64 - 1088.48] your trainers are super fit uh I can see
[1085.68 - 1088.48] people are enjoying
[1089.60 - 1092.92] here that was
[1097.96 - 1102.92] the we used we were running boxing
[1100.16 - 1106.16] classes it's like intense cardio for
[1102.92 - 1109.40] it's even worse uh in fact um if I can
[1106.16 - 1112.92] share with you and your viewers I think
[1109.40 - 1114.56] basically skiing karate and boxing have
[1112.92 - 1117.04] the highest calorie burn when I start
[1114.56 - 1118.64] planning a diet chart wow so it's not
[1117.04 - 1121.04] treadmill running at the end of the day
[1118.64 - 1123.04] you know but okay so you had this and
[1121.04 - 1125.84] people
[1123.04 - 1127.60] tread were you getting scared key was
[1125.84 - 1130.80] membership really good so you were able
[1127.60 - 1135.48] to sustain so we were u i mean while
[1130.80 - 1138.12] people had these questions uh we were
[1135.48 - 1141.32] like mean we giving trial classes for
[1138.12 - 1141.32] free there's no in doing
[1142.12 - 1146.60] it if you want to go to the gym that is
[1145.28 - 1148.12] just down the lane here that has
[1146.60 - 1150.48] treadmills and all kind of machines you
[1148.12 - 1152.00] may need it's also cheaper than you know
[1150.48 - 1153.24] much cheaper than the kind of membership
[1152.00 - 1155.68] that we are charging for but we are
[1153.24 - 1159.64] charging for coaching our people who
[1155.68 - 1162.20] train here have done their art for more
[1159.64 - 1165.36] than 20 years at least there's a there
[1162.20 - 1168.16] was a coach that we had 25 years of age
[1165.36 - 1169.80] his total muai experience was 21 years
[1168.16 - 1171.92] so he started started training at the
[1169.80 - 1174.44] age of four he started fighting in
[1171.92 - 1176.88] Thailand at the age of six fighting as
[1174.44 - 1178.80] in in the ring so that's the kind of
[1176.88 - 1179.84] experience that people were coming with
[1178.80 - 1181.68] that's the kind of passion that they
[1179.84 - 1183.96] were coming does cult still have the
[1181.68 - 1186.64] muai classes today we don't we don't do
[1183.96 - 1189.92] muai right now we've we over a period of
[1186.64 - 1192.20] time uh we zeroed down on what works for
[1189.92 - 1194.04] the Indian audience basically so what's
[1192.20 - 1196.32] working for India today I understand you
[1194.04 - 1198.12] have hundreds of gyms so your cult field
[1196.32 - 1199.64] centers have evolved let's not call them
[1198.12 - 1202.40] gyms the centers have evolved your
[1199.64 - 1204.24] Fitness Studios have evolved so what's
[1202.40 - 1206.56] what's the formats that are available if
[1204.24 - 1209.32] somebody wants to do a training so right
[1206.56 - 1211.08] now uh so we have two kind of we also
[1209.32 - 1214.48] have gyms and it's a pretty large
[1211.08 - 1217.04] footprint for us right now uh group
[1214.48 - 1220.16] class is what we started with within the
[1217.04 - 1223.00] group class uh centers we have uh
[1220.16 - 1226.24] strength and conditioning and we have HX
[1223.00 - 1228.20] workout which we created with Rik rosan
[1226.24 - 1231.80] uh that is where people predominantly
[1228.20 - 1234.20] lift weights and uh the footfall in
[1231.80 - 1237.60] those formats is quite quite good people
[1234.20 - 1239.52] are loving lifting weights uh there are
[1237.60 - 1241.24] so many people I know who are who are
[1239.52 - 1243.32] starting their weight training Journey
[1241.24 - 1247.00] with these formats uh then there is
[1243.32 - 1249.36] Dance Fitness uh again another top
[1247.00 - 1251.08] favorite of our members it's so much fun
[1249.36 - 1254.16] you you know there's music our trainers
[1251.08 - 1255.80] are great uh that mosphere is amazing uh
[1254.16 - 1258.36] so Dance Fitness is is there it
[1255.80 - 1260.00] continues to be a great format for us uh
[1258.36 - 1262.56] and and then we have yoga because we
[1260.00 - 1264.24] also need to focus on recovery and
[1262.56 - 1266.20] improving their Mobility stability
[1264.24 - 1268.80] balance and everything uh and we have
[1266.20 - 1271.12] boxing so these are our all in all these
[1268.80 - 1273.52] are the major formats that we've zeroed
[1271.12 - 1275.80] down on over last so many years so when
[1273.52 - 1278.96] did you know that you're going to go
[1275.80 - 1281.56] from a one cult fit Center to hundreds
[1278.96 - 1283.08] how did that Journey happen uh was it
[1281.56 - 1285.12] family and friends that came in and gave
[1283.08 - 1287.24] you a lot of cash and then you started
[1285.12 - 1288.96] or your employees invested or there was
[1287.24 - 1290.48] that one person that you met along the
[1288.96 - 1293.96] way that just you know said okay let's
[1290.48 - 1295.64] do this so initially it was to set up
[1293.96 - 1296.96] the first center it was a lot of help
[1295.64 - 1300.48] from the
[1296.96 - 1303.56] family I requested my sister to invest
[1300.48 - 1307.92] in the uh first center she agreed and
[1303.56 - 1310.72] she did that uh I asked my wife to that
[1307.92 - 1312.08] I'm going to live off her salary she
[1310.72 - 1313.36] said fine I think all of us have done
[1312.08 - 1315.20] that some point me also is an
[1313.36 - 1317.92] entrepreneur I remember the first year
[1315.20 - 1320.56] my entire salary was paid by by my wife
[1317.92 - 1322.40] when we started business bues yeah so
[1320.56 - 1324.44] that and then I had some savings so I
[1322.40 - 1326.20] thought let me make sure that I have no
[1324.44 - 1328.16] I'm and you had you didn't have your
[1326.20 - 1330.36] baby by then right this was long time I
[1328.16 - 1331.76] was very recently married uh just one
[1330.36 - 1334.48] year back I had gotten married what did
[1331.76 - 1337.16] your in-laws think about you starting a
[1334.48 - 1339.52] he was a MBA guy working for a topshot
[1337.16 - 1341.52] company consultancy company and now
[1339.52 - 1344.24] suddenly he's opening up as a gym you
[1341.52 - 1345.88] know people think Gym trainer right so
[1344.24 - 1347.76] was there any resistance from your
[1345.88 - 1349.48] in-law side and no I think they were
[1347.76 - 1351.88] they were pretty chilled out about it so
[1349.48 - 1353.44] they're like fine I mean I I've never
[1351.88 - 1356.72] had that discussion with them but I'm
[1353.44 - 1359.24] sure ASA had uh but I I think they were
[1356.72 - 1361.96] like whatever you guys are happy doing
[1359.24 - 1363.36] do it we've done our part so so so you
[1361.96 - 1366.12] know you're taking your bike and
[1363.36 - 1368.92] searching in the B Lanes to find this
[1366.12 - 1374.32] gym how did it happen that you know you
[1368.92 - 1377.48] got uh expanding yeah so um then very
[1374.32 - 1380.44] fortunately I met Mukesh bunel the
[1377.48 - 1382.84] Mukesh bunel Mukesh bansel uh I he was
[1380.44 - 1384.68] one of our first few members so for

[1395.32 - 1401.48] the first uh cult Center so there's a
[1397.72 - 1403.28] lake we open opposite a lake and at that
[1401.48 - 1405.68] Lake a lot of people come there for
[1403.28 - 1407.20] running and Mukesh also used to come
[1405.68 - 1409.76] there regularly to run and walk and
[1407.20 - 1412.60] things so he just saw this and saw you
[1409.76 - 1414.88] know our it's look looks like that these
[1412.60 - 1416.72] people are doing MMA and boxing and
[1414.88 - 1420.40] they're doing something which is uh
[1416.72 - 1422.60] different very fit person uh very very
[1420.40 - 1424.76] driven from you know uh from a workout
[1422.60 - 1427.96] standpoint so he just walked in uh I
[1424.76 - 1430.60] took his trial session and U he bought
[1427.96 - 1433.40] the membership over a period of that
[1430.60 - 1436.20] journey I just realized that uh like he
[1433.40 - 1438.72] he was very supportive U and I realized
[1436.20 - 1441.84] that if I'm just getting some time from
[1438.72 - 1444.28] him that's a big deal because most early
[1441.84 - 1445.76] uh stage entrepreneurs don't get that
[1444.28 - 1448.16] kind of
[1445.76 - 1451.44] mentorship uh he was very suppored in
[1448.16 - 1453.52] terms of mentoring me just telling me
[1451.44 - 1456.04] the best practices in terms of customer
[1453.52 - 1458.72] experience how to scale the business and
[1456.04 - 1461.88] everything else else around it so I just
[1458.72 - 1464.88] learned a lot from him and finally you
[1461.88 - 1468.76] know he decided to start a uh you know
[1464.88 - 1471.24] Healthcare uh Venture called kit and uh
[1468.76 - 1474.56] I just wanted to work with him so we we
[1471.24 - 1476.48] got talking I was anyway you know um
[1474.56 - 1478.24] working with him from from the from a
[1476.48 - 1480.16] standpoint that I was reaching out to
[1478.24 - 1482.44] him for mentorship for guidance whenever
[1480.16 - 1484.96] I needed uh he was going to help me
[1482.44 - 1487.00] scale the business uh from the outside
[1484.96 - 1491.12] to a certain extent but when curefit
[1487.00 - 1492.88] happened uh we decided to get this
[1491.12 - 1495.36] partnership to a much deeper level and
[1492.88 - 1497.72] that is when cult got acquired by kit
[1495.36 - 1500.12] and I joined the uh kit team started
[1497.72 - 1503.68] working with uh with Mukesh the thing
[1500.12 - 1506.68] was that uh Mukesh has built businesses
[1503.68 - 1508.84] in the past he is a very seasoned
[1506.68 - 1511.04] entrepreneur and he knows how to scale
[1508.84 - 1512.76] businesses that's not what I know if I
[1511.04 - 1514.12] had to scale it on my own I can
[1512.76 - 1517.96] guarantee I wouldn't have been able to
[1514.12 - 1520.12] do it but what I know is how to train
[1517.96 - 1523.52] people the right way and I could see
[1520.12 - 1526.88] this as the lifetime opportunity for me
[1523.52 - 1528.64] to be able to train millions of people I
[1526.88 - 1531.44] couldn't have done it on my own so I
[1528.64 - 1533.88] thought this while I understand right
[1531.44 - 1535.16] now I own this gym tomorrow I will not
[1533.88 - 1537.44] be the owner of this gym because I'm
[1535.16 - 1540.08] going to end up selling it but that's
[1537.44 - 1542.24] fine eventually if you create the right
[1540.08 - 1545.20] kind of impact that's it that's what we
[1542.24 - 1548.36] all need to do so I made that call and
[1545.20 - 1549.96] that is where the Journey of actual cult
[1548.36 - 1552.32] that people see right now
[1549.96 - 1554.96] started so that was one phase of your
[1552.32 - 1557.16] life where now you went you met mesh and
[1554.96 - 1559.24] you've gotten this expansion going and
[1557.16 - 1561.08] you're part of the team that sits in the
[1559.24 - 1563.68] driver's seats and says okay we want to
[1561.08 - 1566.08] make an impact on people how has it had
[1563.68 - 1568.80] an impact on your personal life now that
[1566.08 - 1571.28] cult is almost visible in every
[1568.80 - 1573.60] neighborhood across the country how is
[1571.28 - 1575.92] it that it's affected your personal life
[1573.60 - 1579.64] you recently had a baby yes about a year
[1575.92 - 1582.12] ago so becoming a father so one is you
[1579.64 - 1584.48] had the first baby which was the gym now
[1582.12 - 1586.60] you have your own baby so what's life
[1584.48 - 1589.72] and how has it changed for you yeah I
[1586.60 - 1592.28] think uh first of all has had a major
[1589.72 - 1595.28] impact on my life my life can like
[1592.28 - 1597.52] easily be divided between what was
[1595.28 - 1598.92] before cult and what is after cult I I
[1597.52 - 1600.72] know for a fact that I'm a changed
[1598.92 - 1603.16] person after that I know for a fact that
[1600.72 - 1605.44] people who know me they can just you
[1603.16 - 1607.24] know validate uh this statement that
[1605.44 - 1611.16] rishab is a change person after cult
[1607.24 - 1613.40] happened um and it's just the because I
[1611.16 - 1616.28] was so passionate about this business I
[1613.40 - 1619.16] just started spending a lot of time uh
[1616.28 - 1622.92] at the gym I also started
[1619.16 - 1625.08] to because I was around equipment and
[1622.92 - 1627.92] very fit people all the time so I just
[1625.08 - 1630.04] started working a lot on myself I also
[1627.92 - 1634.00] never had the opportunity to because we
[1630.04 - 1636.08] employ uh so many trainers uh across you
[1634.00 - 1638.64] know so so many of our centers and I
[1636.08 - 1640.68] never had the opportunity to inspire
[1638.64 - 1642.84] people the way I do right now I was
[1640.68 - 1645.48] never in a role where people would look
[1642.84 - 1648.72] up to me so it was very important for me
[1645.48 - 1651.76] to lead by example to walk the top so I
[1648.72 - 1656.40] had to really really work on myself my
[1651.76 - 1658.40] own Fitness my health uh my knowledge my
[1656.40 - 1660.52] skill upgrade Etc so I just really had
[1658.40 - 1661.72] to spend a lot of time doing all of
[1660.52 - 1663.20] those things which meant I couldn't
[1661.72 - 1665.16] spend time meeting people and
[1663.20 - 1666.72] socializing and all of that but fine
[1665.16 - 1669.60] that if that change had to happen for
[1666.72 - 1673.72] good that had to happen no regrets um on
[1669.60 - 1675.76] that U angad uh my son was born 18
[1673.72 - 1678.20] months ago and that was another
[1675.76 - 1680.76] transformative experience I just like my
[1678.20 - 1682.24] mindset just changed overnight
[1680.76 - 1685.28] everything changed for me after it
[1682.24 - 1688.88] happened in in in multiple ways he's
[1685.28 - 1691.76] just clarified the priorities uh for me
[1688.88 - 1693.28] uh again because I want to make sure I
[1691.76 - 1697.08] understand that how important health is
[1693.28 - 1699.04] in anybody's life I very strongly feel
[1697.08 - 1700.68] health and exercise and Fitness and
[1699.04 - 1701.88] Nutrition should be the top of mind for
[1700.68 - 1704.92] pretty much everybody because that
[1701.88 - 1709.28] drives everything else in your life so
[1704.92 - 1712.20] uh I and I really want angard to be
[1709.28 - 1715.64] uh following a healthy path I want him
[1712.20 - 1717.20] to probably pursue a sport I'm just I'm
[1715.64 - 1719.72] just visualizing that anger's going to
[1717.20 - 1721.72] have a table tennis in your house and
[1719.72 - 1723.12] he's going like my crazy dad's invited
[1721.72 - 1728.88] the whole neighborhood to play table
[1723.12 - 1732.08] tennis in fact uh so uh so he's never
[1728.88 - 1734.48] seen any kind of uh you know the kind of
[1732.08 - 1736.28] content that keeps floating around on on
[1734.48 - 1738.84] on on phones and iPads and all right now
[1736.28 - 1740.60] so he's not seen any of that until now
[1738.84 - 1742.64] but he sees his dad work out right he
[1740.60 - 1746.44] sees me work out and the only thing that
[1742.64 - 1749.36] he sees he's so far Seen On TV is
[1746.44 - 1752.08] Cricket so he thinks this thing is
[1749.36 - 1754.08] Cricket you know you turn it on and and
[1752.08 - 1755.36] playing Cricket so he's now he's just 18
[1754.08 - 1757.60] months old he picks up a ball he's
[1755.36 - 1759.84] trying to do some bowling actions and
[1757.60 - 1762.80] after he bowls he says how's that you
[1759.84 - 1764.44] know so so I'm just saying that I just
[1762.80 - 1766.40] want to give him the best environment
[1764.44 - 1768.96] possible so that he can make the right
[1766.40 - 1772.16] decisions uh for himself so I've just
[1768.96 - 1775.20] started again uh working a lot more on
[1772.16 - 1777.32] myself I wake up at 4:45 I finish my
[1775.20 - 1779.64] workout by what time do you go to sleep
[1777.32 - 1781.44] I sleep by so he sleeps quite early he
[1779.64 - 1783.44] would like we start winding down at 7:00
[1781.44 - 1787.44] p.m. which means our dinner is done by
[1783.44 - 1789.72] 6:30 6:45 uh wind down starts at 7:00
[1787.44 - 1792.68] 8:00 p.m. is when he sleeps off between
[1789.72 - 1795.08] 8: to 9: is when I would just sleep off
[1792.68 - 1798.08] so when he sleeps off I do my uh just
[1795.08 - 1799.60] next to him uh I do my foam rolling and
[1798.08 - 1802.00] some amount of Mobility I so you're
[1799.60 - 1803.52] you're around but he's like he's sensing
[1802.00 - 1805.52] the parents' presence and he's nodding
[1803.52 - 1807.80] off to sleep yes and then I would just
[1805.52 - 1809.48] get into bed uh put on my reading light
[1807.80 - 1812.08] read a little bit and then uh fall
[1809.48 - 1815.68] asleep so it gets to 8:30 8:45 but
[1812.08 - 1817.16] that's that's the max wake up at 4:45 uh
[1815.68 - 1820.60] uh I don't eat anything in the morning
[1817.16 - 1823.12] before workout uh because mentally I
[1820.60 - 1825.80] want to work out I want to move before I
[1823.12 - 1828.92] put anything something into uh mentally
[1825.80 - 1831.48] it just it just works better for me uh
[1828.92 - 1833.96] it just it just connects better with my
[1831.48 - 1836.12] identity for everyone out there at some
[1833.96 - 1838.24] point of your life you would have eaten
[1836.12 - 1840.84] before a workout as a trainer because
[1838.24 - 1842.80] everyone says that right but now you've
[1840.84 - 1844.56] evolved like You' evolved in your
[1842.80 - 1846.64] business you've evolved with a sun
[1844.56 - 1848.68] you've also evolved in your choices of
[1846.64 - 1851.04] eating this
[1848.68 - 1852.72] evolving how did you feel when you ate
[1851.04 - 1854.40] and worked out and how do you feel now
[1852.72 - 1856.24] without working out because I want to
[1854.40 - 1858.48] know your perspective I don't know I've
[1856.24 - 1862.32] been doing fasted workouts for a while
[1858.48 - 1864.32] now and I love my energy in the morning
[1862.32 - 1866.96] when I eat food first thing in the
[1864.32 - 1869.16] morning uh you feel sluggish I feel a
[1866.96 - 1870.76] little uh because it probably takes time
[1869.16 - 1873.60] to digest and things like that so I'm
[1870.76 - 1875.76] just better off uh using what I ate in
[1873.60 - 1877.60] dinner as my pre-workout first thing in
[1875.76 - 1879.48] the morning but for sure if I'm working
[1877.60 - 1882.84] out later in the day I'm pretty sure
[1879.48 - 1885.72] I'll need to uh need to load some food
[1882.84 - 1888.68] uh but I generally don't work out that
[1885.72 - 1890.28] late I just work out work out early you
[1888.68 - 1892.64] it's it's it's amazing that you're doing
[1890.28 - 1896.40] this because most of the clients that I
[1892.64 - 1899.00] worked with including you um they all
[1896.40 - 1900.40] evolve and they always ask what's the
[1899.00 - 1903.08] right type of workout and what's the
[1900.40 - 1905.00] right type of diet but if you dig a
[1903.08 - 1906.72] little bit deeper you'll begin to figure
[1905.00 - 1909.76] out what works for your body what is
[1906.72 - 1911.60] your bio individuality you know this
[1909.76 - 1914.76] idea that you work out so early in the
[1911.60 - 1917.04] morning to to India this is foreign you
[1914.76 - 1919.68] know getting to bed at 9:00 I don't
[1917.04 - 1921.88] think anybody on the planet does that
[1919.68 - 1924.36] right and so like how can this guy do it
[1921.88 - 1927.84] and but it's part of your life yes you
[1924.36 - 1931.00] run a very successful Fitness business
[1927.84 - 1932.92] fitness gyms and Studios open up at 5:00
[1931.00 - 1935.08] a.m. in the morning obviously you want
[1932.92 - 1937.28] to lead by example one of the leading by
[1935.08 - 1940.56] example is getting up that early in the
[1937.28 - 1943.60] morning do you take a nap in the middle
[1940.56 - 1945.04] of the day I'd love to take a nap but uh
[1943.60 - 1948.24] I'm not able to do that because I have
[1945.04 - 1950.24] to be at work uh through the day so not
[1948.24 - 1952.16] able to take a nap but weekends I do for
[1950.24 - 1954.48] sure again Ang takes a nap in the
[1952.16 - 1957.16] afternoon I just go and use that
[1954.48 - 1960.04] opportunity to you know snuggle up and
[1957.16 - 1962.92] take a nap with him uh 20 30 minutes but
[1960.04 - 1965.24] that's golden if I can do that every day
[1962.92 - 1967.80] I'd love it so now that you've
[1965.24 - 1970.20] identified your space uh with your
[1967.80 - 1973.20] family and your business you know your
[1970.20 - 1975.48] son is the center of your Universe we
[1973.20 - 1977.84] see a lot of unhealthy children you
[1975.48 - 1979.48] mentioned strongly that I want to give
[1977.84 - 1981.84] give him the best opportunity for
[1979.48 - 1984.80] fitness and that word came in very
[1981.84 - 1987.48] strongly a lot of our Indian children
[1984.80 - 1989.40] are not healthy you're a father today
[1987.48 - 1992.64] you run a very successful Fitness
[1989.40 - 1995.12] business what is your advice to India
[1992.64 - 1996.64] from their children's upbringing right
[1995.12 - 1999.24] from you know you said you put your son
[1996.64 - 2001.60] to sleep at 8:00 I used to put my son to
[1999.24 - 2004.48] sleep at 8:00 when I tell my clients put
[2001.60 - 2007.00] your children to bed early oh no 10:30
[2004.48 - 2008.60] 11: is a normal time can you give us a
[2007.00 - 2011.00] message as one of India's leading
[2008.60 - 2012.88] Fitness gurus on how important it is to
[2011.00 - 2014.76] bring up our children correctly how
[2012.88 - 2017.08] important is for parents to lead by
[2014.76 - 2018.36] example that's the most important thing
[2017.08 - 2021.04] if you think about it they are the
[2018.36 - 2024.84] future of the country they need to be
[2021.04 - 2026.68] fit and we got them into this world it
[2024.84 - 2029.04] is our responsibility to make sure that
[2026.68 - 2031.44] we give them the best environment
[2029.04 - 2033.00] possible what all we need to do is give
[2031.44 - 2034.44] them the environment everything else
[2033.00 - 2037.96] they will pick up and they will do what
[2034.44 - 2042.24] you do so very important for us to Walk
[2037.96 - 2046.20] The Talk lead by example we can ask them
[2042.24 - 2048.08] to play a sport or to go for a run in
[2046.20 - 2050.64] the morning I mean of course when they
[2048.08 - 2052.04] grow up a little bit we can ask them to
[2050.64 - 2054.20] do whatever we want to do but if we
[2052.04 - 2057.12] don't do that ourselves they will just
[2054.20 - 2058.88] not be interested in it so we have to be
[2057.12 - 2061.76] out there doing those things ourselves
[2058.88 - 2063.08] for example I would be very happy while
[2061.76 - 2064.96] angad has all the independence in the
[2063.08 - 2068.00] world to do whatever he wants but I
[2064.96 - 2070.68] would be happy if he pursues a sport for
[2068.00 - 2073.68] that what's important today today it's
[2070.68 - 2075.96] important that is Dad plays a sport so I
[2073.68 - 2078.08] play basketball once a week I go for
[2075.96 - 2080.24] swim a couple of times a week and I make
[2078.08 - 2082.72] sure that I compete at some level of
[2080.24 - 2084.08] course I'm not competing at a very high
[2082.72 - 2086.00] level right now but wherever there has
[2084.08 - 2088.84] to be some competition some sport in my
[2086.00 - 2090.80] life so angut can see that my dad's you
[2088.84 - 2093.72] know getting me a medal at home and he's
[2090.80 - 2095.64] so excited about it that's that's very
[2093.72 - 2097.32] inspirational because if your child you

[2210.72 - 2216.84] Fly weak like even I was very weak I was
[2213.80 - 2218.72] on the volleyball team so what should

[2218.72 - 2226.28] children in
[2219.76 - 2226.28] sports team team team manip in in team
[2231.52 - 2237.60] sports so what I'm trying to say is if I
[2235.28 - 2240.04] don't play a sport I mean I can ask
[2237.60 - 2241.72] angad as much as I can to go and play
[2240.04 - 2244.08] basketball and do go for a run and
[2241.72 - 2244.08] things like
[2244.72 - 2250.16] that now he has all the independ
[2247.52 - 2251.56] tendence to be whatever he wants to be
[2250.16 - 2254.88] at a later point he can choose his
[2251.56 - 2257.00] career but I will be happy if he pursues
[2254.88 - 2257.00] a
[2261.40 - 2266.20] sport that that
[2299.92 - 2307.72] purple
[2301.72 - 2309.88] Papa orange belt purple Bel competition
[2307.72 - 2312.04] actually as a father felt I have to do
[2309.88 - 2313.96] better exactly at some point they'll
[2312.04 - 2316.44] start giving us competition like you
[2313.96 - 2318.84] said but we have to be inspirational it
[2316.44 - 2318.84] starts
[2324.28 - 2329.88] here he eats from my plate right now do
[2327.16 - 2332.24] you smoke no I don't do you drink very
[2329.88 - 2335.88] rarely but not in front of your kit uh I
[2332.24 - 2339.16] mean I do it in front of him because um
[2335.88 - 2341.36] I think as long as I have a healthy
[2339.16 - 2344.28] relationship with alcohol I would let
[2341.36 - 2346.28] him see it the problem however gets to
[2344.28 - 2348.12] the point where the relationship with
[2346.28 - 2350.84] alcohol is bad my father was an
[2348.12 - 2354.12] alcoholic and everything that I saw with
[2350.84 - 2358.36] alcohol was like really bad it was just
[2354.12 - 2361.08] stress the if you ask my
[2358.36 - 2362.76] mother and which is why I feel I can't
[2361.08 - 2365.32] keep him away from things like that I
[2362.76 - 2367.16] can't keep him away from having to see
[2365.32 - 2371.36] people drinking alcohol or but you're
[2367.16 - 2374.12] also discipl disciplin yes I mean even
[2371.36 - 2377.80] if I drink I can't drink more than a
[2374.12 - 2382.00] pint I'm done you got you're done but
[2377.80 - 2384.48] but is this true gym trainers fitness
[2382.00 - 2384.48] trainers
[2388.68 - 2392.96] Fitness how to build the body and all
[2391.16 - 2394.88] that they know that the Nasha of alcohol
[2392.96 - 2398.48] is not helping them in their workout the
[2394.88 - 2400.00] next day or for the next 10 15 days so
[2398.48 - 2402.12] is this a common thing among all your
[2400.00 - 2403.96] trainers and all that you know alcohol
[2402.12 - 2407.64] consumption is kept to a low because it
[2403.96 - 2409.64] affects the body yeah our trainers are
[2407.64 - 2414.60] uh you know by Design very healthy and
[2409.64 - 2414.60] fit people um they also work very
[2414.96 - 2419.68] hard they on their toes they also have
[2417.76 - 2421.76] to be mentally sharp because we are very
[2419.68 - 2424.20] focused on customer experience as a
[2421.76 - 2425.96] brand they can't really I mean people
[2424.20 - 2428.28] can't really in that job people can't
[2425.96 - 2430.56] afford to be drinking alcohol
[2428.28 - 2434.64] regularly at least I mean I know there
[2430.56 - 2437.64] is I'm sure you will support this
[2434.64 - 2437.64] point
[2438.00 - 2441.72] Al true and then next morning you wake
[2440.44 - 2444.40] up
[2441.72 - 2446.80] dehydrated you don't feel fresh your
[2444.40 - 2449.56] workout is not that great so it's your
[2446.80 - 2451.64] entire next day is gone and if your day
[2449.56 - 2455.68] is gone as a trainer then that's just
[2451.64 - 2455.68] impacting so many other people
[2462.88 - 2468.68] passionate about
[2464.28 - 2471.60] Fitness what are the criterias that you
[2468.68 - 2473.56] as rishab look for when recruiting a
[2471.60 - 2475.88] trainer
[2473.56 - 2478.28] unes mean what are the qualification
[2475.88 - 2480.40] tick marks required for let's say
[2478.28 - 2483.20] anybody listening in to become a good
[2480.40 - 2486.24] trainer first thing I look for is uh
[2483.20 - 2489.24] purely passion
[2486.24 - 2489.24] for
[2492.36 - 2497.48] passion definitely that is definitely
[2495.04 - 2500.04] one checkpoint for me I need people to
[2497.48 - 2502.92] walk the talk uh but even before that
[2500.04 - 2505.92] are you somebody who would like to teach
[2502.92 - 2508.92] people are you somebody who gets excited
[2505.92 - 2512.56] not like that first Gym trainer exactly
[2508.92 - 2515.44] exactly that guy maybe he's really fit
[2512.56 - 2518.80] well built but he's not a teacher they
[2515.44 - 2518.80] need to be
[2519.60 - 2523.32] do I have the ability to teach yes
[2521.68 - 2526.68] exactly to be a guru to somebody people
[2523.32 - 2529.96] generally get confused between being
[2526.68 - 2532.68] enthusiastic about Fitness or being a
[2529.96 - 2534.72] customer of fitness and being a trainer
[2532.68 - 2536.80] both are different things you have to be
[2534.72 - 2539.08] enthusiastic about Fitness I agree to be
[2536.80 - 2540.88] a trainer but just because you are
[2539.08 - 2544.84] enthusiastic about Fitness Fitness does
[2540.88 - 2547.20] not make you a trainer to what
[2544.84 - 2548.96] temperament Fitness also is a hard thing
[2547.20 - 2550.44] for people when people come into the gym
[2548.96 - 2552.04] I mean we are asking them to move we are
[2550.44 - 2553.64] challenging their movement pattern we
[2552.04 - 2557.04] asking them to you know lift heavy
[2553.64 - 2559.88] weights Etc it just requires a lot of
[2557.04 - 2563.20] patience to you know teach people uh the
[2559.88 - 2566.24] right way of moving and patience exactly
[2563.20 - 2570.12] so teaching patience confidence
[2566.24 - 2571.12] confidence why confidence because uh I
[2570.12 - 2573.32] mean
[2571.12 - 2574.80] when you have to be you have to have a
[2573.32 - 2577.72] very strong point of view about things
[2574.80 - 2579.96] that you are telling people there is
[2577.72 - 2580.96] also so much information all over the
[2579.96 - 2582.84] Internet
[2580.96 - 2584.60] different and all of those things are
[2582.84 - 2586.20] there so as a trainer you need to make
[2584.60 - 2587.96] sure that you know your thing and you're
[2586.20 - 2589.56] able to communicate it really well in
[2587.96 - 2591.76] case of group classes if you are taking
[2589.56 - 2593.24] a class of 25 30 people and if you are
[2591.76 - 2594.64] not confident about what you're saying
[2593.24 - 2596.52] why should people even why will they
[2594.64 - 2598.00] even listen to you I think they will not
[2596.52 - 2600.00] follow you then they will not be able to
[2598.00 - 2603.68] follow you
[2600.00 - 2606.80] so interviews trainers so there was
[2603.68 - 2610.64] until many centers I used to interview
[2606.80 - 2613.84] each and every trainer coming into cult
[2610.64 - 2616.12] toti Kata harana all these different
[2613.84 - 2619.20] places to just find talent and interview
[2616.12 - 2622.20] them open
[2619.20 - 2622.20] field
[2622.48 - 2628.04] recruit dangal
[2626.04 - 2630.64] based so some great athletes and
[2628.04 - 2634.20] everybody would come wherever I saw that
[2630.64 - 2636.40] there is a guy who's struggling a little
[2634.20 - 2639.44] bit in explaining things to me just
[2636.40 - 2640.76] because they're hesitating it's not that
[2639.44 - 2643.04] they don't know the concept they're
[2640.76 - 2643.04] probably
[2645.72 - 2648.88] hesitating to
[2656.04 - 2662.72] that the only thing I wanted to see is
[2659.64 - 2665.60] he willing to put himself or
[2662.72 - 2669.04] herself outside their comfort zone or
[2665.60 - 2669.04] not g Squad
[2669.52 - 2673.56] I can teach you that you can always
[2670.84 - 2676.52] learn the subject matter but if we don't
[2673.56 - 2678.72] have the internal conviction then we
[2676.52 - 2681.20] useless I just wanted to see is this
[2678.72 - 2683.80] person really serious about this job
[2681.20 - 2686.76] because that required I mean they've
[2683.80 - 2688.88] never faced a crowd a kind of people
[2686.76 - 2691.88] that would you know come to places like
[2688.88 - 2695.16] cult they hesit they're hesitating in a
[2691.88 - 2696.92] one-on-one discussion and I know this
[2695.16 - 2698.68] guy will probably not do a great job you
[2696.92 - 2700.32] know you know from that corner he'll not
[2698.68 - 2702.68] be able to just he's just you know
[2700.32 - 2704.64] terribly challenged uh from from
[2702.68 - 2706.36] standpoint that maybe he could get
[2704.64 - 2709.60] embarrassed is what I'm trying to
[2706.36 - 2711.28] say but if the guy made the effort for
[2709.60 - 2713.12] me that's a win for me that's a
[2711.28 - 2714.84] checkpoint now let me go to the next
[2713.12 - 2716.96] stage I will teach him how to teach a
[2714.84 - 2719.96] squat no problem but this guy stick the
[2716.96 - 2722.00] box for me do you think trainers shelf
[2719.96 - 2724.48] life is also limited because it's based
[2722.00 - 2726.20] on looks also because you have to look
[2724.48 - 2728.28] good and so maybe by the time they're
[2726.20 - 2729.88] 354
[2728.28 - 2732.60] the career starts dwindling because this
[2729.88 - 2732.60] is what I have
[2747.28 - 2753.80] heard 354 is not it's not old it's
[2750.68 - 2757.12] actually very young U so that is an
[2753.80 - 2760.44] advantage of being in this profession
[2757.12 - 2761.72] uh both even from how you move even from
[2760.44 - 2763.40] the point of view of having aches and
[2761.72 - 2764.20] pains or how you look you will not be
[2763.40 - 2769.04] looking
[2764.20 - 2769.04] old benefit of doing Fitness but
[2770.52 - 2776.36] otherwi you can you probably charge more
[2773.20 - 2778.72] for for what you do you don't have to
[2776.36 - 2781.16] take that's very true because I remember
[2778.72 - 2785.36] once I hired a taii
[2781.16 - 2787.08] instructor and um he a young boy 22 23
[2785.36 - 2790.52] so he came in for the first workout and
[2787.08 - 2792.32] he asked me to do push-ups with my my
[2790.52 - 2796.32] elbows inverted without even doing a
[2792.32 - 2800.08] body assessment mhm and I was like
[2796.32 - 2801.68] P I'm 45 years of age and you're asking
[2800.08 - 2803.84] I I can do a normal push-up I can do a
[2801.68 - 2806.12] fist push-up but I can't do this push-up
[2803.84 - 2808.20] he nothing happens you can do it so I
[2806.12 - 2810.96] think what you're saying about the
[2808.20 - 2813.48] wisdom right so as you get older you
[2810.96 - 2815.52] have more experience you tend to
[2813.48 - 2817.68] understand people more and therefore
[2815.52 - 2822.04] you're able to guide better so sometimes
[2817.68 - 2824.68] a a more educated trainer may not be
[2822.04 - 2826.84] more smarter than a more experienced
[2824.68 - 2828.40] trainer and you need both you need both
[2826.84 - 2831.48] you need a balance of both yeah so even
[2828.40 - 2832.88] for like these 35 40 year old folks uh
[2831.48 - 2835.16] who've been into the fitness industry
[2832.88 - 2837.96] for a long time it is very important for
[2835.16 - 2839.32] them to keep upgrading their skill set
[2837.96 - 2842.20] there is I mean science is evolving
[2839.32 - 2844.44] every day you can't be talking things
[2842.20 - 2846.40] that were fresh 20 years back you can't
[2844.44 - 2848.84] be talking those things today to what
[2846.40 - 2848.84] upgrade
[2849.52 - 2856.80] and that's the reality of Fitness
[2851.64 - 2856.80] industry C I always say
[2867.36 - 2872.44] that so I think you don't you really
[2870.04 - 2874.72] start implementing science after one or
[2872.44 - 2878.40] two years of sincere training first you
[2874.72 - 2881.44] get the basics right but but speaking
[2878.40 - 2884.00] about wisdom and
[2881.44 - 2886.16] experience
[2884.00 - 2889.36] videy weight
[2886.16 - 2891.92] training weight training elderly
[2889.36 - 2891.92] especially
[2892.64 - 2898.84] ladies mmy really she lifs good weights
[2896.40 - 2901.28] how is it benefiting her why is Mr
[2898.84 - 2903.48] rishab making his mama do weight
[2901.28 - 2907.68] training what is the story behind it
[2903.48 - 2911.08] what is the science behind it so uh
[2907.68 - 2914.00] after the age of 30 all of us would
[2911.08 - 2915.48] typically start losing 3 to 8% of muscle
[2914.00 - 2919.72] mass per
[2915.48 - 2923.04] decade then women especially after they
[2919.72 - 2925.56] hit menopause they lose muscle mass and
[2923.04 - 2928.04] bone mass really quick we all will lose
[2925.56 - 2930.12] bone mass as as we age but women after
[2928.04 - 2932.72] menopause they will lose it really Qui
[2930.12 - 2935.00] quick uh and which makes it makes them
[2932.72 - 2937.08] more susceptible to getting fractures uh
[2935.00 - 2938.92] and falls
[2937.08 - 2941.48] so that's the problem the problem
[2938.92 - 2943.60] actually is that it's not not lift you
[2941.48 - 2946.20] know losing bone mass is not good for
[2943.60 - 2948.68] the quality of your life we know that
[2946.20 - 2952.12] lifting weights can really slow that
[2948.68 - 2954.60] process down and help prevent that uh
[2952.12 - 2958.16] loss of bone and loss of muscle direct
[2954.60 - 2961.16] implication on how you move how you
[2958.16 - 2963.20] feel uh you know get nobody likes to get
[2961.16 - 2964.92] fractures right so those kind of things
[2963.20 - 2967.04] and which is why I feel it's very
[2964.92 - 2969.08] important for pretty much every body to
[2967.04 - 2971.04] lift weights and even more important for
[2969.08 - 2972.96] women and if you think about it in the
[2971.04 - 2973.88] early days of human evolution it was
[2972.96 - 2976.92] women
[2973.88 - 2979.36] who us alive right all the lifting of of
[2976.92 - 2980.64] the food preparation exactly they would
[2979.36 - 2983.92] do all of that work which means they've
[2980.64 - 2986.08] been lifting weights since then not to
[2983.92 - 2989.44] mention there is child birth and the
[2986.08 - 2992.24] fact that women it's women who carry
[2989.44 - 2993.32] their children much more than men even
[2992.24 - 2996.20] you know children they want to be
[2993.32 - 2997.24] carried more by by the mothers so
[2996.20 - 2999.36] they've again
[2997.24 - 3002.12] lifting weights is very natural to them
[2999.36 - 3004.48] lifting and carrying weights is it's the
[3002.12 - 3007.92] most natural thing that a woman can do
[3004.48 - 3007.92] now there will be people who
[3012.08 - 3016.64] say and and then they would say things
[3014.36 - 3018.56] like it'll make you look manly it'll you
[3016.64 - 3020.28] know all those kind of stupid things
[3018.56 - 3021.84] because muscles and I'm saying stupid
[3020.28 - 3023.52] because muscles don't really have a
[3021.84 - 3025.72] gender right muscles are not reserved
[3023.52 - 3028.72] for any gender in fact muscles only have
[3025.72 - 3030.48] a functionality they exist to uh to make
[3028.72 - 3033.32] you move to make you work to keep you
[3030.48 - 3036.12] healthy and which is why I really very
[3033.32 - 3038.72] strong recommendation for all the women
[3036.12 - 3040.76] out there to prioritize weightlifting
[3038.72 - 3044.68] and they don't have to get intimidated
[3040.76 - 3047.08] by the big machines or the big guys at
[3044.68 - 3048.96] the gym like I said some of the big guys
[3047.08 - 3051.68] were really helpful for me so just walk
[3048.96 - 3055.08] in ask for help and start that Journey
[3051.68 - 3057.36] today so how often does a lady maybe
[3055.08 - 3060.16] plus 30 plus 40 plus 50 he need to work
[3057.36 - 3061.64] out per week at least three times a week
[3060.16 - 3063.88] I think uh three to they should be
[3061.64 - 3066.16] lifting weights three to five times um
[3063.88 - 3068.64] in a week uh that's what my mother does
[3066.16 - 3070.44] also she goes with me five times uh five
[3068.64 - 3072.80] times a week was she already working out
[3070.44 - 3075.48] before you started this cult fit Journey
[3072.80 - 3076.68] she was always uh a fit person conscious
[3075.48 - 3079.48] about
[3076.68 - 3083.44] Fitness um so
[3079.48 - 3086.12] she uh used to do aerobics and a lot of
[3083.44 - 3089.60] endurance training uh when she got she
[3086.12 - 3092.36] got married at an early age uh and um at
[3089.60 - 3094.36] my dad's house they had this well so
[3092.36 - 3097.36] what she used to do was just pull out
[3094.36 - 3100.00] water from that well about 40 buckets in
[3097.36 - 3101.92] a day that's that's like legitimate
[3100.00 - 3103.68] strength training right most people I
[3101.92 - 3105.44] know right now won't train like that she
[3103.68 - 3107.32] was also young and you know her body was
[3105.44 - 3108.96] supporting that kind of activity so
[3107.32 - 3110.36] she's been working out since then of
[3108.96 - 3113.40] course there was no trainer there was no
[3110.36 - 3115.44] gym then she got chance to work with an
[3113.40 - 3116.96] aerobics trainers so she worked a lot on
[3115.44 - 3120.84] her endurance because she was was very
[3116.96 - 3123.12] fit when my cousin needed a kidney she
[3120.84 - 3125.08] was able to uh you know donate one of
[3123.12 - 3127.92] her kidneys because so your mom does
[3125.08 - 3130.64] weight training after donating a kidney
[3127.92 - 3134.76] to one of your cousins it's been uh 12
[3130.64 - 3136.08] or 13 years since she donated one kidney
[3134.76 - 3138.92] and she's been
[3136.08 - 3140.12] lifting weights like in a gym like I
[3138.92 - 3141.72] said pulling water out of the well and
[3140.12 - 3143.96] all is also weight weight training she
[3141.72 - 3145.96] would have carried the three of us for
[3143.96 - 3147.32] uh me and you know my siblings for for a
[3145.96 - 3148.52] long time that it's also weight training
[3147.32 - 3150.92] but she's been lifting weights at the
[3148.52 - 3153.40] gym since cult started so since 2015
[3150.92 - 3157.36] she's been regularly lifting weights at
[3153.40 - 3159.40] the gym M So speaking of lifting weights
[3157.36 - 3161.36] and you're talking about moving how is
[3159.40 - 3163.88] how important besides your mother is it
[3161.36 - 3168.96] important for everybody in the family to
[3163.88 - 3171.52] move 100% because when you see people
[3168.96 - 3173.20] working out is I mean there is something
[3171.52 - 3176.00] about Fitness that spills
[3173.20 - 3178.56] over so the bottom line is that if you
[3176.00 - 3181.32] are a fit person if you're somebody who
[3178.56 - 3183.52] works out every day I can guarantee you
[3181.32 - 3184.60] will be more productive at work I can
[3183.52 - 3187.12] guarantee you'll have better
[3184.60 - 3188.36] relationships you will be you'll of
[3187.12 - 3189.96] course be healthier because that's what
[3188.36 - 3191.40] exercise does to you but you'll also be
[3189.96 - 3193.44] happier because you know you have no
[3191.40 - 3195.60] aches and pains and you're able to do
[3193.44 - 3199.00] your own work you are much better at the
[3195.60 - 3201.60] activities of daily living so there is a
[3199.00 - 3203.12] lot of happiness around you and what
[3201.60 - 3206.32] there's one more thing about you know
[3203.12 - 3209.68] doing Fitness or or doing things that
[3206.32 - 3211.88] are opposite is when you are with people
[3209.68 - 3213.28] who are doing that particular thing you
[3211.88 - 3215.28] are also more likely to do that
[3213.28 - 3218.12] particular thing so if you become
[3215.28 - 3219.60] somebody who works out people around you
[3218.12 - 3221.56] will be working out and then people
[3219.60 - 3224.28] around them will be working out and that
[3221.56 - 3226.36] just becomes a chain and as a nation we
[3224.28 - 3228.04] become much fitter much happier much
[3226.36 - 3229.40] productive much like going to the movies
[3228.04 - 3231.44] you know it becomes a culture hey let's
[3229.40 - 3232.84] go for a movie hey let's start moving
[3231.44 - 3234.92] you know hey let's go for a walk
[3232.84 - 3238.44] together hey let's go cycling together
[3234.92 - 3241.64] so exactly so wise points now speaking
[3238.44 - 3245.16] of people moving
[3241.64 - 3247.24] okay exercise variable P trackers
[3245.16 - 3249.64] pendrive so everything's getting Tech
[3247.24 - 3251.92] techsavvy and everything you know you're
[3249.64 - 3254.00] in that Cutting Edge world of expanding
[3251.92 - 3256.20] your gyms the exercise industry the
[3254.00 - 3258.92] fitness industry you have Rik Roshan on
[3256.20 - 3261.56] your team advising fitness programs and
[3258.92 - 3264.40] attracting people to workout as you
[3261.56 - 3266.04] explore are there any secrets in
[3264.40 - 3268.96] technology that are coming out or do you
[3266.04 - 3270.96] see any promising Trends as a guru in
[3268.96 - 3273.36] Fitness that you're like I think this is
[3270.96 - 3275.72] going to become something good for us to
[3273.36 - 3280.60] have as part of our gyms or as part of
[3275.72 - 3284.12] our exercise training regimes I think um
[3280.60 - 3286.52] as the awareness about Fitness continues
[3284.12 - 3290.68] to increase people have started to
[3286.52 - 3293.08] realize that uh working out at a pace
[3290.68 - 3296.04] which allows them to work out Nicely
[3293.08 - 3298.96] versus just going crazy in the workout
[3296.04 - 3301.28] is something that would keep them uh
[3298.96 - 3303.20] consistent in the workout for a long for
[3301.28 - 3304.20] a long run and people are also
[3303.20 - 3306.44] understanding the importance of
[3304.20 - 3309.84] consistency and compounding over over
[3306.44 - 3312.68] many years so I really see uh moderate
[3309.84 - 3314.52] intensity workouts uh from a weight
[3312.68 - 3316.08] training standpoint where people are
[3314.52 - 3318.04] working out taking some rest and then
[3316.08 - 3320.12] working out again but making sure that
[3318.04 - 3322.16] they are recovering enough between sets
[3320.12 - 3325.00] to get a great workout by the end of it
[3322.16 - 3328.60] so I see that happening I also see a lot
[3325.00 - 3331.80] of focus on joint health uh I talk to a
[3328.60 - 3333.04] lot of people because I I really want to
[3331.80 - 3334.92] be aware about you know what's the
[3333.04 - 3337.88] problem that I should be solving today
[3334.92 - 3340.44] versus 5 years down the line uh and I
[3337.88 - 3342.44] just keep talking to people and I've
[3340.44 - 3346.40] realized that
[3342.44 - 3349.00] uh uh most of them that I speak to have
[3346.40 - 3350.68] started talking about joint health have
[3349.00 - 3353.16] started talking about the fact that you
[3350.68 - 3356.36] know I want to be fit when I'm 60 years
[3353.16 - 3359.12] old I've seen my only yesterday some
[3356.36 - 3361.08] when a woman told me that uh I'm very
[3359.12 - 3363.44] inspired by my grandmother my
[3361.08 - 3366.32] grandmother at the age of 90 does all
[3363.44 - 3367.56] her work on her own I want to be like
[3366.32 - 3370.52] her I don't know if I'm going to live
[3367.56 - 3373.20] until 90 by the way but even if I live
[3370.52 - 3375.16] till whatever 60 65 70 I want to be like
[3373.20 - 3376.84] her and I know that lifting weights
[3375.16 - 3380.92] doing cardio is going to give me the
[3376.84 - 3383.24] energy to be like her so I I see people
[3380.92 - 3387.04] uh focusing a lot on longevity I see
[3383.24 - 3389.56] people focusing a lot on uh health span
[3387.04 - 3392.24] and those things look like the upcoming
[3389.56 - 3394.84] Trends to me uh from a technology
[3392.24 - 3397.16] standpoint of course there are these uh
[3394.84 - 3399.36] trackers which can track your sleep
[3397.16 - 3401.76] trackers which can track the quality of
[3399.36 - 3405.72] your workout uh and all those things
[3401.76 - 3407.44] while this it's not necessity I feel uh
[3405.72 - 3409.16] because eventually if you wake up and
[3407.44 - 3411.52] feel fresh you know that your sleep was
[3409.16 - 3413.68] great right if you if you feel like you
[3411.52 - 3415.52] know you can you know jump out of your
[3413.68 - 3416.84] bed get a great workout then you don't
[3415.52 - 3418.88] need a Tracker to
[3416.84 - 3422.64] uh to tell you that's so true actually
[3418.88 - 3425.00] you know I'm I mean um many of times if
[3422.64 - 3428.84] I know I get that 8 hours of sleep the
[3425.00 - 3431.08] whole of next day is just like so calm
[3428.84 - 3433.56] yeah and so happy yeah you feel like
[3431.08 - 3435.32] doing things right so yeah so feeling
[3433.56 - 3436.32] good in the morning getting up with or
[3435.32 - 3438.96] without
[3436.32 - 3441.92] technology many people will be watching
[3438.96 - 3441.92] this podcast and be
[3442.08 - 3449.08] saying should I do Fitness should I not
[3444.32 - 3451.60] do Fitness what is the maximum goal when
[3449.08 - 3453.88] people come to cult fit like
[3451.60 - 3457.24] statistically the beginners come in what
[3453.88 - 3460.40] is their predominant goal yeah to I've
[3457.24 - 3463.20] seen at a different point in time in
[3460.40 - 3464.76] life people have different goals now it
[3463.20 - 3467.80] could be like there could be a
[3464.76 - 3470.76] 40-year-old who wants to look absolutely
[3467.80 - 3473.24] shredded at an individual level or
[3470.76 - 3476.24] anecdotal references we will have you
[3473.24 - 3478.44] know all kind of scenarios but on an
[3476.24 - 3481.36] average what I have found after talking
[3478.44 - 3483.16] to people
[3481.36 - 3487.52] is
[3483.16 - 3493.68] Young like in you know 18 20 24 25 years
[3487.52 - 3493.68] old time majority of go to look
[3496.04 - 3502.72] betters I want to look a certain
[3499.28 - 3504.84] way body B and that's the reason I'm
[3502.72 - 3507.12] going to the gym and I want it
[3504.84 - 3509.40] fast time
[3507.12 - 3510.92] but as they keep maturing in that
[3509.40 - 3513.08] journey and it goes through a lot of ups
[3510.92 - 3513.08] and
[3516.28 - 3523.60] downs we've all had gone through that
[3520.28 - 3526.88] but as they mature in age the goals
[3523.60 - 3529.12] start to look like fine looking good is
[3526.88 - 3530.72] going to be a byproduct of lifting
[3529.12 - 3534.44] weights and doing cardio and eating
[3530.72 - 3537.28] healthy what I really care about is can
[3534.44 - 3539.24] I can I move well
[3537.28 - 3541.92] um I feel very stiff in the morning what
[3539.24 - 3543.44] I really care about is do I wake up
[3541.92 - 3546.00] without aches and pains and that's what
[3543.44 - 3547.52] people are telling uh people are and the
[3546.00 - 3549.68] example that I gave you right this woman
[3547.52 - 3551.80] who wants to be like a grandmother doing
[3549.68 - 3554.52] being very independent with her own work
[3551.80 - 3556.52] and everything else the logo goals from
[3554.52 - 3559.92] just looking good it changes to feeling
[3556.52 - 3562.40] better it changes to uh having no living
[3559.92 - 3568.04] a pain-free life it changes to being
[3562.40 - 3568.04] very healthy overall Jo health
[3570.12 - 3575.12] element the focus comes from just
[3572.52 - 3577.52] looking good more towards a wellness uh
[3575.12 - 3579.20] Spectrum so that is how I see the goals
[3577.52 - 3581.92] evolving but I'm pretty sure all of us
[3579.20 - 3583.88] go through you know that that Journey
[3581.92 - 3586.08] most of us go through that Journey yeah
[3583.88 - 3589.68] I remember when I was young I my first
[3586.08 - 3592.20] time I hit the gym was in 10 standard
[3589.68 - 3594.84] and I remember I went with one of my
[3592.20 - 3596.92] friends and uh the coach said the exact
[3594.84 - 3599.88] same thing that you got because I was a
[3596.92 - 3601.80] skinny kid right and and the coach says
[3599.88 - 3603.08] to my friend yeah you can do the weight
[3601.80 - 3605.80] training but you're not meant for weight
[3603.08 - 3607.52] training and that really hurt you know
[3605.80 - 3610.52] and uh I used to be on the college
[3607.52 - 3612.56] powerlifting team okay right and so as a
[3610.52 - 3614.40] skinny individual I could lift really
[3612.56 - 3617.12] heavy and we were the gold medal winning
[3614.40 - 3620.96] team uh and so the younger years was
[3617.12 - 3623.56] like muscle banan body banan protein
[3620.96 - 3626.08] powder whatever possible I tried and I
[3623.56 - 3627.48] realized that somehow maybe my the Apple
[3626.08 - 3630.76] you know doesn't fall far away from the
[3627.48 - 3634.24] tree the genetics the mommy Papa so they
[3630.76 - 3638.00] were skinny but now at the age of
[3634.24 - 3640.64] 48 U I keep telling my trainer I should
[3638.00 - 3642.12] be able to touch my toes uh you know I
[3640.64 - 3644.60] should be able to tie my
[3642.12 - 3646.48] shoelaces um you know bend down I should
[3644.60 - 3649.28] be able to do a squat and sit down in a
[3646.48 - 3651.36] squat for 2 and a half minutes you know
[3649.28 - 3653.76] I should be able to do my Surya
[3651.36 - 3656.64] namaskars um I should be able to lift my
[3653.76 - 3658.96] son who is 30 kgs correct right so small
[3656.64 - 3662.24] small things like that are more valuable
[3658.96 - 3665.32] today than body banan but you you
[3662.24 - 3670.00] pointed on a point which was how
[3665.32 - 3675.12] important that people want to burn fat
[3670.00 - 3677.00] and J what are rishab Tang's five tips
[3675.12 - 3679.52] over the years that you have learned for
[3677.00 - 3682.00] fat loss yeah I will uh I keep getting
[3679.52 - 3685.04] this question so pretty much top of mine
[3682.00 - 3686.28] I just sum it up First Nutrition is the
[3685.04 - 3689.32] most important thing when you want to
[3686.28 - 3692.52] lose fat first thing is eat less food
[3689.32 - 3692.52] and we live in a society
[3693.08 - 3700.36] where second eat sufficient amount of
[3696.68 - 3702.32] protein uh I again spoke to quite a few
[3700.36 - 3704.84] people and I told them I'd like to help
[3702.32 - 3707.44] you with your goals just tell me what
[3704.84 - 3709.16] your day looks like uh what do you eat
[3707.44 - 3712.20] through the day what what you know what
[3709.16 - 3713.68] are your goals while people felt that
[3712.20 - 3717.92] they're eating a lot of protein they
[3713.68 - 3720.64] didn't have protein uh in their diet so
[3717.92 - 3722.72] I feel that there is a change that we
[3720.64 - 3724.20] can make and I'm not saying go overboard
[3722.72 - 3727.12] but they should eat sufficient amount of
[3724.20 - 3729.88] protein third lift weights three to five
[3727.12 - 3732.64] times a week go to the gym and challenge
[3729.88 - 3735.40] yourself you got to work hard at the gym
[3732.64 - 3737.96] fourth sleep actually I'll bring sleep
[3735.40 - 3739.88] on the top sleep is everything sleep bad
[3737.96 - 3743.68] sleep is going to disrupt your eating
[3739.88 - 3746.44] Behavior bad sleep is going to disturb
[3743.68 - 3748.24] your workout quality to sleep
[3746.44 - 3751.04] and I've been through a very rough phase
[3748.24 - 3753.12] in my own life with respect to sleep but
[3751.04 - 3755.84] sleep then you have no business worrying
[3753.12 - 3758.36] about fat loss fix that first because
[3755.84 - 3762.52] otherwise nothing is happening and
[3758.36 - 3766.36] finally you got to uh make sure that
[3762.52 - 3768.96] you're getting off the couch so move a
[3766.36 - 3771.92] lot through the day when I was uh with
[3768.96 - 3774.72] you on my nutrition plan um I remember
[3771.92 - 3777.04] you told me to walk yeah because L
[3774.72 - 3778.96] whilst you looked very fit you had a
[3777.04 - 3781.16] little bit of a higher visceral fat and
[3778.96 - 3783.44] that could be your genetic correct you
[3781.16 - 3784.84] know as a marvadi you get that genetic
[3783.44 - 3786.72] programming into you where fat
[3784.84 - 3788.92] deposition is higher you don't see it
[3786.72 - 3791.36] because you're pretty flat but when the
[3788.92 - 3793.12] wing scale went internal and so we
[3791.36 - 3794.76] realize that walking was the only thing
[3793.12 - 3798.56] that would help you out no I and I was
[3794.76 - 3802.48] honestly you change a lot in my uh
[3798.56 - 3804.88] eating pattern I've learned so much just
[3802.48 - 3806.76] being on a plan with you I learned so
[3804.88 - 3810.16] much about myself like the kind of food
[3806.76 - 3812.20] that just does not agree uh with my gut
[3810.16 - 3814.32] the the kind of food that probably
[3812.20 - 3816.28] disturbs my sleep so a lot of learning
[3814.32 - 3818.92] happened in that process so while I came
[3816.28 - 3821.04] to you uh I'm going off topic but uh
[3818.92 - 3822.44] since we've got gotten it while I came
[3821.04 - 3824.40] to you with the goal of I don't know if
[3822.44 - 3826.52] you remember now but my goal was like do
[3824.40 - 3828.44] better at sports improve exercise
[3826.52 - 3831.00] performance build a lot of muscle mass
[3828.44 - 3833.20] shred body fat and those things happened
[3831.00 - 3835.92] and I if I remember it right I dropped 4
[3833.20 - 3837.76] to 5% body fat in the first month in the
[3835.92 - 3840.60] first four weeks of being on a plan with
[3837.76 - 3843.68] you all of that happened so when I came
[3840.60 - 3845.96] to you I used to get a little before
[3843.68 - 3849.76] that for a few years I used to keep
[3845.96 - 3851.36] getting uh a sore throat very often like
[3849.76 - 3854.20] pretty much twice a month or something
[3851.36 - 3858.92] like that and I went to doctors they
[3854.20 - 3860.80] gave me um uh anti- acidity pills and
[3858.92 - 3862.76] some other medication and someone told
[3860.80 - 3865.72] me that you may have guard we may have
[3862.76 - 3866.92] to operate it and things like that so in
[3865.72 - 3868.32] in my mind I thought maybe I'll have to
[3866.92 - 3869.92] get it operated maybe I have some
[3868.32 - 3871.60] something going on which I don't know
[3869.92 - 3873.96] about but when I came to you with a
[3871.60 - 3876.08] different goal you fix my food all of
[3873.96 - 3878.56] that goals I achieved but what I
[3876.08 - 3879.68] achieved was I like for one one and a
[3878.56 - 3882.08] half two years after that I didn't get a
[3879.68 - 3884.20] sore throat uh and I realized that it
[3882.08 - 3888.20] was probably because of the acidity that
[3884.20 - 3890.32] was happening and with good food it just
[3888.20 - 3893.56] you know took care of the acidity and
[3890.32 - 3896.52] throat was so the The Secret bill in all
[3893.56 - 3898.92] of that is just a simple concept
[3896.52 - 3900.72] whilst you can have a fitness diet with
[3898.92 - 3903.40] the right amount of carbs and protein
[3900.72 - 3907.48] and fat most people don't do a little
[3903.40 - 3909.68] bit of a deep dive into what fat what
[3907.48 - 3912.60] protein what carb correct and the
[3909.68 - 3914.16] quantity and the timing exactly so once
[3912.60 - 3915.60] you start getting this aligned which is
[3914.16 - 3917.68] what you did you came in and you paid
[3915.60 - 3919.40] for a six-month plan and then you
[3917.68 - 3921.40] started aligning it and then you started
[3919.40 - 3924.72] preparing it so you already had the
[3921.40 - 3927.16] knowledge but probably the execution and
[3924.72 - 3929.40] the small all filtrations of The Good
[3927.16 - 3932.04] the Bad and the Ugly did not happen and
[3929.40 - 3934.04] I think that's the basic part that most
[3932.04 - 3935.96] people in the fitness journey should
[3934.04 - 3938.44] subscribe to like you said no sleep is
[3935.96 - 3940.92] very important and one part to fix your
[3938.44 - 3943.56] sleep is not eating the wrong Foods um
[3940.92 - 3948.36] after 5:00 in the evening uh you can
[3943.56 - 3952.00] never uh outrun a bad diet and you can't
[3948.36 - 3954.88] um you know um out eat bad sleep exactly
[3952.00 - 3957.68] so these a lot of powerful things that
[3954.88 - 3961.00] you have done and it changed your health
[3957.68 - 3962.88] so I think uh you evolve to a level
[3961.00 - 3964.72] where you are
[3962.88 - 3967.28] now I'm
[3964.72 - 3969.64] athletic I'm pushing my body the highest
[3967.28 - 3972.36] level of training let's go back to the
[3969.64 - 3975.76] ABC of nutrition which I think most
[3972.36 - 3978.40] people are trying to wing it and
[3975.76 - 3982.04] sometimes they're listening to uh a huge
[3978.40 - 3983.56] plora of advices yeah that's a problem
[3982.04 - 3985.28] just taking nutrition advice off the
[3983.56 - 3987.08] internet is you know your mom and my mom
[3985.28 - 3989.72] are both nutritionist at the end of the
[3987.08 - 3991.76] day so you know everyone's a subject
[3989.72 - 3993.96] matter expert on that and So speaking
[3991.76 - 3996.16] about subject matter experts we'll come
[3993.96 - 3998.28] back to your profession which is Fitness
[3996.16 - 4000.76] what are the common mistakes that people
[3998.28 - 4002.16] make in Fitness when they start out I
[4000.76 - 4005.64] think the biggest mistake that people
[4002.16 - 4008.84] make is going too far too soon so people
[4005.64 - 4011.12] when they start fitness journey they
[4008.84 - 4012.36] would probably buy an annual membership
[4011.12 - 4016.20] and like I said they want to also
[4012.36 - 4016.20] achieve that goal fast
[4021.52 - 4023.72] and
[4027.40 - 4033.04] then they will be out of the fitness
[4030.44 - 4036.60] journey is over for most people so going
[4033.04 - 4040.00] too far too soon is a big problem second
[4036.60 - 4042.12] people just want to and it is maybe
[4040.00 - 4043.64] because they see things on Instagram and
[4042.12 - 4045.76] they see things on YouTube people
[4043.64 - 4048.20] deadlifting heavyweight the thing is
[4045.76 - 4051.60] that they just want to start loading
[4048.20 - 4053.52] heavyweight and going ahead of the curve
[4051.60 - 4055.96] while the reality is if the train slow
[4053.52 - 4057.48] one step at a time they will get to that
[4055.96 - 4059.84] weight they will get to that Fitness
[4057.48 - 4062.56] level but they want to do it in that in
[4059.84 - 4065.88] that week immediate
[4062.56 - 4068.20] imediate fast food fast body fast
[4065.88 - 4070.68] workout yeah exactly and then comparing
[4068.20 - 4072.72] yourself with with other people either
[4070.68 - 4074.84] at the gym or on social media that's a
[4072.72 - 4076.28] big problem even I have this problem and
[4074.84 - 4077.76] I've never been able to take it out of
[4076.28 - 4080.08] me it's like I always compare myself to
[4077.76 - 4082.64] a younger kid or a guy's got like beefy
[4080.08 - 4085.68] muscle like why can't I have his muscles
[4082.64 - 4087.76] why can't I lift like him so you're
[4085.68 - 4089.32] saying don't compare yourself to
[4087.76 - 4091.96] somebody else yeah I'm just saying just
[4089.32 - 4093.92] look at yourself have your how do I do
[4091.96 - 4096.92] that like do I keep like a card okay
[4093.92 - 4100.00] last month I deadlifted 40 kgs then next
[4096.92 - 4103.08] month I do 45 kgs so that is one way of
[4100.00 - 4104.56] doing it that you keep a workout log and
[4103.08 - 4105.96] you know that your overall workout
[4104.56 - 4107.92] volume is going up which means the
[4105.96 - 4109.84] amount of work that you've done has
[4107.92 - 4111.40] significantly increased over last month
[4109.84 - 4113.72] and it is going up month over month so
[4111.40 - 4115.24] you're doing great if you're doing that
[4113.72 - 4118.24] you will obviously build muscle so you
[4115.24 - 4120.28] can do your body composition check uh at
[4118.24 - 4122.08] a 4-we interval or 8 weeks interval
[4120.28 - 4124.16] whatever works for you but do that body
[4122.08 - 4126.92] composition check take your progress
[4124.16 - 4128.68] pictures because that is the truth if
[4126.92 - 4130.92] you see yourself in a mirror or on a
[4128.68 - 4132.64] camera and if you think yeah I've put on
[4130.92 - 4134.36] some muscle that's it it doesn't matter
[4132.64 - 4136.20] how other person looks like because it
[4134.36 - 4138.00] is you versus you you just have to make
[4136.20 - 4142.08] sure that you are getting better every
[4138.00 - 4145.44] day I love that statement you versus you
[4142.08 - 4148.12] brilliant so if somebody wanted to copy
[4145.44 - 4150.04] you you know you starting in the gym say
[4148.12 - 4151.64] a 14 year-old is listening in or 18 year
[4150.04 - 4153.24] old is listening in and they starting
[4151.64 - 4156.16] from zero and they want to become like
[4153.24 - 4158.04] you quickly what would they need to do
[4156.16 - 4163.24] just focus on the fundamentals what are
[4158.04 - 4165.20] they things like your Mobility stability
[4163.24 - 4169.24] like I there's one phrase that I really
[4165.20 - 4172.28] like love we do Mobility first because
[4169.24 - 4177.04] we didn't show up in the crib doing side
[4172.28 - 4178.56] planks ah you got my point yeah uh and
[4177.04 - 4180.40] as children Mobility comes very
[4178.56 - 4183.08] naturally to us right all those children
[4180.40 - 4184.40] they can uh put their uh toe in the
[4183.08 - 4186.76] mouth and all those things they can do
[4184.40 - 4188.36] right so Mobility is not a problem it's
[4186.76 - 4190.80] only over the years it becomes a problem
[4188.36 - 4193.28] for us so make sure that you restore
[4190.80 - 4195.84] that Mobility you make sure that you get
[4193.28 - 4198.44] that mind muscle Connection in place
[4195.84 - 4199.80] you teach your muscles how to fire and
[4198.44 - 4200.92] that happens through movement pattern
[4199.80 - 4202.12] training so there are basic movement
[4200.92 - 4203.88] patterns right you and I are sitting on
[4202.12 - 4205.92] this chair and we'll get get up from it
[4203.88 - 4208.00] what is that that's a squat we just need
[4205.92 - 4210.60] to make sure that we are able to do
[4208.00 - 4212.40] those movements properly with the right
[4210.60 - 4213.88] muscles firing at the right time and
[4212.40 - 4215.56] then eventually we are able to do that
[4213.88 - 4218.56] with load on it and that load will keep
[4215.56 - 4220.28] going up that's the process or uh like
[4218.56 - 4223.32] squat is one pattern hinge is another
[4220.28 - 4225.76] pattern Push Pull uh carry all those
[4223.32 - 4227.72] things you know we need to just teach
[4225.76 - 4229.96] our body how to do those movement
[4227.72 - 4232.40] patterns properly so my advice would be
[4229.96 - 4235.36] to just take it slow focus on the
[4232.40 - 4238.96] fundamentals and don't look at exercise
[4235.36 - 4240.92] as just exercise uh while you exercise
[4238.96 - 4242.84] also focus on eating well while you
[4240.92 - 4245.76] focus on exercise and eating well focus
[4242.84 - 4247.80] on following a good sleep hygiene also
[4245.76 - 4251.44] focus on recovery very important part
[4247.80 - 4255.12] what's your recovery uh routine I kind
[4251.44 - 4257.76] of spend uh a lot of time on my recovery
[4255.12 - 4260.36] uh um and especially after having a
[4257.76 - 4262.20] child I just change my workout and I do
[4260.36 - 4263.92] workout a lot you would have seen on my
[4262.20 - 4267.04] Instagram right I'm kind of working out
[4263.92 - 4269.96] all the time um and which means that I'm
[4267.04 - 4272.16] spending a equal amount of time doing
[4269.96 - 4275.00] things that are not there uh on my
[4272.16 - 4278.04] social media so uh when it comes to
[4275.00 - 4280.24] recovery the first thing is the best
[4278.04 - 4282.00] recovery tool is your sleep I mean no
[4280.24 - 4284.20] matter how much people tell you you know
[4282.00 - 4285.84] do that protocol do this protocol if
[4284.20 - 4287.60] you're not sleeping well nothing is
[4285.84 - 4289.72] going to work so you figured it out you
[4287.60 - 4292.00] figured that out and that's why by 8:00
[4289.72 - 4293.60] to 9:00 you're in that zone to get ready
[4292.00 - 4297.16] to sleep yeah I'm inan I'm in the zone
[4293.60 - 4299.40] at 7 like I would keep screens away and
[4297.16 - 4302.40] so so so rishab at her party is not much
[4299.40 - 4305.64] fun right after 8:00 you won't see me at
[4302.40 - 4307.68] parties I remember for New Year's uh my
[4305.64 - 4308.92] entire family was over and I'm
[4307.68 - 4310.44] constantly looking at the clock for it
[4308.92 - 4312.80] to come 12:00 and the moment it hit
[4310.44 - 4314.88] 12:00 at 12:15 I was telling my whole
[4312.80 - 4317.44] family okay come on everyone get out go
[4314.88 - 4318.96] home I need to go to sleep you know
[4317.44 - 4321.44] because we were awake by 7:00 in the
[4318.96 - 4323.12] morning so I get this thing that you you
[4321.44 - 4324.96] sleep is a good recovery sleep is number
[4323.12 - 4328.40] one anything else in recovery yeah of
[4324.96 - 4331.92] course so after sleep it is what you eat
[4328.40 - 4335.04] if you're eating a good well balanced
[4331.92 - 4337.20] diet that is going to help you uh uh
[4335.04 - 4339.64] recover faster for your future workout
[4337.20 - 4341.32] sessions and third easy and light
[4339.64 - 4343.60] movements like things like foam rolling
[4341.32 - 4346.92] soft tissue work doing some good amount
[4343.60 - 4350.08] of Mobility work uh doing deep stretches
[4346.92 - 4352.24] or just doing low intensity cycling all
[4350.08 - 4355.36] these things of doing a yoga class for
[4352.24 - 4358.04] example these things really help uh in
[4355.36 - 4361.04] recovering faster once all these things
[4358.04 - 4363.12] are in place consider doing an ice path
[4361.04 - 4364.68] and you know all those protocols that
[4363.12 - 4366.64] are generally spoken about they will
[4364.68 - 4368.16] help for sure but that's probably the
[4366.64 - 4369.64] top of the pyramid the bottom of the
[4368.16 - 4373.28] pyramid is you know these three things
[4369.64 - 4375.80] that I spoke about yeah you know you did
[4373.28 - 4380.16] say somewhere that you had sleep
[4375.80 - 4381.60] problems and now you've overcome them um
[4380.16 - 4383.92] what do you did what did you do
[4381.60 - 4386.88] specifically if you can remember to
[4383.92 - 4390.24] transition from that stressful part
[4386.88 - 4393.48] lesser sleep hectic lifestyle into a
[4390.24 - 4397.52] more healthier lifestyle a deeper sleep
[4393.48 - 4400.12] yeah so um I had a very rough phase uh
[4397.52 - 4404.40] with sleep for like I wouldn't sleep for
[4400.12 - 4406.44] weeks together and it was tough it was
[4404.40 - 4408.92] hard I also in that but I kept hammering
[4406.44 - 4410.72] myself at the gym so in that process I
[4408.92 - 4412.72] ended up hurting my spine so I liveed
[4410.72 - 4414.88] with a structural spine injury and I LIF
[4412.72 - 4417.76] with a structural spine injury uh that's
[4414.88 - 4420.48] a part of my life but I feel it happened
[4417.76 - 4421.60] because of bat sleep and lack of
[4420.48 - 4424.52] recovery
[4421.60 - 4429.16] therefore how I fixed my sleep is I just
[4424.52 - 4431.40] realized that it's behaviors first that
[4429.16 - 4433.40] you fix your behaviors and your sleep
[4431.40 - 4436.08] automatically starts to get better and
[4433.40 - 4437.52] sleep is not just the night time
[4436.08 - 4440.92] your preparation to sleep actually
[4437.52 - 4442.40] starts in the morning so I started
[4440.92 - 4445.24] getting in I started a habit of
[4442.40 - 4446.56] meditation at that time and I started
[4445.24 - 4448.84] with very it's very hard for me to
[4446.56 - 4450.32] meditate to sit that still for like 10
[4448.84 - 4452.84] minutes or 20 minutes but I pushed
[4450.32 - 4454.24] myself into it and I used to the first
[4452.84 - 4456.48] thing in the morning I used to meditate
[4454.24 - 4458.16] Under the Sun so that exposure to
[4456.48 - 4460.60] sunlight which I still do right now
[4458.16 - 4462.88] that's mandatory for me and my son we
[4460.60 - 4465.56] have to get that morning uh sun exposure
[4462.88 - 4468.16] and evening sun exposure also for him so
[4465.56 - 4469.88] I started meditating Under the Sun I
[4468.16 - 4472.36] think that played a really important
[4469.88 - 4475.84] role in just making sure that my day
[4472.36 - 4478.28] goes very nicely without much stress and
[4475.84 - 4481.52] everything I also second thing I did was
[4478.28 - 4483.84] an early dinner so I just uh uh finish
[4481.52 - 4485.92] my dinner off at uh I mean right now I'm
[4483.84 - 4488.88] doing at 6 6:30 but at that time early
[4485.92 - 4490.84] dinner was like 8:00 p.m. uh for me so I
[4488.88 - 4493.76] started doing dinner slightly early
[4490.84 - 4496.08] compared to 10:30 11 habit of feating
[4493.76 - 4500.72] very late at that time that really
[4496.08 - 4503.80] helped uh and just overall working out
[4500.72 - 4505.32] um in the first part of the day was
[4503.80 - 4508.36] something that worked well for me I also
[4505.32 - 4510.60] limited C caffeine intake significantly
[4508.36 - 4513.92] I love my coffee I drink a lot of coffee
[4510.60 - 4516.76] right now but after 12 there's a full
[4513.92 - 4519.44] stop after 12 no coffee I remember when
[4516.76 - 4520.96] we were working together uh two things
[4519.44 - 4523.60] that I knew that were going to affect
[4520.96 - 4526.96] your sleep was caffeine and the branchin
[4523.60 - 4530.48] amino acids yes and a lot of workout
[4526.96 - 4532.84] Executives uh will take a preworkout
[4530.48 - 4535.24] caffeine shot at 7:00 8:00 in the
[4532.84 - 4537.60] evening that you get a sleep but you get
[4535.24 - 4540.04] a very light sleep yeah so when you get
[4537.60 - 4542.00] up in the morning you don't feel fully
[4540.04 - 4545.88] rested because you didn't hit you didn't
[4542.00 - 4548.48] hit the Deep sine wave sleep and um I've
[4545.88 - 4551.20] had people who are even sensitive to uh
[4548.48 - 4553.20] BCA from whe protein and so the moment
[4551.20 - 4555.12] we give the BCA or the way protein in
[4553.20 - 4557.20] the morning or we changed the work out
[4555.12 - 4558.88] to the morning uh they just started
[4557.20 - 4561.64] getting deeper sleep so these These are
[4558.88 - 4563.56] small things that you know um will start
[4561.64 - 4566.24] popping out with people trying to do
[4563.56 - 4568.84] Fitness and in the Fitness World you
[4566.24 - 4571.00] know you um I see a lot of your
[4568.84 - 4573.80] Instagram videos and stuff like that
[4571.00 - 4575.68] what are your favorite uh movements uh
[4573.80 - 4577.08] in the world of Fitness if you had to
[4575.68 - 4578.64] choose like you know whenever people
[4577.08 - 4581.28] come for my counseling I say choose only
[4578.64 - 4583.44] five foods you can eat on the planet so
[4581.28 - 4585.92] rishab if you had to choose only five
[4583.44 - 4587.20] movements for fitness what would those
[4585.92 - 4590.20] movements be first is going to be
[4587.20 - 4593.32] weighted walks weighted walks yes I love
[4590.20 - 4595.36] weighted walks and that's again I think
[4593.32 - 4596.60] that should be the that can be the
[4595.36 - 4598.76] starting is it like carrying two
[4596.60 - 4600.92] shopping bags and walking putting the it
[4598.76 - 4603.52] could be that but it also just you put
[4600.92 - 4605.68] on a weighted vest mhm and walk that's
[4603.52 - 4607.84] it it's a great way of uh just getting
[4605.68 - 4609.88] strength training into your life without
[4607.84 - 4611.32] having to worry about you know form and
[4609.88 - 4613.36] technique and all so all the people who
[4611.32 - 4615.16] go walking in India and they just put a
[4613.36 - 4617.52] knapsack on their on their back go
[4615.16 - 4619.56] walking with that and say about 5 kg
[4617.52 - 4621.88] plate in that or 10 even lighter I mean
[4619.56 - 4623.96] they can start with just 2 kgs they
[4621.88 - 4625.52] don't have to go 5 and do their normal
[4623.96 - 4626.64] walk and just walk so that's weighted
[4625.52 - 4628.16] walk that's weighted walk that's your
[4626.64 - 4629.32] favorite number one that is my favorite
[4628.16 - 4630.48] number if there's one exercise I could
[4629.32 - 4632.76] do I would choose that because that
[4630.48 - 4634.24] helps you build muscle uh that is low
[4632.76 - 4636.68] impact so it's not going to hurt your
[4634.24 - 4639.44] joints as you get older and it is going
[4636.68 - 4640.52] to help you build bone mass y cult sales
[4639.44 - 4641.72] manager is not going to like this
[4640.52 - 4644.12] because everyone's going to go walking
[4641.72 - 4645.64] and nobody's going to turn up in C but
[4644.12 - 4648.16] what's your number two the thing is if
[4645.64 - 4650.00] more people are doing Fitness they'll
[4648.16 - 4651.28] still turn up in a fitness studio or
[4650.00 - 4653.24] better for any Fitness business in the
[4651.28 - 4654.92] world that's true because the same thing
[4653.24 - 4656.56] happened for nutrition the more people
[4654.92 - 4658.32] that started running and doing Fitness
[4656.56 - 4659.56] the more started taking care of their
[4658.32 - 4662.04] breakfast in the morning they turn it up
[4659.56 - 4667.32] for diet plans what's number two number
[4662.04 - 4670.40] two is uh get to the gym do squats do
[4667.32 - 4673.28] deadlifts uh do bench presses do
[4670.40 - 4676.44] pull-ups and do push-ups so these kind
[4673.28 - 4679.16] of things um I would really include in
[4676.44 - 4680.56] my in my training plan uh I mean this
[4679.16 - 4683.76] this list can be really long since you
[4680.56 - 4686.36] ask for five minuts so so so basically
[4683.76 - 4689.28] you're looking at you're just looking at
[4686.36 - 4690.44] people stimulating their muscle yeah and
[4689.28 - 4694.56] that's what you're looking for at the
[4690.44 - 4696.76] end of the day and I think for me as a
[4694.56 - 4699.16] nutritionist um the movements that
[4696.76 - 4701.32] you've just given me are predominately
[4699.16 - 4704.32] those wherein you say that muscle is the
[4701.32 - 4705.88] only age reversible organ yes and
[4704.32 - 4707.48] because you fast people to do this
[4705.88 - 4708.84] movement they're going to stimulate
[4707.48 - 4712.44] their muscle which is not going to grow
[4708.84 - 4714.40] older you know cool we had a nice
[4712.44 - 4716.52] session today but I can't let you go
[4714.40 - 4719.12] before I ask you some quick rapid fire
[4716.52 - 4721.88] questions what are the top Mobility
[4719.12 - 4726.60] exercises that one can do if they can't
[4721.88 - 4729.60] get to the gym okay uh Sur namashkar it
[4726.60 - 4731.52] just gets the entire body moving finish
[4729.60 - 4734.48] that off a few rounds and then don't
[4731.52 - 4736.84] just stop at Mobility get push-ups done
[4734.48 - 4740.08] get some glute Bridges done get body
[4736.84 - 4742.40] weight squats done and get some burpees
[4740.08 - 4745.28] done awesome what's your favorite
[4742.40 - 4750.40] postwork workout meal or meals I love my
[4745.28 - 4755.64] post-workout meals um so I do basic
[4750.40 - 4758.16] simple um oats uh cooked in water or
[4755.64 - 4761.44] milk um I'd have egg whites along with
[4758.16 - 4764.04] it and I love a v protein smoothie or a
[4761.44 - 4766.24] plant protein smoothie whatever uh the
[4764.04 - 4768.56] Smoothie would smoothie would be in with
[4766.24 - 4772.84] a banana some peanut butter and I love
[4768.56 - 4777.12] my peanut butter uh in either oats milk
[4772.84 - 4779.60] or water um with one or two dates
[4777.12 - 4782.36] awesome five habits that have helped you
[4779.60 - 4784.92] grow as an individual waking up early in
[4782.36 - 4787.80] the morning and working out first thing
[4784.92 - 4791.64] reading at least 10 pages a
[4787.80 - 4793.20] day uh the mandatory sun exposure that I
[4791.64 - 4795.24] do with my
[4793.20 - 4797.40] son spending
[4795.24 - 4800.28] at least doing at least one quality
[4797.40 - 4803.92] interaction uh with a family member or
[4800.28 - 4805.60] somebody I I love and following a timely
[4803.92 - 4807.80] sleep hygiene you know you've been
[4805.60 - 4810.00] training for many years are supplements
[4807.80 - 4812.52] crucial to getting that killer board
[4810.00 - 4813.80] you're having a great Fitness life I
[4812.52 - 4817.72] don't think so I think the most
[4813.80 - 4821.08] important thing would be the quantity of
[4817.72 - 4823.12] food and then if you have enough variety
[4821.08 - 4825.60] within your food as in you're eating
[4823.12 - 4827.60] enough sufficient vegetable
[4825.60 - 4829.96] you're eating sufficient protein you're
[4827.60 - 4833.20] also including some uh good
[4829.96 - 4835.24] carbohydrates Etc uh and after that when
[4833.20 - 4837.68] you've been into fitness for a long time
[4835.24 - 4840.32] is when having supplements will probably
[4837.68 - 4842.32] give you an edge three advices you would
[4840.32 - 4844.92] get into a time capsule and travel back
[4842.32 - 4847.64] in time and tell your younger self never
[4844.92 - 4850.60] let your sleep go off for a toss just
[4847.64 - 4854.08] make sure that sleep is topmost priority
[4850.60 - 4855.96] For You Second is hang out more with
[4854.08 - 4858.48] people who support your goals and are
[4855.96 - 4861.16] able to push you to be better every day
[4858.48 - 4863.64] and third is just travel a lot because
[4861.16 - 4865.12] I've learned a lot uh whenever I
[4863.64 - 4867.20] traveled how much ever I traveled I
[4865.12 - 4870.08] think it could have been a lot more than
[4867.20 - 4872.48] that so at culit you have Ric Roshan as
[4870.08 - 4874.56] a brand ambassador and you spent many
[4872.48 - 4876.84] many hours designing workout programs
[4874.56 - 4879.36] with him and he's one of the fittest
[4876.84 - 4883.16] Indian men that we have seen what is it
[4879.36 - 4885.76] like to see Rik rosan work with him and
[4883.16 - 4887.80] even work out with him yeah so I've I've
[4885.76 - 4890.16] never worked out with him I have worked
[4887.80 - 4894.36] with him with him on creating workout
[4890.16 - 4896.16] programs I would say he is humble he's
[4894.36 - 4899.68] intelligent he knows what he's talking
[4896.16 - 4902.88] about and he's deeply passionate about
[4899.68 - 4905.28] making Fitness accessible to this world
[4902.88 - 4907.04] before you go I know you have searched
[4905.28 - 4909.00] on that small bike through the lanes and
[4907.04 - 4911.40] I can always visualize you like like
[4909.00 - 4914.88] nice dark glasses searching for a place
[4911.40 - 4917.16] how did you find Ric ran
[4914.88 - 4919.96] okay so I've been a huge fan of Ric
[4917.16 - 4923.36] russan and uh so this is much before
[4919.96 - 4925.28] cult okay and after one of his uh
[4923.36 - 4928.04] Transformations I actually tweeted to
[4925.28 - 4932.12] him hey Ric what does your nutrition
[4928.04 - 4934.76] protocol look like and I had no idea
[4932.12 - 4936.60] that at some point I will be working
[4934.76 - 4939.00] with him very will get to work with him
[4936.60 - 4942.36] very closely I will get to create a
[4939.00 - 4944.32] workout program with him hrx workout
[4942.36 - 4946.84] that is one of the top favorites of
[4944.32 - 4949.28] people people at cult while I worked
[4946.84 - 4953.08] with him uh things that stood out for me
[4949.28 - 4955.72] one was he's very humble second he's
[4953.08 - 4959.48] very intelligent he knows what he's
[4955.72 - 4962.84] talking about and he's really passionate
[4959.48 - 4964.48] about creating an impact in the world of
[4962.84 - 4967.48] Fitness why so what I'm trying to say is
[4964.48 - 4971.84] that he could have uh delegated a lot of
[4967.48 - 4976.00] things um on the workout but he made
[4971.84 - 4978.08] sure that he spends time uh with me
[4976.00 - 4981.08] giving me the insights that he has
[4978.08 - 4983.28] learned over so many years working out
[4981.08 - 4986.16] and learning about his body and that was
[4983.28 - 4989.16] my experience with Rik rushan awesome so
