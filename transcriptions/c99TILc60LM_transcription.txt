[3.04 - 6.08] hi uh
[4.48 - 8.40] my name is ryan fernando and a sports
[6.08 - 9.76] nutritionist yesterday's french open
[8.40 - 14.00] semi-final
[9.76 - 16.00] rafael nadal in june 2022 uh had his
[14.00 - 19.04] opponent alexander retired her due to a
[16.00 - 20.80] broken ankle now many of you may ask how
[19.04 - 24.56] does you know you've not seen many
[20.80 - 26.64] people break the ankles live on court
[24.56 - 29.84] my take is a nutritionist and i've had a
[26.64 - 31.04] few athletes actually break their bones
[29.84 - 33.04] during
[31.04 - 34.88] tournaments practice etc i had robin
[33.04 - 37.68] singh famous footballer
[34.88 - 39.76] a massive guy break his anchor
[37.68 - 42.48] the underlining story is nutrition
[39.76 - 44.80] deficiency or nutrition excess hear me
[42.48 - 46.80] out on this okay because once i explain
[44.80 - 48.24] it it'll you'll get the logic as an
[46.80 - 49.60] athlete
[48.24 - 51.68] you see when you're an athlete you take
[49.60 - 55.04] a lot of protein so when you take a lot
[51.68 - 57.36] of protein protein tends to be acidic in
[55.04 - 60.48] nature so when you put it in your body
[57.36 - 63.20] it raises the the the acidity level of
[60.48 - 65.12] the human body so the ph drops now
[63.20 - 66.64] normally when we eat a lot of vegetables
[65.12 - 68.56] and fruits the body becomes more
[66.64 - 71.20] alkaline so when you take a lot of
[68.56 - 72.88] protein imagine the protein making the
[71.20 - 75.04] blood acidic
[72.88 - 76.80] so now when the blood is acidic the
[75.04 - 79.52] bones have calcium
[76.80 - 81.92] so the calcium says hey boss i can make
[79.52 - 84.40] the blood more alkaline if i dump some
[81.92 - 86.80] calcium into the blood so the calcium
[84.40 - 88.48] begins to leach out of the bones in
[86.80 - 90.48] acidic environment because of high
[88.48 - 92.88] protein diet at least take high protein
[90.48 - 94.16] because of high amounts of fitness but
[92.88 - 96.32] they don't balance it with fruits and
[94.16 - 98.40] vegetables second point there are
[96.32 - 101.52] genetic receptors for the absorption of
[98.40 - 104.80] calcium magnesium and vitamin d
[101.52 - 107.28] i predict that if we do a test for
[104.80 - 110.08] alexander in his calcium magnesium and
[107.28 - 111.68] vitamin d he will be chronically low
[110.08 - 113.92] this is what has happened for many
[111.68 - 117.36] athletes that i have tested who have had
[113.92 - 120.16] bone injuries poor broken bones so
[117.36 - 122.24] nutritional discipline by eating more
[120.16 - 124.72] protein but not taking enough of fruits
[122.24 - 128.24] and vegetables not checking your
[124.72 - 130.72] acid-base balance in your body and not
[128.24 - 133.92] checking your vitamin d levels could
[130.72 - 135.68] lead to career ending injuries could
[133.92 - 138.48] lead to catastrophic events like the
[135.68 - 141.36] recent french open so food for thought
[138.48 - 144.80] protein high bone leeches bone is
[141.36 - 148.00] brittle bone breaks under high athletic
[144.80 - 150.80] competitive pressure vitamin d causes
[148.00 - 152.72] bone formation to be better vitamin d
[150.80 - 155.20] lacking calcium lacking magnesium
[152.72 - 158.16] lacking can also cause for your bone to
[155.20 - 159.12] not have the raw material to be
[158.16 - 163.84] tagged
[159.12 - 163.84] thank you ryan fernando food for thought
