working parts in order so I'll see you on the other side hi everyone serious video if you're interested about your health I'm discussing um my annual Health Report uh this is not for people who are not serious about their health so if you're getting this video right now just disconnect but if you want to know more about how you can take care of your health my name is Ryan Fernando let's share my screen and so obviously the first thing that we want to do is uh your your first step towards sustained health so the Japanese live really long okay and because the Japanese live really long in their life uh you want to be understanding that they live to 100 100 plus so they do a lot of screening right so Japan and the Indian government went ahead and nura came to India and they're doing this amazing guest like facility but this healthy checkup puts healthy eating into perspective now being a nutrition coach I've always recommended people to do Health checkups I just turned 40 48 I'm I'm running on 48 right now I think I completed 47 or whatever I'm 751 you see the brain's not working that well right so you you need your brains and your sharpness to be there your muscle sharpness to be there your heart sharpness to be there your digestive system sharpness to be there so let me share my report with you and it's my personal report and I'm sharing it with the worldwide web not to gloat not to show off but would would you like to walk on a journey with me in taking care of your health that's the job of a nutrition coach and hopefully if I make these videos you will understand that hey this is something I could do now doctors and all say no you don't need to do it the traditional system of medicine was you break down and then you go to a doctor the current system is I want to be aware of what could be probable hurdles in my life because of my genetics because of my lifestyle so just want to come to you wherein they're giving me uh an input and screen which is giving a comprehensive look at common lifestyle diseases and Cancers so when I looked at the the protocol card I was really really U impressed that oh you're going to give me a report on all of this okay and what got my eye for this one was the heart calcium score now it is like saying it is the gold standard of trying to check for blocks in your heart and I've never done it in my life and I did it and uh I want to share my reports with you I guess you know the result result from my smile because I was really worried you know a few of my clients have had heart attacks um you know we have had some leading film stars and actors you know postco um we don't know whether the virus the covid virus the vaccination has an impact on the plaque formation heart and people are just falling down because maybe they're working out too hard and you know they get heart attack so are you a person who goes to the gym do you work out really hard what is it that you're doing so can I help you in terms of diagnosing that so so basically we did the whole we did the whole checkup over here and we got the lipid profile blood test done and and in 2022 if you're watching this many years later uh the test in Bangalore is 15,000 rupees in Mumbai and and I think Delhi is 18,000 rupees um so I thought it was great value for money because they gave me the dexas scan they gave me the bone bindle density they did the heart CT score and they did an analysis of a low density radiation CD of my entire organs so that was something to uh really you know write home about so let me go with the first let me go with the first one which is my U you know my uh body weight and uh I was very excited to know that my lean mass was 67% and my fat percentage was a little higher than I expected around 28.5% now my scale here in the clinic shows a a a nice 14% body fat but the dexas is a gold standard you know and what I learned from this was um the doctor talked to me about how the Japanese focus on the visceral fat which is the fat you know near the organs and so the fat near the organs so I'm kind of getting a little bit of a tummy over here so I can actually pinch it now at this age right so at at 47 I'm like I don't want this right but I'm working on but but this is subcutaneous of what I can pitch but what this is showing in over here if you go in and see over here is um you can see the visceral fat okay and what she said to me Dr latia said to me was the end doctor she said see Ryan you got a in almost everything which is amazing except for my blood pressure which was a b so I got to be more de-stressed and have less salt in my diet uh but over here the visceral fat in the Japanese they say you should be below 100 so she just start working on your core start doing stuff on that now if you don't have this knowledge the assumption is oh I feel fit I look fit I good yeah everything blue blue blah blah but the visal fat is going to contribute too much towards my cholesterol tomorrow towards my block and stuff like that so that's very very important for you to understand you know that you can you can uh do it from this perspective uh the other things that we looked at was bone mineral density so if you you know this green part over here is they check the bone density with the CT scan and you'll be surprised that women after the age of 50 this really uh sorry women after the age of 30 because of maybe earlier menopause this starts dropping so broken bones come earlier in women issues with uh osteoarthritis osteopenia bone mineral density all of these exist so if you know this the next question you ask is how can I change my diet how can I change my exercise so women above the age 30 men above the age of 50 you've got to do this and this is why I went for this test okay so this was a heart scan to check your calcium CT score and when I got the result the first question I asked Dr latia was hey there's no plock present and you have less than 5% chance of heart disease so probably somebody stresses at me out I might get a heart attack but fingers crossed I can now run on the treadmill I can work out a little bit more intense without always looking at my garment and say oh my heart rate's gone up to 17 22 right and you know you have the niggle when you get it off and everyone's making fun about VAT Koh touching his chest guys he's an elite athlete man he just rubbed his chest in like okay you know you do it at as a reflex you're doing a power breath over there he's taking deep breath so he can recover quickly massage his heart tell his heart hey buddy I'm there with you and stuff like that and the whole media blows up thinking his heart is wrong what he would or should do is get a calcium CD score what you should do is get a calcium CD score so uh please get this done uh it is expensive as a standalone I understand it's anywhere from 8 to 12,000 rupees if you go and do only this test and if you do the Whole Health checkup and you have a doctor joining all the dots together it's really really amazing my lungs were amazing they did a CT scan of my lungs that was all good and you know the calcium scoring was all good the lungs was good my ECG was good my eye test was good let me go back to the original report okay so how the report came back to me was was um no abnormality detected and if you get a d you going to have to take the screening report and go and meet a concerned doctor in that department so whether it's in the heart in the lungs the colon the intestine or the kidneys or its BP or its diabetes then they give you a d so what I liked about this report is they've got the years over here 2022 23 24 and I have not I have not met any of the good diagnostic Labs keeping your records and giving it back to you what nura is promising and please do get in touch with me because I'll get you the I'll get you the guest uh pass I'll get you the um the bumped up the VIP you know if I was a DJ you would call me up for tickets to the nightclub I'm the DJ to a health checkup so if you do get in touch with me U me or my team will share the link here down I think it's below down somewhere here or up there but we sh share the link with you so if you're in Bombay um Delhi or Goram you can do the need for what I liked about it is I got A's and everything right so I was like yeah yeah I'm super good and everything but uh this requires work I work on my diet I work on my exercise I work on my sleep I got eight hours of sleep last night um I haven't been working out my in the last week because I hurt my knee um and the idea of doing a heal checkup was to kind of push my body and sometimes some of us are delicate Darlings I I don't claim to be any Sports person I claim to be only a good brain nutritionist talented nutritionist from here so this is good the brain's good but the rest of my body is just like anybody out there it's not at an Olympic level but this gives me reassurance that I've got good health so I got to work on my blood pressure so what I'm going to do I'm going to work on my pomegranate pomegranate um you know helps elasticity collagen helps elasticity of the blood vessels so my blood vessels are more elastic you know as they as my BP goes up my vessels should expand so it's getting like hard pipelines the calcium CD score is correct so I got to figure out that M may be stress driven maybe are taking on too many cases running the nutrition business or trying to fill my plate with too much of stuff maybe I need to relax more maybe I need to do deep meditation I need to do breathing so this is a department that I'm going to work on so um I'm I'm super happy with whatever I found out I want to work on my blood pressure and this is how the report looks okay so in 202 23 there looked at all my things my hemoglobin blah blah blah blah and they're given me an a over here so um everything's really really nice nothing to complain about my hb1c which is a indication of my glucose I was genuinely surprised because I did do it at another lab about two weeks ago and was 5.4 so again I'm going to average it out between 5.1 and 5.4 and and next week I'm going to be putting on a glucose batch a CGM device for the second time when I did it last year in December I remember um what my levels were and what my so I'm going to do it again this year and I'm doing this because I think of my my body is a rul stri and I'm I'm kind of like okay what can I do to make it better and the one thing that I learned from this report is I need to put on at least another 4 kgs of muscle mass and that I'm going to do between this year and next year's test so I'm you're going to see me trying to work a little harder in the gym uh maybe dedicate a little bit more time to Fitness uh and and and get um an insurance policy written for myself which is muscle is the only age reversible organ in the human body and so uh from head to toe taking care of your body is your own responsibility remember you can um you know you can take care of um everybody around you you can change your phones you can change your mouse you can change you know you can change the AC in your room you can change your clothes I can change my specs frame you can change my car I can even change my spouse right you can't change the human body so I'm left with this guy in me what am I going to do about this guy so if you watched this video this far and I've kind of motivated you enlightened you given you some inputs I would be happy for you to come to Quan nutrition but after you get a b or a d or a c you get an A you don't need to come to con but by the way I just recruited one of the diti on my team onto my plan so I as Ryan Fernando work with the nutrition to make my diet plan because like it's like a heart doctor saying that he's got heart disease so he'll work on it himself now you go and work with another expert right so I'm going to work on my nutrition so if you want us to work with you on your nutrition get in touch with us at qua nutrition clinics we're a global clinic by the way if you do this test in your country anywhere in the world you just need to send me the report because the report gives us a crystal ball gazing into your future so we are literally like Health astrologers we can predict your future and and then what we do is we tell you to tie the string around your hand or you know when you get up in the morning uh turn your head in a certain direction and win at the sun no I'm just joking uh we can change the food that you eat so instead of putting on a ring that's going to give you an aura of energy let's figure out scientific stuff what you can put into your body how much of that you should put in your body and when you should put into your body like so how much when and what quantities and what timing of the day I think if you do all of this you'll get to the next level of um improving your health to the best possible level wherein you use food and your behavior as the absolute medication for the perfect God bless you my name is Ryan Fernando and if you like this video please share it with people around you uh who you are concerned about their health too better still watch it take care
