Title: Doctors Reveal the Major cause of DEATH

Description: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are health conditions that are not caused by infectious agents and cannot be transmitted from person to person. These diseases typically develop over time and are often influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Common examples of NCDs include cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes. NCDs are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems and economies. Prevention efforts, including promoting healthy lifestyles and access to quality healthcare, are crucial in reducing the burden of NCDs globally. watch the full podcast to learn how to control/prevent this - To get a proper balanced nutritional plan please fill out this form and my team will get in touch with you Other Socials - Link tree: Instagram: Time stamps: 0:00 – Rise of non-communicable diseases 1:00 – Ancient wisdom vs. modern illness 2:00 – Lifestyle changes driving diseases 3:00 – When to act on symptoms 5:00 – Fatty liver and carbohydrates 6:20 – Importance of ultrasounds for diagnosis 8:00 – Tailoring tests by age and risk

[0.36 - 4.48] we are getting a lot of these
[1.84 - 6.04] non-communicable diseases in the ancient
[4.48 - 9.04] time we had diseases that killed us
[6.04 - 11.60] because of typhoid or malaria but now
[9.04 - 14.48] we're getting rammed by stuff like
[11.60 - 18.92] diabetes and hypertension and heart
[14.48 - 20.96] attacks so is this on the rise and what
[18.92 - 24.48] do you think doctor went wrong since
[20.96 - 27.44] ancient wisdom and now modern
[24.48 - 30.16] sickness Ryan the non-communicable
[27.44 - 34.64] diseases which um typically cover
[30.16 - 36.40] diabetes hypertension cancers um obesity
[34.64 - 39.72] as well as now increasingly mental
[36.40 - 42.64] health are definitely on the Rise um if
[39.72 - 47.84] we take uh the Indian population back in
[42.64 - 49.80] 1990 so as recent as 1990 25% of the
[47.84 - 52.68] deaths in the country were due to the
[49.80 - 55.92] ncds or non-communicable diseases 25%
[52.68 - 57.32] that means 1/4 of our population was
[55.92 - 58.76] dying because they were slapping their
[57.32 - 60.56] own
[58.76 - 63.00] selves yeah
[60.56 - 64.48] yes kind of I I couldn't get it from my
[63.00 - 66.56] next door neighbor or my auntie or my
[64.48 - 68.08] uncle I brought it upon myself upon
[66.56 - 71.56] ourselves and at that time the
[68.08 - 74.20] infectious diseases uh were about 65% of
[71.56 - 76.92] the uh deaths in the
[74.20 - 80.08] country I think Medical Technology
[76.92 - 81.76] access to vaccines a lot of um awareness
[80.08 - 84.88] about some of the communicable diseases
[81.76 - 87.60] has resulted now in the these diseases
[84.88 - 89.48] going down and the non-communicable
[87.60 - 90.48] diseases on the other hand have been
[89.48 - 92.68] steady
[90.48 - 96.24] increasing in
[92.68 - 97.76] 2020 65% of the deaths in the country
[96.24 - 102.00] were due to
[97.76 - 104.28] ncds so we've gone from 25% to 65% in
[102.00 - 107.52] 1990 to
[104.28 - 110.64] 2020 so the ancient wisdom of
[107.52 - 113.60] Aura is now just a lovely name plate on
[110.64 - 116.20] our Board of India but internally we're
[113.60 - 119.08] getting sicker and we're not getting
[116.20 - 121.24] sicker because of infectious diseases
[119.08 - 123.48] it's it's these lifestyle diseases
[121.24 - 125.72] that's right I think um just to add on
[123.48 - 128.84] to what you said uh lifestyle changes
[125.72 - 132.84] that we've had in the last 20 OD years
[128.84 - 135.16] rapid urbanization pollution alcohol
[132.84 - 138.24] smoking uh processed
[135.16 - 141.84] food right and uh sedentary
[138.24 - 144.92] lifestyle um while you know we may be
[141.84 - 147.08] aware more about our health today but I
[144.92 - 149.12] don't think it's um in our Behavior it's
[147.08 - 151.44] actually something that we are abiding
[149.12 - 153.20] by so I think all those things are
[151.44 - 156.16] actually leading to a rapid increase in
[153.20 - 159.44] nties and seven out of 10 deaths today
[156.16 - 161.64] in in the world happen because of ncds
[159.44 - 163.40] so seven out of 10 deaths in the world
[161.64 - 166.20] happen because of non-communicable
[163.40 - 167.60] diseases which basically is you don't
[166.20 - 171.12] get it from something you kind of
[167.60 - 174.76] inflict it upon yourself so where do we
[171.12 - 176.72] act where do we act do we wait till we
[174.76 - 179.24] get that slap and in your case you're
[176.72 - 182.00] giving me statistics of death so does a
[179.24 - 184.76] person need to to wait till they die and
[182.00 - 186.32] then act or I know I'm joking about
[184.76 - 188.68] something about death but people need to
[186.32 - 191.60] wake up and get serious so where do I
[188.68 - 194.12] get serious do I get serious uh at the
[191.60 - 197.36] first sign of a symptom do do I get
[194.12 - 199.36] serious when i faint and fall down so as
[197.36 - 201.68] doctors uh you know practicing this
[199.36 - 203.84] Mantra of not Curative medicine but
[201.68 - 205.68] preventive medicine Where do we start
[203.84 - 208.64] how do we get people to get
[205.68 - 211.40] started if you see a symptom it's
[208.64 - 214.12] already in my mind a tad bit on the
[211.40 - 217.28] later side doctor if I can interrupt you
[214.12 - 220.76] for the lay man out there symptom what
[217.28 - 223.92] do we mean by symptom a symptom is
[220.76 - 226.24] something that you feel is off and that
[223.92 - 229.92] means it could be a pain somewhere a
[226.24 - 232.64] discomfort away from the normal way that
[229.92 - 236.24] something is functioned example you have
[232.64 - 238.52] a pain in the gut area or your digestive
[236.24 - 241.92] processes right and bowel movements are
[238.52 - 244.60] irregular you have pain in the chest
[241.92 - 247.76] area all of these are examples of
[244.60 - 251.88] symptoms something that you can feel
[247.76 - 256.20] visibly see sometimes touch this is what
[251.88 - 257.92] it is is a symptom and when we say you
[256.20 - 260.00] come in after a symptom at that point
[257.92 - 263.24] like I said it's a little bit on the
[260.00 - 267.08] later side our body is actually built to
[263.24 - 270.40] be very very resilient and therefore can
[267.08 - 272.04] compensate for a lot of the abuse
[270.40 - 274.08] is that why a lot of us have this god
[272.04 - 275.96] syndrome that we indestructible
[274.08 - 278.12] therefore we ignore the symptom exactly
[275.96 - 279.96] or symptom of the even the path towards
[278.12 - 281.44] that right you sort of start getting a
[279.96 - 283.52] little bit of a niggling feeling you
[281.44 - 285.96] know something is off the sleep is a
[283.52 - 288.72] little bit disturbed but you choose to
[285.96 - 291.56] procrastinate and push it out until it
[288.72 - 294.44] becomes something that's really tangible
[291.56 - 295.60] at that point it's a symptom let's take
[294.44 - 299.00] a
[295.60 - 301.64] example um one of the rising conditions
[299.00 - 304.72] um in India is fatty
[301.64 - 307.32] liver when we think about a liver
[304.72 - 309.56] transplant or liver curosis
[307.32 - 312.92] automatically most of us think about
[309.56 - 314.84] alcohol related liver curosis I drink a
[312.92 - 318.52] lot of alcohol and my liver goes off
[314.84 - 321.44] right our uh liver transplant surgeons
[318.52 - 325.52] say these days for every alcohol related
[321.44 - 329.16] liver transplant they do they do one for
[325.52 - 333.16] nonalcoholic fatty liver conditions ah
[329.16 - 334.68] so what you're trying to say is that
[333.16 - 337.40] just because somebody's smoking or
[334.68 - 339.40] drinking in the previous time we doctors
[337.40 - 341.12] said oh this guy is going to get
[339.40 - 342.88] alcoholic fatty liver disease now you're
[341.12 - 344.96] saying even without drinking they're
[342.88 - 348.20] getting it that's right even without
[344.96 - 349.96] drinking they're getting fatty liver
[348.20 - 352.48] conditions that's different from the
[349.96 - 355.84] alcohol related curosis let's unpack
[352.48 - 358.48] this a little bit more how a liver gets
[355.84 - 360.36] uh becomes a fatty liver is essentially
[358.48 - 363.88] due to excess carbohydrates
[360.36 - 367.08] Ates right because the first place of
[363.88 - 368.56] storage for excess carbohydrate when
[367.08 - 371.76] it's converted into something called
[368.56 - 376.44] glycogen is the liver it's only when the
[371.76 - 379.04] liver's capacity to hold that excess
[376.44 - 381.48] carbohydrates is surpassed does it
[379.04 - 384.88] actually go and settle in other places
[381.48 - 385.84] now when there's excess accumulation of
[384.88 - 388.16] these
[385.84 - 389.64] carbohydrates as glycogen in the liver
[388.16 - 391.44] there are structural changes to the
[389.64 - 394.88] liver and that can be only picked up in
[391.44 - 397.76] an ultrasound it will not show up in a
[394.88 - 400.84] blood test or the of the liver function
[397.76 - 402.84] test that's much much later when the
[400.84 - 405.40] liver has stopped compensating for this
[402.84 - 407.72] and says I give up I give up and that's
[405.40 - 410.04] when the liver function test starts to
[407.72 - 411.88] be abnormal but if you do an ultrasound
[410.04 - 414.48] you can actually pick up the structural
[411.88 - 417.48] changes much earlier doctor for the
[414.48 - 420.32] people that don't know what is this
[417.48 - 422.84] ultrasound yeah Ultra sound is actually
[420.32 - 426.16] an imaging technology that uses sound
[422.84 - 428.48] waves to help visualize what's going on
[426.16 - 432.32] inside your body but why would somebody
[428.48 - 434.24] do this so typically we have heard uh
[432.32 - 437.44] doing an ultrasound for pregnancy
[434.24 - 440.40] related yes right at looking the baby in
[437.44 - 442.32] the in the womb and so forth um but what
[440.40 - 445.28] we found is the ultrasound of the
[442.32 - 448.76] abdominal region actually picks up a
[445.28 - 451.72] number of abnormal uh conditions in in
[448.76 - 454.40] this area so stomach gallbladder liver
[451.72 - 456.68] pancreas ovary uterus right all of these
[454.40 - 458.84] get picked up in an ultrasound also you
[456.68 - 460.88] could do an ultrasound or kidney stones
[458.84 - 462.92] for kidney stones gallbladder stones
[460.88 - 464.84] also coted arteries sometimes you do an
[462.92 - 466.68] ultrasound to be able to see where where
[464.84 - 468.88] is the coted AR it's around here in the
[466.68 - 470.72] neck so the one in the neck that's right
[468.88 - 473.68] why would we screen an ultrasound for
[470.72 - 476.24] the neck cared artery this is for
[473.68 - 478.44] typically for stroke you know but
[476.24 - 480.24] youngsters will be like I'm not going to
[478.44 - 482.80] get a stroke but we hearing of so many
[480.24 - 486.28] people getting stroke nowadays so if I
[482.80 - 486.96] am in the 20s to 30s 30s to 40s or 40s
[486.28 - 491.60] to
[486.96 - 493.48] 50s are we doing this ultrasound or this
[491.60 - 497.04] uh you know the checking of my neck
[493.48 - 499.28] artery and all who tells me to do this
[497.04 - 503.72] yeah so also Ryan you don't do
[499.28 - 507.20] everything for everyone at all ages okay
[503.72 - 510.84] right different uh people have different
[507.20 - 514.04] risk factors different age Milestones
[510.84 - 516.92] you actually the in Risk increases so we
[514.04 - 518.76] actually can um think about a
[516.92 - 521.16] combination of tests that are most
[518.76 - 525.56] appropriate for each individual or group
[521.16 - 525.56] of individuals okay got it
