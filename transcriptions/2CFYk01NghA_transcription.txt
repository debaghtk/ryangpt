two decades ago arranged marriage is just what you're supposed to do and I was fully open to it but I didn't know it was going to get so hard there were moments where you know you just break down your family is breaking down with you should I actually go out looking for myself or should I just go with the flow my life changed only after marriage I became the best version of me because of my husband he helped me bring that out and I think without this support and everything I I wouldn't be doing what I am doing today you know finding that purpose phasing Fitness changing people's lives helping people get better when I finish maternity the my husband chose to become a full-time father he quit whatever he was doing the startup that he was a part of only so that I can go back to work and do what I deeply love doing
