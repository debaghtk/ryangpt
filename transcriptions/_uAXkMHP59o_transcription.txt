Transcript: [Music] hey good morning everyone actually good afternoon so my presentation today is to all the parents on Nutrition Fitness and doping I would like to give my thanks to the swimming Federation of India let's start off clearly I worked with a lot of superstars two Olympic medals very important for coaches uh to understand food can improve your performance anything that you do from a doping perspective my entire presentation today is to convince you to convince the parents to convince the children that in the sub Junior and the junior category you have to work on your nutrition your diet Basics I'm going to go very quickly I know many of you are hungry but I'm going to emphasize to you the importance of the Vada and the anti-doping laws that exist in sports I am part of the Indian Olympic committee's anti-doping Committee I'm one of the members I also happen to be the first nutritionist on India's doping committee now what I want to communicate to all the coaches and all the parents there is no magic pill the number one place for you to enhance your performance first is in your mind your brain second is your muscles third is your diet if your mind is strong your muscles are strong your diet is strong you can become a world champion I currently work with kennet bedner who's the fastest 200 m in athletics from America we work purely on diet and nutritional supplements which are legal parents all of you know that today there was a very famous Indian athlete banned for four years duti Chan has been banned for four years for for being caught with a positive dope test what is the function of v v is a world anti-doping agency parents coaches a very simple way a very simple way to get information is to go to Vada w.org and download the prohibited list if you want it easier just get in touch with me I'll guide you what is a function we're supposed to help in Code Compliance give you the prohibited list supp Force to be doing testing and investigations and doing research and development I want to explain to you today when you buy a medicine or when you buy a supplement how you can search for in the water list can I have the next slide yeah this one keep this slide please uh I've done this presentation in such a way that if you see The Orange Box every coach and every athlete can click this box and you will get the list to your phone and those of you who understand a PDF document suppose you buy a medicine and let's say the medicine contains paracetamol what you do you open up this PDF and you click search and type paracetamol if paracetamol does not come in the v list you know that okay this substance is not there again I need to stress to all of you the importance of protecting the athlete not getting a positive dope test relies on the athlete but these are sub Juniors and juniors so parents you are responsible parents you are responsible for what goes into your child's body coaches be careful on the supplements you recommend be careful on any medications that a doctor May prescrib it's important for you to know this because if your child is caught like Dy Chan today you get a fouryear band and forever your child is known as a cheater so this is very very important do you know recently people started doing plant protein uh some people are allergic to way protein way protein is milk protein so people started taking plant protein specifically hemp protein do you know if you take hem protein you will test positive because it has opioid like properties in it and opium like properties is there in the v list so I don't want to get into the technicality for parents simple for parents have a nutritionist have a sports medicine doctor if your child is swimming in a stadium like this and you're spending thousands of Rupees to come here to swim in a finals you should have the right with you which is your coach your trainer your nutritionist and possibly in your community a sports medicine doctor ask them what should I be taking what should I not take very interesting everybody I I was I was saying seeing some people shaking up a protein shake so I asked one of the swimmers uh which brands protein are you taking so he said XY Z who told you my friend is taking this very very important you want to understand that when you choose supplements you have to choose them with proper advice now only 8% 8% ask a dietician a sports dietician so please go in that direction but you know when these athletes test positive I'm always laughing I'm laughing because they say they give an excuse i c i was caught because it was found in a supplement let me tell you I have been doing this for 20 years I won two Olympic medals with shushil Kumar I have had more than 400 athletes and not a single dope test when athletes say they tested because of a supplement in my mind they could have been intentionally doping because if you say you have intentionally doped it's a life band so you blame the mother you blame the father you blame the country you blame the government you blame the supplement you even blame the swimming pool water for testing a do positive so it's very very important for you to understand your responsibility lies in knowing what you put into your body another thing can happen all the children who are here be careful be careful with your sports water bottle I know of an incident where a competing athlete CR a tablet and threw it in the sports drink bottle of the other person in training knowing that that person is the fastest swimmer and that person will test positive it was not swimming it was another sport so sabotage sabotage by coaches Sabotage by players Sabotage by anybody athlete you're responsible for what you put into your body if you're not sure don't take it so most importantly when I there is a site called inform Sports globally which test supplements now in India there are one or two companies that send their product for testing it will have a inform sports logo so if you look if you look at the bottom over there look for the logo products that have this logo are the better options for you to buy as a nutritional supplement because the manufacturer has given a guarantee that the batch has been tested and there are no ban substances in that what I do as a nutritionist I go to inform Sports website I type up inform Sports I say I want glutamine I want branchin amino acids I want uh sports drink I want magnesium I want a pre-workout I want a multivitamin if it informed Sports has a product it will list all the brands in the world then I call up a friend in America or Europe or Australia or look at which Indian company has that and then I order that supplement so that's one way you can be safer now the ways of intentional doping contaminated supplements contaminated food or drink I think the most important thing is lack of awareness I am recording this presentation and I'm hoping we can create more awareness I've been a nutritionist for the last 20 years I'm 48 years old India in swimming has not yet won a medal at the Olympics we need to win a medal at Olympics and it starts by learning to eat the food correctly not do intentional doping this is very important and I'm glad for all of you staying back somebody in this audience today I'm hoping the blessings of the Creator is there on you to win a gold medal but you have to do it with your brain and if you do it with hard work yes diet and supplements can be prescribed which are legally possible you can take coffee you can take BCA you can take a protein powder but sometimes that protein powder manufactured by a cheap company or contaminated with bodybuilding supplements could test positive so please get a professional working with you I remember when I was much younger there was a brand called U BSN and many Indian athletes tested positive because one importer decided to bring BSN products to India and so all the supplement dealers started telling the coaches product unfortunately for all the people who consumed ctha 6 which was a way protein powder and noo explode which they got amazing pump in the gym they all tested positive this was about 10 years ago after that we have been much more cautious in India but parents I'd advise you don't blindly prescribe supplements coaches please don't blindly prescribe supplements let's work together to get the right thing cough medication uh can you go back please yeah cough medication so if you see the bottom if doctor gives cough medication if doctor gives a hormonal tablet or doctor gives cold medication or fever medication or upset stomach medication take the name of the medication type it in V's list when you type it in V's list you will come to know if it's banned or not what I do for my athletes we share a list of which medication they can take another thing about this whole thing a lot of times you may take ayura and Homeopathy do you know a famous Indian gymnast tested positive for cold medication from Homeopathy so all you mothers who are thinking of giving your kids Homeopathy and nothing is going to happen your child will test positive because Homeopathy contains a drug called hamine and hamine is found inside for stimulating the lungs to open it up when coughs and colds but V says it's a stimulant and you will test positive and get a ban so please don't be very smart saying oh I can take ayura I can take uh homeopathy uh these are the athletes that were caught with intentional doping okay I I've taken out their names because I don't want to publicly shame them but they're there in public domain he claimed that his food or drinks were tampered with resulting in positive test who is at fault the athlete please be careful with your food and drink if somebody wants you to be B right now they will contaminate your sport strink your protein powder be careful I I advise all parents have a bag with a lock a biometric lock or a numbered lock he alleged that he had intentionally consume contaminated supplement I think before contaminated supplement to get to a certain level those of us who have been one two decades in the sport understand intentional doping and contaminated supplement in my opinion 99% of the cases are intentional doping if it is a contaminated supplement it's because you did not do the necessary due diligence it is your responsibility now you may turn around say but sir how will we come to know which supplement to take 961 participants in this entire Nationals I can tell you without a doubt only 140 people are on a nutrition plan but 900 people are taking supplements who's asked you to take supplements what about food what about Dal chavel Roti are you eating it correctly by the way if you take certain medicines like antibiotics or you know quatin tonic water it could give you a false positive meaning you've never taken anything bad but when they're doing the dope test that molecule of a good medicine sometimes looks like a doping product and gives a false test that's why they have sample a and Sample B sample a is the first urine sample by the way for all the Juniors and the sub Juniors coaches you will know this already when you go for doping they will take a urine sample the dop person will stand there and look at you pee into the Container you'll be like wanting some privacy no because people have cheated even with false urine samples so they will want to see you pee into the Container so this is part of the whole thing you you have rights and responsibilities as an athlete I can share that with you for those who reach out to us uh on the number that I've given okay so I come to the food part I want to convince you that you can enhance performance first place to win today the timings would have been 2 seconds faster for most people had they not eaten by a zato and swiggy you see the difference over here the source of food if it's homemade or online food delivery or restaurants most children are eating food from outside ingredients from a restaurant outsourced ingredients at home the most expensive and organic material prepackaged and processed at home is organic and fresh look at the last line Focus restaurants make food for profit the homemade food is made for enhancement of energy I can actually see this when athletes prepare their own food in fact Kenny who is the fastest 200 M athlete in the world they were ordering from out in Florida so he's like dude do you know something I started cooking my own food and I already feel that I recover faster so he asked me why is that I said that guy in the restaurant when he's cutting up the salad his boss is shouting at him and he's kicking him and doing everything and all how you think that salad is being prepared with a lot of misery and a lot of anger there is a salad Kenny is preparing at home he's like very happy cut yeah he's grumbling at his nutritionist because his nutritionist asked him to prepare the food at home but over a period of time he's realized he's buying fresher food organic food and it's helping him few foods that improve pomegranate and the reason uh the reason I won a few Olympic medals when you swim and you get lactic acid and you get domes delayed onset of muscle sess there is research that cument so a soy latte with Hali a black tea with Hali Hali is our cumin which is one of the best anti-inflammatories that you can take parents now that you heard it today don't give your kid one tablespoon you're going to kill them with acidity quarter teaspoon a day will help by the way there are studies on V2 Max being boosted lactate now food is not a magic pill oh Ryan Fernando said please take some ter th them you're taking turmeric you'll not get enhancement of performance it's 6 to 12 weeks for any food next slide chocolate chocolate yeah all the fathers mothers are going check it out chocolate chocolate not Cadbury chocolate not sugar chocolate but dark cocoa powder I'll repeat again dark cocoa powder boost it boost dark cocoa powder boosts V2 Max by 6% this was a scientific study done on cyclist so when I read that study I was like hey have a protein shake but put real cocoa powder parents all the chocolate flavored drinks it is nature identical chocolate it's not real chocolate if it is real chocolate that Dabba will cost 6,000 rupees so buy cocoa powder dark chocolate get your kid to like dark chocolate it's going to boost your V2 Max V2 Max is the oxygen carrying capacity blood lactate goes down by 8% with chocolate sir give me a supplement well 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder is going to lower your lactate why aren't we doing stuff like this why are parents going towards supplements all the time Dal chavel Roy beetroot beetroot is known to enhance baso dilation all of you swam just now I would be doing a beetroot juice now because it will dilate my blood vessels I'll do my Terra Gan and massage my legs out to take out the lactic acid there's no magic pill but your foundation for nutrition needs to be strong to get to the world championship levels otherwise we'll only remain in a stadium National level omega3 if if you are a non-vegetarian salmon mackerel and chovi sea fish which are high in omega-3 River fish unfortunately not very high in omega-3 however those of you are vegetarian you get vegan omega3 which is the alal omega-3 but chia seed flax seed chia seed flax seed and walnuts have an amazing amount of Omega-3 in it why not blend it and put it into your protein powder smoothie now for those who come up to me and say sir we come from poor families I I've constructed 100 g of protein within 50 rupees 100 g of protein within 50 rupees and this is the this is the equation oats 100 G Dalia 100 G gr FL 100 G soya chunks roasted gram and peanuts each one will give you approximately 13 g of protein the highest being soy so if you're a vegetarian and you have only 50 rupees even with food you can get your protein requirement so I'm wondering why everyone talks about protein supplements all the time yes you may need it post training but it's very important okay this is something I've created I call it R and noop swimmers don't have time to eat swimmers don't have time to eat so what is r and what is n so this is a creation i d because uh the players they could not they could not eat so uh let's say you're eating lunch now and you're very tired so I'm eating Chom Chom Chom Chom Chom after 5 minutes my brain says I'm not hungry I don't have any energy chew there's so much of lactic acid in the body even my jaw muscles are tired mama I don't want to eat Papa I don't want to eat I'm feeling very tired so mothers fathers R noop take noodles take uh Dal take rice put it in a blender and blend it and now you drink it you can get 500 to 800 calories within within 45 seconds sudden your brain is like so your stomach is going to go and say Hey you cheated me how can you put food so fast in it so learn to blend or make soups for these young kids because parents they burning the equivalent calories of father and mother together but your small child your small child cannot eat that much amount of food so learn to blend it next slide okay this one foods that decrease performance on one hand people want to enhance performance have you asked yourself have you asked yourself are there Foods I'm eating that are decreasing my performance so when you're eating outside Foods when you're eating processed foods I know the children over here don't drink but the older they become they do subject themselves to alcohol lots of chips a lot of chips packets lot of irated beverages lot of processed uh drinks these are empty calories if you can learn to eat correctly I promise you you'll go faster and stronger do you know that tonic water Lotus seeds poppy seeds and hem seeds if given in your diet can all test positive be careful so I'll take any question that are there later on I'll be outside in the gallery but my sincere request to the few parents here and my sincere request to the people watching this presentation number one you're responsible for what you put into your body irrespective of your age number two don't believe in quick fix methods to go faster you will get caught and when you get caught you'll be called a cheater for your entire life third point there is no magic food but as India's leading Sports nutritionist I can promise you this change your diet eat scientific eat home cook eat with calories planned eat with protein plan eat organic your performance easily will go up by 5 to 8% and 5 to 8% is what your coach wants the most important and final point I don't know if anyone has spoken to you about this but the mind and meditation is the most powerful healer of the human body at a young age children if you can learn to meditate and control your breathing I recommend a device called the aoit where you put in it like a snle and you breathe it improves your lung capacity I've had swimmers come into my clinic and I beat them at lung capacity so please learn how you can enhance your lung capacity that's it for my desk the the mobile numbers are up there I would like to thank uh the secetary of the swimming Federation the president uh coach nihar for recommending my name and to all the parents who've come all the way to baneshwar it's not difficult but at the same time it's very difficult to bring up a swimming kid so good luck to you and God bless you all
