are you someone who will crack a can without washing the lid off this is your favorite can y look at it you just take it buy it from the supermarket and you drink directly from it now this is an experiment where they're taking a swab and transferring it to a petri dish which contains agar AAR to see if bacteria virus fungus all of these things grow now first one no wiping second one with your shirt and third one with an alcohol swipe and now they're putting it in a specialized microbiological grow chamber and this plate is held for 2 to 3 days and we will see the growth of virus bacteria on that plate from that swap there are four options number one there was no cleaning of the can and look at the growth number two you clean it with your shirt like everybody else there is some growth and if you're OCD like me number three where you clean it with alcohol or washed it look at it no growth at all so the next time you see a can like this instead of your shirt wipe it down or wash it that's even better
