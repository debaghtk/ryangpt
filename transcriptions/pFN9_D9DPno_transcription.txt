[0.04 - 3.16] India latest research published by
[1.84 - 5.16] National Institute of nutrition says
[3.16 - 8.44] that our wheat and rice is getting
[5.16 - 10.32] weaker by 2024 year on year the mineral
[8.44 - 12.00] content in our Foods is dropping you
[10.32 - 14.00] want to be sure about it get a vitamin
[12.00 - 16.28] and mineral blood test done consult your
[14.00 - 18.44] medical dietitian to know what to eat
[16.28 - 20.32] and what not to eat better still add a
[18.44 - 22.16] few minutes in there because research is
[20.32 - 24.88] now showing that the calcium drop in
[22.16 - 26.96] rice is going to be 57% the wheat drop
[24.88 - 29.36] of calcium is going to do 22% and the
[26.96 - 31.64] iron protects us from anemia iron drop
[29.36 - 34.32] in rice is going to be a whopping 40%
[31.64 - 36.36] and in Weak 24% for me as a nutritionist
[34.32 - 38.20] I'm alarmed by these levels because this
[36.36 - 40.20] means whilst you assume you're eating
[38.20 - 42.60] natural and healthy it could be that the
[40.20 - 45.00] crops do not contain the requisite
[42.60 - 46.64] mineral nutritional power in it which is
[45.00 - 48.68] kind of a blindfold over your eyes
[46.64 - 50.72] remove this blindfold by subscribing
[48.68 - 52.60] organic food do a vitamin and mineral
[50.72 - 54.04] blood test do a genetic test start
[52.60 - 55.36] walking start breathing better start
[54.04 - 57.16] sleeping better and I'll see you on the
[55.36 - 58.56] other side as you and I get healthier
[57.16 - 61.08] because the food isn't getting us
[58.56 - 61.08] healthier
