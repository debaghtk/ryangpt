Title: Do we need to sleep?

Description: Quality sleep is an indispensable pillar of overall well-being, playing a vital role in physical health, cognitive function, and emotional stability. It is during deep sleep that the body engages in essential repair and maintenance activities, such as muscle growth, tissue repair, and immune system strengthening. Sleep is intricately linked to cognitive functions like memory consolidation, problem-solving, and creativity. Moreover, adequate sleep supports emotional resilience, helping individuals better cope with stress and regulating mood. In essence, sleep is not merely a luxury but a fundamental necessity that contributes significantly to a healthier, happier, and more productive life.

[0.16 - 6.68] so if you don't get enough deep and
[3.72 - 8.44] dream sleep you're not going to be able
[6.68 - 9.80] to be able to function effectively the
[8.44 - 11.76] next day and how effective is this
[9.80 - 15.16] there's studies that show this as well
[11.76 - 17.08] so Matthew Walker did this study with
[15.16 - 18.84] depriving people of sleep versus people
[17.08 - 21.16] who got 8 hours of sleep in a given
[18.84 - 23.80] night the next day their ability to
[21.16 - 26.20] retain new information dropped
[23.80 - 28.24] 40% so what's the difference hang on so
[26.20 - 32.64] let's let's summarize that if I don't
[28.24 - 36.88] sleep well my ability to learn the next
[32.64 - 39.48] day drops by 40% that's right so a lot
[36.88 - 41.28] of people who deprive so does this apply
[39.48 - 43.32] only to athletes or this applies to even
[41.28 - 46.96] corporate workers and even you and me
[43.32 - 48.72] every single person I read in your book
[46.96 - 50.76] and I highlighted this point and
[48.72 - 54.80] everyone should get your book if they're
[50.76 - 57.24] an athlete you wrote that for every 1.5
[54.80 - 61.48] hours of sleep reduction daytime
[57.24 - 64.68] alertness drops by 32%
[61.48 - 67.20] yes so should I sleep 6 hours should I
[64.68 - 70.92] sleep 8 hours should I sleep 10 hours I
[67.20 - 74.28] go by sleep cycles of 90 minutes each
[70.92 - 78.20] not by hours anymore please enlighten me
[74.28 - 80.96] on this yes absolutely so one sleep
[78.20 - 83.32] cycle which includes deep dream light
[80.96 - 86.92] sleep is around 90 minutes for the
[83.32 - 90.92] average person so 7 and 1/2 hours of
[86.92 - 95.12] sleep is five sleep cycles of 90 minutes
[90.92 - 96.36] each most adults need around 7 and 1/2
[95.12 - 99.04] hours of
[96.36 - 101.80] sleep if you're younger if you're a
[99.04 - 104.16] teenager you need closer to 9 or 10
[101.80 - 105.96] hours of sleep one second so are you
[104.16 - 108.76] saying the younger you are the most
[105.96 - 110.04] sleep you need yes look at baby my son
[108.76 - 111.52] is going to school he's going for
[110.04 - 114.00] tutions he to get up in the morning he
[111.52 - 115.68] just gets 7 hours of sleep yeah I used
[114.00 - 117.76] to do the same thing and I look back and
[115.68 - 120.00] say what was I doing I was in Stanis
[117.76 - 123.92] laws and bandra and running around with
[120.00 - 126.60] tutions and classes it will not only
[123.92 - 128.80] reduce your ability to learn new things
[126.60 - 131.88] when we see the brain scans in the Amen
[128.80 - 134.64] Clinics the areas of the frontal lobe
[131.88 - 136.84] the temporal lobe the back of the brain
[134.64 - 139.40] are affected with chronic sleep loss the
[136.84 - 142.32] same way our head injury patients are
[139.40 - 144.60] affected brain wise who W so are you
[142.32 - 146.72] saying that you know the kids that come
[144.60 - 149.40] to me who are between the ages of say 5
[146.72 - 151.52] and 15 for Sports Nutrition they should
[149.40 - 153.88] be sleeping more because if they don't
[151.52 - 155.52] sleep more their brain scans if he did
[153.88 - 159.04] one would show the same as traumatic
[155.52 - 160.64] head injury yes and why is therefore we
[159.04 - 163.24] should not compromise on sleep but
[160.64 - 166.76] compromise on tutions and play time and
[163.24 - 167.88] sleep more yes so 40% reduction in your
[166.76 - 169.68] memory
[167.88 - 171.84] consolidation it's like you're being
[169.68 - 173.80] sleep deprived your brain is a sponge
[171.84 - 177.16] that's already soaked it's not dry and
[173.80 - 180.56] have to take up new information now the
[177.16 - 182.36] old knowledge was that after you learn
[180.56 - 186.24] something you need to sleep to
[182.36 - 190.00] consolidate the memories yes 100% true
[186.24 - 195.04] but now we know for a fact that if your
[190.00 - 196.72] brain isn't adequately sleep fed you're
[195.04 - 200.52] not going to be able to learn anything
[196.72 - 200.52] new or even retain what you already
[208.68 - 211.68] learned
