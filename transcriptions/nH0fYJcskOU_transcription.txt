[0.04 - 4.36] fruit sugars were created by Evolution I
[2.88 - 6.92] think the sugars that are put into our
[4.36 - 9.80] Foods today are created by manufacturing
[6.92 - 12.32] man-made processes that is bad the sugar
[9.80 - 15.48] that is added to an irrated beverage to
[12.32 - 17.24] a fruit juice to all the package foods
[15.48 - 18.68] that we have that's the problem like for
[17.24 - 21.80] example I was on the flight yesterday
[18.68 - 25.16] and the so-called am which is mango
[21.80 - 27.48] juice had 6 tpoon of sugar in it right
[25.16 - 29.32] but if I make a mango juice it has its
[27.48 - 31.84] natural sugar I'm not putting another 6
[29.32 - 34.44] tspoons of sugar and that so the wrong
[31.84 - 36.76] is man-made package foods of fruit
[34.44 - 39.16] juices the right is homemade fruit
[36.76 - 40.52] juices or eating fruits the sugar and
[39.16 - 43.44] that is not good now we have this
[40.52 - 44.80] disconnect a lot if I eat one orange
[43.44 - 46.64] that's all I need but sometimes I want
[44.80 - 48.16] to have orange juice and Doctor whenever
[46.64 - 50.52] I squeeze orange juice I go through
[48.16 - 53.16] eight oranges to get one glass so now I
[50.52 - 55.20] have eight oranges of sugar minus the
[53.16 - 57.92] fiber going into my system so it depends
[55.20 - 57.92] who we are giving
