Transcript: India latest research published by National Institute of nutrition says that our wheat and rice is getting weaker by 2024 year on year the mineral content in our Foods is dropping you want to be sure about it get a vitamin and mineral blood test done consult your medical dietitian to know what to eat and what not to eat better still add a few minutes in there because research is now showing that the calcium drop in rice is going to be 57% the wheat drop of calcium is going to do 22% and the iron protects us from anemia iron drop in rice is going to be a whopping 40% and in Weak 24% for me as a nutritionist I'm alarmed by these levels because this means whilst you assume you're eating natural and healthy it could be that the crops do not contain the requisite mineral nutritional power in it which is kind of a blindfold over your eyes remove this blindfold by subscribing organic food do a vitamin and mineral blood test do a genetic test start walking start breathing better start sleeping better and I'll see you on the other side as you and I get healthier because the food isn't getting us healthier
