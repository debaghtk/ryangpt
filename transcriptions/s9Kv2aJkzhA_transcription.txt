so my first question to you what is acid reflux okay acid reflux is basically reflex of the stomach acid back into the esophagus reflux means what it comes back H regurgitation basically the acid should be in the stomach alone but unfortunately something has happened where the spinter muscle there is a muscle at the end of the junction of the foot pipe and the stomach it is supposed to close it's like a gate it's a gate it's a door if that doesn't close properly the acid comes so when you eat food goes inside the stomach the acid secreted by the stomach and it gets broken down into small pieces correct and then the lots of acid is being secreted because we eat a lot so what happens is if the door is open because acid is secreted acid comes back into the esophagus
