there is no super pill there is no Quick Fix You know that fat resides in your body for 8 years you know that if you overeat you're going to gain that fat you know that the food companies are tempting you you know that the e-commerce apps which are delivering food to your doorstep whether it's processed food or restaurant made food is delivering food in higher portions higher calorie higher palm oil higher bad energy in it because that cook didn't get paid that morning and prepared your food so you know this you just hiding behind the fact that you're not taking responsibility for your own health and therefore you're looking for a quick fix so when somebody presents you this idea that I can lose weight in 21 days or 75 hard people are romanticized with this idea that I can do it but whether the execution is possible or the side effects are there that's that's a whole another story so I always tell people slow and steady wins the race doing a diet plan has to be a lifelong idea it's not a diet it's a nutrition plan change the way you eat
