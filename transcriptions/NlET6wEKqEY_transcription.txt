[0.08 - 5.48] they always say don't judge a book by
[2.44 - 8.12] its cover the perfect example of the
[5.48 - 9.80] adage is sitting next to me this evening
[8.12 - 11.88] Mr Ryan
[9.80 - 13.76] Fernando what is the first thing that
[11.88 - 17.96] comes to your mind when you hear the
[13.76 - 19.84] names Amir Khan vat kohi PV synu and
[17.96 - 23.52] suin
[19.84 - 25.60] Kumar to me they the physical
[23.52 - 27.36] perfection even though Ryan may look
[25.60 - 29.96] like someone who has just passed out of
[27.36 - 32.12] school he has over two decades of EXP
[29.96 - 35.40] experience and expertise in food
[32.12 - 37.80] biotechnology and Integrative Nutrition
[35.40 - 39.60] and this expertise has helped him help
[37.80 - 42.56] these Superstars achieve physical
[39.60 - 45.28] Perfection through Ryan so without
[42.56 - 49.04] further Ado let's hear it from the man
[45.28 - 50.36] himself so Ryan thank you so much how to
[49.04 - 52.48] eat like a
[50.36 - 54.92] celebrity this is that is a curious
[52.48 - 58.48] choice of topic for this talk could you
[54.92 - 60.64] elaborate on why this topic was
[58.48 - 62.88] chosen so
[60.64 - 65.48] you know I believe everyone's a
[62.88 - 67.80] celebrity in their own Liv the
[65.48 - 70.28] celebrities get
[67.80 - 72.92] paid to follow a
[70.28 - 76.20] diet obviously because let's say you
[72.92 - 79.08] take a verat kohi if his body is not F
[76.20 - 81.28] he can't perform or you take say Shahed
[79.08 - 84.72] kapor or Manoj Baja who I recently
[81.28 - 88.16] worked with their body has to look good
[84.72 - 91.20] on candr so I call this the vanity part
[88.16 - 94.56] of being a celebrity
[91.20 - 97.68] but post pandemic everyone's
[94.56 - 99.08] realizing that you can have you can
[97.68 - 100.96] change your house you can change your
[99.08 - 103.56] car you can change your clothes you can
[100.96 - 105.32] change just about everything but you
[103.56 - 108.72] can't change the human
[105.32 - 111.20] body you are born with this human body
[108.72 - 114.20] you will go in this human water and
[111.20 - 117.36] unlike your car which you can upgrade or
[114.20 - 121.40] change the model you can't change
[117.36 - 124.88] this so by bringing a certain Celebrity
[121.40 - 126.68] Status to your body I always tell people
[124.88 - 129.56] and if you leave today's session with no
[126.68 - 131.32] takeaway there's just one takeaway that
[129.56 - 133.48] I'm very grateful for all of you coming
[131.32 - 135.32] in here for today's session or picking
[133.48 - 138.76] up my book or listening to my videos
[135.32 - 142.40] which is you are the most expensive real
[138.76 - 144.68] estate you never own true you are the
[142.40 - 144.68] most
[144.76 - 150.16] expensive so when you put Dal chavel Roy
[148.56 - 152.80] when you put food into you when you put
[150.16 - 156.40] anything into you you are the Amir Khan
[152.80 - 158.84] verat kohi Anushka Sharma awara Ray of
[156.40 - 160.68] your own human body and that's why I
[158.84 - 163.80] keep using this term celebrity
[160.68 - 166.00] nutritionist it sounds nice I am not the
[163.80 - 168.00] celebrity but I do the nutrition for
[166.00 - 170.72] even arm admy and today even the arm
[168.00 - 170.72] admy is a
[171.76 - 176.92] celebrity so now Ryan coming to your
[174.16 - 180.96] book bestselling book let me remind you
[176.92 - 183.92] we bless a guide to a gluten-free life
[180.96 - 186.04] how does it help the Common Man or is it
[183.92 - 189.04] just for celebrities and sports
[186.04 - 189.76] persons so this was the second book that
[189.04 - 194.00] I
[189.76 - 196.40] wrote and um to be very truful to the
[194.00 - 198.60] audience there's no time to write a book
[196.40 - 201.84] nowadays cuz everyone everyone's
[198.60 - 204.20] consuming video content but fortunately
[201.84 - 208.80] by the grace of the Universe I wrote the
[204.20 - 212.20] book and I chose weakless as a topic
[208.80 - 213.88] because I I feel a lot of people treat
[212.20 - 215.72] Dal Shel
[213.88 - 219.04] Roy
[215.72 - 221.08] as given to them out of love and kaisha
[219.04 - 223.40] S of for example who is taught you how
[221.08 - 224.84] to eat your mother your mother your
[223.40 - 226.48] mother's taught how does your mother
[224.84 - 228.44] teach you love and culture how did my
[226.48 - 231.40] mother teach me love and culture how did
[228.44 - 234.48] your mother teach you love and culture
[231.40 - 237.72] is there any science behind the W food
[234.48 - 241.20] culturally you know so my logic as a
[237.72 - 243.16] nutritionist now is
[241.20 - 245.80] you know when you send your car for
[243.16 - 248.24] serviceing the guy says sir are
[245.80 - 250.48] servicing now we take one us we connect
[248.24 - 252.28] a computer to a car and you come to
[250.48 - 255.64] another full
[252.28 - 259.24] Diagnostics but Dal R is still doing
[255.64 - 262.40] ancient way so writing the
[259.24 - 264.68] book was me having a decade of
[262.40 - 267.68] experience at the clinic where I
[264.68 - 269.88] practice and so in this audience I can
[267.68 - 272.44] actually take a bed if you spend 2
[269.88 - 274.92] minutes with me just on five questions
[272.44 - 277.40] I'll ask you my probability of telling
[274.92 - 279.88] you your gluten okay that is you can
[277.40 - 284.60] take it or gluten you can't take it is
[279.88 - 287.16] there the problem is when I tell
[284.60 - 290.76] you Glen come
[287.16 - 294.88] diagnosis but when you test it or you do
[290.76 - 294.88] a Diagnostics and you get the
[295.08 - 300.72] result I have to follow so weakless was
[298.16 - 302.88] kind of a blueprint to tell story and
[300.72 - 305.12] make people kind of go in that
[302.88 - 308.00] direction in hindsight I should have
[305.12 - 309.84] written a book which was about an office
[308.00 - 311.36] diet plan or a corporate diet plan when
[309.84 - 314.20] everyone goes to work how you plan a
[311.36 - 315.84] better then but I always listen to The
[314.20 - 318.00] Voice in the back of my head there's a
[315.84 - 320.20] voice that everyone has I'm sure all of
[318.00 - 321.68] you you know you get that ingry voice
[320.20 - 323.72] about where you should go who should
[321.68 - 325.88] meet or what should you do should I do
[323.72 - 328.16] it always listen to that voice inside of
[325.88 - 330.12] you a voice told me write a book on weat
[328.16 - 332.20] list it might help you people out there
[330.12 - 334.28] so I'm hoping if somebody needs it and
[332.20 - 337.56] even if one person changes their
[334.28 - 339.12] life I've done my job there is still
[337.56 - 341.80] time to write that other book that
[339.12 - 343.88] you're like thinking of you mentioned
[341.80 - 345.64] that the traditional way of eating I
[343.88 - 348.80] mean you've learned from your families
[345.64 - 353.16] your cultures so were they wrong in any
[348.80 - 356.08] way in U providing you the diet or the
[353.16 - 358.60] diet that each dge of
[356.08 - 360.24] follows we can never see our ancestors
[358.60 - 361.60] are wrong
[360.24 - 366.16] and
[361.60 - 370.04] what if I was Microsoft Windows version
[366.16 - 371.44] sery and today we have Windows 11 and
[370.04 - 374.08] the guy who R
[371.44 - 376.80] seven he was not wrong he took us to a
[374.08 - 378.36] certain place in society so our
[376.80 - 379.92] ancestors have brought us to a certain
[378.36 - 381.32] level and I just had this discussion
[379.92 - 385.20] with another fellow
[381.32 - 388.60] speaker which is society has advanced so
[385.20 - 390.32] much that maybe the crops that are grown
[388.60 - 393.20] on the soil
[390.32 - 395.96] is not having enough of minerals in the
[393.20 - 398.68] soil or maybe that the insecticides and
[395.96 - 400.56] pesticides are so high is different what
[398.68 - 405.64] my great-grandfather
[400.56 - 408.60] ate M that my grandfather ate no
[405.64 - 412.76] avocados and I can eat an avocado every
[408.60 - 417.24] day so my allergy reaction to no
[412.76 - 421.00] seasonality of food is affecting my body
[417.24 - 424.48] so therefore the way my ancestors eight
[421.00 - 427.00] was correct in their time and their
[424.48 - 430.80] day but we need to take bits and pieces
[427.00 - 432.92] of that fine unit so when we work in my
[430.80 - 435.00] clinic we actually don't go through a
[432.92 - 437.56] half an hour recall of what you do you
[435.00 - 440.00] can ask you what is your culture what is
[437.56 - 441.40] your background what do you normally eat
[440.00 - 443.44] and then when you give a nutrition plan
[441.40 - 445.40] to people they like but this is very
[443.44 - 448.00] close to what is already given but then
[445.40 - 450.16] we TW tweak it a little bit with science
[448.00 - 453.40] you ran one of your most quoted quotes
[450.16 - 456.12] is that muscle is the only reversible
[453.40 - 459.72] organ in the body what do you mean by
[456.12 - 462.20] that and how does it help with advancing
[459.72 - 464.76] AE I tell like I said at the beginning
[462.20 - 467.12] of the the whole session your mod is the
[464.76 - 470.88] most expensive real estate you'll ever
[467.12 - 473.92] own now whenever you buy a real estate
[470.88 - 476.44] you want it to appreciate in value
[473.92 - 478.72] unfortunately the human body which is
[476.44 - 481.60] actually your most expensive real estate
[478.72 - 485.28] is actually depreciating because of
[481.60 - 488.64] age but there was this research paper
[485.28 - 490.40] that was done so very interestingly
[488.64 - 492.92] let's say that this side of the never
[490.40 - 494.40] the research was done on two groups so
[492.92 - 499.00] that outside
[494.40 - 502.24] of or the 72y old in an old age home and
[499.00 - 505.64] they gave them Bingo Ludo Judo and all
[502.24 - 507.80] of those games the other side the 72
[505.64 - 511.36] year olds got a gym in the
[507.80 - 513.52] basement and for 6 months one group play
[511.36 - 515.36] and one group
[513.52 - 518.00] Grumble
[515.36 - 519.84] Bingo 72 years retired and know what do
[518.00 - 521.48] you want us to do here and this group
[519.84 - 524.04] grumbled about going to the gym and
[521.48 - 526.00] working out 6 months later they came
[524.04 - 527.60] back and did a biopsy for those of you
[526.00 - 529.52] who are not in medical biopsy means you
[527.60 - 533.00] take out a piece of your muscle all
[529.52 - 535.36] tissue so you biopsy of the quadricep
[533.00 - 538.28] muscle and they found out in the group
[535.36 - 541.12] that was Ludo Bingo Judo housi and all
[538.28 - 544.20] their muscle age Ed by 6
[541.12 - 546.80] years the group that had the gene or did
[544.20 - 550.16] the resistance training the muscle
[546.80 - 551.16] regress ringr meaning went back in time
[550.16 - 554.72] by six
[551.16 - 557.96] years so that study gave encouragement
[554.72 - 560.20] to scien is that if people take up
[557.96 - 563.24] resistance training or strength training
[560.20 - 566.68] at any point in their life irrespective
[563.24 - 570.64] of their age they can make the muscle
[566.68 - 573.24] grow younger so I I highly
[570.64 - 576.00] encouraged I am highly encouraged
[573.24 - 578.44] especially the women in the audience
[576.00 - 581.12] especially the women in the audience yes
[578.44 - 584.96] you running yes new your Zumba class yes
[581.12 - 587.28] new your dance class yes Yoda yes Pates
[584.96 - 589.68] but take up weight training because when
[587.28 - 593.16] you're 70 years of age and this is the
[589.68 - 595.00] 35th literature festival and you make me
[593.16 - 597.00] again you'll be like ly and check out my
[595.00 - 601.12] muscles and I'm still able to climb
[597.00 - 601.12] these stairs up so that's most important
[602.44 - 608.76] muscle anyone who is at any age who can
[605.52 - 611.52] afford testing we look at lipid profiles
[608.76 - 613.88] foros level lipin a lipin b sing
[611.52 - 616.48] reactive protein ESR now these levels
[613.88 - 618.52] are high and I've seen this athletes
[616.48 - 620.76] young athletes they're very high I tell
[618.52 - 622.76] the parents your kid is one
[620.76 - 625.80] designing what
[622.76 - 627.44] hyperactivity number one number two when
[625.80 - 629.60] people wear exercise variables and
[627.44 - 631.32] contract your heart haate most people go
[629.60 - 634.36] to the jail first of all they training
[631.32 - 636.60] and I am Superman and J's Bo so they
[634.36 - 639.64] push the body they may have an
[636.60 - 641.48] underlying isure so when you put when
[639.64 - 643.52] you start compounding these things it
[641.48 - 647.24] becomes a very H
[643.52 - 650.60] recipe and obviously if you look at the
[647.24 - 652.80] vaccination Posta Spike protein the
[650.60 - 655.00] spike protein which is produced by the
[652.80 - 658.20] technology in the vaccine to protect us
[655.00 - 661.04] against Co which is a good thing has the
[658.20 - 664.68] spike Prov attenuated Spike protein so
[661.04 - 667.68] that where the locations of action heart
[664.68 - 670.96] ovaries and women so when people
[667.68 - 673.84] agressively work out chances of light
[670.96 - 676.76] lot are also higher so now if you put
[673.84 - 679.36] many Cascades you look at the whole
[676.76 - 682.68] probability of let's say that one
[679.36 - 685.04] unfortunate or unlucky Soul had all of
[682.68 - 687.28] these permutations and combinations I
[685.04 - 689.56] for passim on and then they come to the
[687.28 - 693.36] protein Park which
[689.56 - 696.24] I genuinely Caron the industry is
[693.36 - 698.36] promoting too much of protein today so
[696.24 - 700.04] you have too many of the supplement
[698.36 - 701.84] manufacturers saying you need to take a
[700.04 - 703.52] protein supplement like I go in the gym
[701.84 - 705.08] that I don't take a protein supplement
[703.52 - 706.88] cuz I work for supplement companies
[705.08 - 708.40] before I started my own nutrition gaming
[706.88 - 709.84] and I got threee protein supplements and
[708.40 - 713.08] no matter how much of protein supplement
[709.84 - 714.72] I took I did not become Manus was Neer
[713.08 - 717.24] so the thought process over here is the
[714.72 - 719.40] Showmanship so today in the gyming
[717.24 - 722.92] industry the youngsters are are going
[719.40 - 726.48] after what we call a show Muscle instead
[722.92 - 728.28] I ask them to go after go muscle so you
[726.48 - 730.56] need to have go muscle rather than Show
[728.28 - 733.36] Muscle so in the art of chasing show
[730.56 - 736.68] Muscle they now dunk more protein minus
[733.36 - 740.12] carbs minus fiber causes gut problems
[736.68 - 742.72] causes various issues which maybe the
[740.12 - 745.52] body shouldn't be getting 200 g of
[742.72 - 747.88] protein a day so when you put all of
[745.52 - 749.40] these things together I think
[747.88 - 752.44] it's
[749.40 - 755.96] it's end Gym trainer giving
[752.44 - 759.88] advice to an influential person and and
[755.96 - 762.52] I've seen this even recently in my gym
[759.88 - 765.64] there was a highly qualified medical
[762.52 - 768.72] person who was taking advice from the
[765.64 - 771.24] Gym trainer and IA the person as old and
[768.72 - 773.68] I said listen you are so highly
[771.24 - 776.08] educated but just because Danka is a
[773.68 - 778.92] great body listening to the advice so
[776.08 - 781.12] sometimes he the way people look today
[778.92 - 783.64] and all this capture people are easily
[781.12 - 786.52] swayed to start changing their diet to
[783.64 - 788.28] these exotic diets they try to fire
[786.52 - 790.44] follow those diets and get this show
[788.28 - 792.12] body and somewhere along the line if
[790.44 - 794.44] they've not found this underlining
[792.12 - 796.40] condition then it's a recipe for
[794.44 - 798.16] disaster for them and how do you go
[796.40 - 800.76] about deciding on what foods are
[798.16 - 802.64] beneficial for someone and what not I
[800.76 - 805.20] mean are there some tests you perform
[802.64 - 806.72] some parameters you judge how does the
[805.20 - 809.32] whole thing work when someone approaches
[806.72 - 811.24] you for the first time so you see
[809.32 - 813.28] um as I said earlier I was working with
[811.24 - 816.24] supplement companies and we were selling
[813.28 - 818.32] these multivitamins hble drug and
[816.24 - 822.56] protein MERS and all and then every time
[818.32 - 822.56] we told somebody to take a PR they said
[822.72 - 827.68] by now if you understand the world of
[825.64 - 830.76] nutrition there are Specialists called
[827.68 - 833.56] dietition or nutritionist the difference
[830.76 - 836.00] is a dietician can work in a hospital or
[833.56 - 839.48] nutritionist Works in general lifestyle
[836.00 - 842.52] conditions when such individual
[839.48 - 845.24] prescribe a diet what do the go with in
[842.52 - 848.24] the fast it was Sir what do you like to
[845.24 - 851.40] eat or you like to eatly a k toly so
[848.24 - 853.76] they need portion control and I in a two
[851.40 - 856.24] netive practice we started off at a wing
[853.76 - 858.00] scale so we looked at your BMI then
[856.24 - 860.64] broughten down lower then you got this
[858.00 - 862.92] Advanced wi scale this Advanced wi scale
[860.64 - 866.32] has F percentage and visle F so was able
[862.92 - 867.96] to shock people visal fat is Shifting
[866.32 - 870.36] and your body age sir what is your
[867.96 - 872.88] clinical age oh my my birth centy age is
[870.36 - 874.76] 40 but were Vis Fant age is showing now
[872.88 - 876.40] you're 65 so we would sh people and then
[874.76 - 877.44] get them to follow the diet then we went
[876.40 - 879.76] into blood
[877.44 - 882.36] testing then we went into genetic
[879.76 - 884.08] testing so the genetic testing Where You
[882.36 - 886.48] observe the foods is called
[884.08 - 889.48] nutrigenomics so for example I have a
[886.48 - 891.92] caffeine sensitivity Gene my dad's a
[889.48 - 895.08] South indiia he loves coffee I love
[891.92 - 897.68] coffee but when I did the genetic test
[895.08 - 900.32] it was like you are a slow responder to
[897.68 - 903.16] caffeine and if I drink more than four
[900.32 - 905.76] to five cups of coffee because I'm a
[903.16 - 909.64] slow responder to caffeine my risk of
[905.76 - 912.64] heart attack is higher however sort of
[909.64 - 914.88] if let's say you have a fast processing
[912.64 - 919.44] caffeine Gene you should drink six cups
[914.88 - 922.08] of coffee a day so nutrition is becoming
[919.44 - 925.36] diagnostically treatable from what you
[922.08 - 927.72] should be taking and at the same time
[925.36 - 929.84] the latest now is the microbiome which
[927.72 - 932.28] is the poop analys of the stool analysis
[929.84 - 934.76] and the huge data coming out of that so
[932.28 - 936.40] much so that rheumatoid arthritis in one
[934.76 - 939.20] of the latest articles that I'm been
[936.40 - 941.88] reading is not being caused by a nonv
[939.20 - 945.16] it's being caused by a bacteria in your
[941.88 - 947.72] gut that has the ability to pump up the
[945.16 - 951.32] rheumatoid factor in your
[947.72 - 952.84] body and Par in the last 2 years you may
[951.32 - 956.08] have seen a lot of companies for those
[952.84 - 959.28] of you who are diabetic the cgn devices
[956.08 - 961.08] come out continuous glucose monitor
[959.28 - 962.76] we've always had that pin prick and keep
[961.08 - 966.84] testing our glucose levels been around
[962.76 - 971.44] for about 15 20 years now but the singam
[966.84 - 974.56] one is giving people real time data oh I
[971.44 - 976.12] had Biryani in nakur for lunch and my
[974.56 - 978.60] sugar went up to
[976.12 - 981.12] 210 so suddenly what happens is there's
[978.60 - 983.28] an awareness coming out so as a
[981.12 - 985.40] nutritionist when I take all of these
[983.28 - 986.28] factors and marriage into technology
[985.40 - 989.20] which is a
[986.28 - 993.04] software I now get a nutrition plan
[989.20 - 996.68] which is bioindividual and very accurate
[993.04 - 1000.12] unforunately to do this seismic activity
[996.68 - 1003.56] is quite expensive and time consuming
[1000.12 - 1005.56] but the good news is the costs are
[1003.56 - 1008.88] dropping every
[1005.56 - 1012.16] year and with the Advent of artificial
[1008.88 - 1015.16] intelligence I Believe by
[1012.16 - 1016.88] 2030 Ryan Fernando will retire and there
[1015.16 - 1019.72] will be an alar
[1016.88 - 1021.72] of ran fando telling you you should be
[1019.72 - 1023.68] eating this and you should be doing that
[1021.72 - 1027.04] and and I predict that that P that comes
[1023.68 - 1030.32] on it it'll be like so then Biryani is
[1027.04 - 1031.64] too heavy for you mute mute mute I'm not
[1030.32 - 1034.00] listening to you today so that's going
[1031.64 - 1034.00] to be the
[1034.36 - 1039.60] future yes the wonders of Technology
[1037.20 - 1042.36] Ryan wheat and maida form the cracks of
[1039.60 - 1045.76] the Indian diet here in this book of
[1042.36 - 1047.32] yours you talk of avoiding these I'm
[1045.76 - 1048.92] certain most of us here would like to
[1047.32 - 1050.88] know why and how
[1048.92 - 1052.52] followed by what alterations we need to
[1050.88 - 1054.96] make in our diets to supplement the
[1052.52 - 1059.08] benefits of wheat and
[1054.96 - 1060.92] gluten so you know like anybody in the
[1059.08 - 1063.52] room I'm first
[1060.92 - 1064.60] human then I became a nutritionist and
[1063.52 - 1068.80] then I got
[1064.60 - 1072.28] confused okay why did I confused
[1068.80 - 1075.72] because people say is this food good or
[1072.28 - 1078.88] is this food not good I I believe you
[1075.72 - 1080.80] should approach food like a judge you
[1078.88 - 1082.72] see if you go into a Court rule you have
[1080.80 - 1085.80] a defense attorney and you have a
[1082.72 - 1087.80] prosecuting attorney so
[1085.80 - 1091.40] imagine there
[1087.80 - 1094.36] was father sitting in front of us you're
[1091.40 - 1096.52] the defense attorney I'm the prosecution
[1094.36 - 1098.12] there should be the audience here is the
[1096.52 - 1101.20] judge
[1098.12 - 1105.08] now if you suddenly say that maida is
[1101.20 - 1108.00] not good you are becoming
[1105.08 - 1110.96] a if you say no no no MAA is very good
[1108.00 - 1113.76] you be the defender everybody should
[1110.96 - 1117.64] behave with the food in their body as a
[1113.76 - 1117.64] judge have an
[1117.72 - 1122.44] independent
[1119.36 - 1126.08] Cod of does this food agree with me or
[1122.44 - 1127.96] does not agree with me so when I looked
[1126.08 - 1131.20] at all the foods on the
[1127.96 - 1133.96] planet a lot of the inflammatory
[1131.20 - 1137.56] conditions were coming also in
[1133.96 - 1140.80] Daily and weit now I didn't write a book
[1137.56 - 1145.32] on milk because I probably would have
[1140.80 - 1147.20] got a assassination letter or a Hitman
[1145.32 - 1149.04] letter saying that the milk power lob is
[1147.20 - 1151.96] too powerful in the country please don't
[1149.04 - 1156.16] assassinate milk but jokes are
[1151.96 - 1159.44] far weeds traditionally C company meat
[1156.16 - 1161.04] was only this tall about 6 in I believe
[1159.44 - 1165.32] through genetic modification with
[1161.04 - 1168.64] grasses that have Bren uh gluten the two
[1165.32 - 1171.84] diin and gluten have somehow changed the
[1168.64 - 1174.88] complexity of the way this molecule of
[1171.84 - 1178.08] gluten exists in let's say me MAA which
[1174.88 - 1181.24] gives beautiful properties of uh
[1178.08 - 1184.04] softness tension all of that stuff and
[1181.24 - 1186.36] so one maybe somewhere in an
[1184.04 - 1189.04] evolutionary point of view the Indian
[1186.36 - 1193.08] subcontinent did not grow that much of
[1189.04 - 1196.04] wheat if you go back into history we
[1193.08 - 1198.60] more of milet and rice and less of wheat
[1196.04 - 1201.08] no because somehow there was an Green
[1198.60 - 1204.48] Revolution this came in and then as a
[1201.08 - 1208.04] nutritionist I'm reading a lot of this
[1204.48 - 1209.92] require more glyco phosphates and get
[1208.04 - 1212.24] rid of the weeds and then that's coming
[1209.92 - 1216.04] into our system insecticides pesticides
[1212.24 - 1218.88] Etc all of those things so I am not
[1216.04 - 1222.92] saying that in wheat or maida or dry
[1218.88 - 1226.80] orani which contain are for I wrote this
[1222.92 - 1228.68] book cuz I had adult acne all my life
[1226.80 - 1231.68] till 36 years of age
[1228.68 - 1236.40] till I went and did the genetic testing
[1231.68 - 1238.80] and found out that I asum Goan 50% Goan
[1236.40 - 1238.80] dad's a
[1238.92 - 1244.16] Taman I'm not supposed to eat bread but
[1241.96 - 1247.36] I was dra born and brought up on eating
[1244.16 - 1250.20] bread at breakfast lunch and dinner
[1247.36 - 1252.24] so when you go home to your mom and your
[1250.20 - 1253.88] mom says k cut you're not a big sh your
[1252.24 - 1256.24] I fed you this food all your life you
[1253.88 - 1259.72] just eat the bread I don't I don't eat
[1256.24 - 1261.76] at home at all I don't go home at all if
[1259.72 - 1263.80] I go home I'm like Mom Mom it's no time
[1261.76 - 1265.16] my mom doesn't go and this time when I
[1263.80 - 1267.92] went home to go I didn't dat a single
[1265.16 - 1272.40] minute she she will me the bread how do
[1267.92 - 1274.68] you convince culturally your mother your
[1272.40 - 1277.72] family your friends your society that
[1274.68 - 1279.88] this food doesn't agree with
[1277.72 - 1281.89] me but that person not sitting and
[1279.88 - 1283.88] holding your hand next to the toilet
[1281.89 - 1287.04] [Laughter]
[1283.88 - 1289.92] no so the whole idea of the writing the
[1287.04 - 1291.72] book was to let people know that hey
[1289.92 - 1294.44] there's something in this story over
[1291.72 - 1296.40] here let me check it out and I believe
[1294.44 - 1299.00] for every 10 Indians maybe three are
[1296.40 - 1300.84] sensitive to gluten maybe seven are not
[1299.00 - 1303.32] so as I said earlier I wrote the wrong
[1300.84 - 1306.28] book but if I can help three people
[1303.32 - 1307.52] figure that out and not get adult acne
[1306.28 - 1310.12] and have to suffer through it their
[1307.52 - 1312.88] whole life there's something allergic
[1310.12 - 1316.12] ritis children with deficient immune
[1312.88 - 1319.20] system if your kids get frequent
[1316.12 - 1321.12] cavities just do the gluten DNA test if
[1319.20 - 1323.84] you find out that K allergic to gluten
[1321.12 - 1325.32] suddenly the cavi stop so I written
[1323.84 - 1329.20] about this in the book and these are
[1325.32 - 1332.28] small Snippets that have been taken from
[1329.20 - 1335.32] just observation so people say where is
[1332.28 - 1338.24] the scientific proof and I just have
[1335.32 - 1342.76] this one thought which is my scientific
[1338.24 - 1345.60] proof is not 10,000 people in a in a
[1342.76 - 1347.80] specialized trial it's you sitting in
[1345.60 - 1349.52] front of me telling me all your symptoms
[1347.80 - 1351.20] I I give the best possible diet and I
[1349.52 - 1353.40] keep observing you for 6 months to one
[1351.20 - 1355.84] year and if I see improvements I keep
[1353.40 - 1357.96] that in my head and then as you keep
[1355.84 - 1360.64] working with people you suddenly begin
[1357.96 - 1363.28] to form patterns or Trends and that's
[1360.64 - 1366.24] where you know you sit as a judge and
[1363.28 - 1370.52] you figure out should I convict gluten
[1366.24 - 1373.12] as you know guity or not
[1370.52 - 1375.32] guen going further what is food
[1373.12 - 1378.92] intolerance and how does a lay man go
[1375.32 - 1383.20] about discovering and avoiding it
[1378.92 - 1385.36] you see you don't eat out of seasonality
[1383.20 - 1387.12] anymore you don't know if you can go
[1385.36 - 1389.48] back to your grandmothers or great
[1387.12 - 1392.72] grandmother's time they got certain
[1389.48 - 1394.24] fruits like for example I asked for
[1392.72 - 1397.32] orange juice today in the hotel and I
[1394.24 - 1400.12] got orange juice I'm in the city of
[1397.32 - 1402.56] oranges right but there's a season so I
[1400.12 - 1404.56] was told it's not the season but you
[1402.56 - 1407.72] still have on orang is available which
[1404.56 - 1410.56] means I can still consume it so forood
[1407.72 - 1414.24] in tolerance arises when I believe that
[1410.56 - 1417.16] you give too much of the same food every
[1414.24 - 1420.56] day and you got up sometimes say I'm fed
[1417.16 - 1423.40] up of this and the security systems in
[1420.56 - 1425.60] your intestinal barrier begin to break
[1423.40 - 1427.48] down and you get an absorption of
[1425.60 - 1429.40] certain foods that able to cross into
[1427.48 - 1430.40] your bloodstream and suddenly start
[1429.40 - 1433.56] slapping
[1430.40 - 1436.08] you so when it start start slapping you
[1433.56 - 1439.16] which is what I call as a juga antigen
[1436.08 - 1441.80] antibody reaction we tend to get these
[1439.16 - 1445.88] alarming signals from the
[1441.80 - 1448.20] body no lock no sinus you know Mal
[1445.88 - 1450.20] absorption of vitamins and minerals so
[1448.20 - 1453.60] when you look at all of these things
[1450.20 - 1456.64] eating almonds every morning every day
[1453.60 - 1459.56] for five years may not be the right
[1456.64 - 1464.20] thing because does an Armen tree grow on
[1459.56 - 1465.68] NP no why would you eat arm for 360 no
[1464.20 - 1468.96] my grandmother said five AR are very
[1465.68 - 1473.40] good for the bread so
[1468.96 - 1476.36] I'm not Prosecuting alond I'm saying the
[1473.40 - 1480.00] way you been meting is too much on the
[1476.36 - 1483.52] same phone too long too often get in
[1480.00 - 1486.96] seasonality so yeah intolerance to the
[1483.52 - 1488.84] for in I'll give you a simple example
[1486.96 - 1492.44] when I did my blood
[1488.84 - 1494.80] test for food and Dons eggs came on the
[1492.44 - 1497.32] list I love eating eggs I had eggs this
[1494.80 - 1498.60] morning but I will not do it more than
[1497.32 - 1501.52] one a
[1498.60 - 1504.60] week so Monday till next Saturday I will
[1501.52 - 1505.84] not touch egg because if I I get a
[1504.60 - 1508.28] pimple or
[1505.84 - 1510.16] two but like but Ryan how do you know
[1508.28 - 1512.16] you got a pimple because of eggs because
[1510.16 - 1514.84] the blood test stole me and then I
[1512.16 - 1517.60] purposely ate eggs for seven days and I
[1514.84 - 1519.96] like oh I got pimples and then I didn't
[1517.60 - 1523.40] Dr the eggs for green no pimple then
[1519.96 - 1525.68] again I ate EG oh I got a pimple so food
[1523.40 - 1528.56] intolerance is something that everyone
[1525.68 - 1531.96] can discover on their own by simple
[1528.56 - 1534.28] things like fasting you fast we have
[1531.96 - 1536.84] forgotten the art of fasting our
[1534.28 - 1538.64] ancestors did fasting in every religion
[1536.84 - 1540.56] in Christianity we did fasting in
[1538.64 - 1543.92] Hinduism you did fasting in Islam you
[1540.56 - 1548.20] did fasting why don't we fast anymore
[1543.92 - 1551.36] it's because life has become so fast and
[1548.20 - 1553.52] L why is because our ancestors our
[1551.36 - 1556.00] ancestors knew that fasting was
[1553.52 - 1557.96] something to reset your gut to remove
[1556.00 - 1559.76] the bombardment of food so I think
[1557.96 - 1564.36] that's one way you can avoid the food to
[1559.76 - 1566.56] it's by fasting in my book is actually
[1564.36 - 1569.80] from a perspective it was picking up one
[1566.56 - 1572.08] topic as I say I didn't feel there was a
[1569.80 - 1573.80] resource out there to help people
[1572.08 - 1575.60] understand it really well in fact a
[1573.80 - 1577.08] daughter came to me and said sir I gave
[1575.60 - 1579.20] your book to my mother and then she
[1577.08 - 1581.92] understood that why she needs to remove
[1579.20 - 1586.16] it from my diet I'm a huge believer in
[1581.92 - 1588.72] mixing up the diet okay but at the same
[1586.16 - 1591.92] time when somebody says I do the nine
[1588.72 - 1594.88] Green Mix or four Health Green Mix or I
[1591.92 - 1599.36] do joar and vaja or I do this mixer and
[1594.88 - 1603.04] not let me say one thing no
[1599.36 - 1607.04] grain has got the accurate nutritional
[1603.04 - 1609.08] value in it meaning Jo are grown out
[1607.04 - 1612.96] this part of the world and Jo are grown
[1609.08 - 1616.32] in let's say utar Pradesh there will be
[1612.96 - 1619.52] nutritional a variances in that so
[1616.32 - 1622.12] whenever you do mix of any
[1619.52 - 1624.44] green the first thing you look for in a
[1622.12 - 1624.44] kid
[1632.88 - 1639.16] is how was your party was a part good
[1635.48 - 1641.16] was your party bad right so you come to
[1639.16 - 1643.96] looking at clinical symptoms if you want
[1641.16 - 1646.00] to go into deep diet feed your kids that
[1643.96 - 1648.04] for 6 months look at the weight of the
[1646.00 - 1650.20] king look at the height of the king
[1648.04 - 1651.68] and if possible do a genetic test if
[1650.20 - 1654.12] possible do a blood test and you can't
[1651.68 - 1657.04] do any of this just look like a ancestor
[1654.12 - 1660.20] the kid is feeling good K not farting up
[1657.04 - 1662.12] the hours it's absolutely fine for me to
[1660.20 - 1664.12] pick one super food or one super
[1662.12 - 1665.68] combination I don't think any nutrition
[1664.12 - 1669.04] should be doing that the nutrition
[1665.68 - 1669.04] should be going in the philosophy
[1672.32 - 1677.08] is very very important and the mummies
[1675.12 - 1679.40] are the people who buy the food that's
[1677.08 - 1682.52] the most important thing toing with zato
[1679.40 - 1685.56] swingy and also will due respect to all
[1682.52 - 1688.52] the women in the room while you hold a
[1685.56 - 1692.12] ker and manage the kitchen which may not
[1688.52 - 1694.96] be true about our elders our elders and
[1692.12 - 1698.16] the moms handle the kitchen this
[1694.96 - 1700.44] transition has got into the convenience
[1698.16 - 1702.76] of the kitchen convenience of the
[1700.44 - 1703.76] kitchen you rely on Brands to tell you
[1702.76 - 1706.20] what is
[1703.76 - 1708.32] good right so I'm sure many of you are
[1706.20 - 1714.04] watching that somebody some brand will
[1708.32 - 1717.68] claim ke 4tify joar flower with healthy
[1714.04 - 1719.56] XY Z and look at it it's only 1% so I
[1717.68 - 1722.68] think it's the responsibility of mothers
[1719.56 - 1726.40] to look at the nutritional ingredient
[1722.68 - 1729.12] and then look at I don't know n the
[1726.40 - 1731.08] blood group the blood test your culture
[1729.12 - 1734.12] what your kid is into what is your kids
[1731.08 - 1736.00] profile all of that stuff I think
[1734.12 - 1738.08] whenever you decide to put a food into
[1736.00 - 1742.28] your body it's like maam what phone do
[1738.08 - 1744.80] you have what phone do you use OnePlus I
[1742.28 - 1747.32] have a OnePlus he has an iPhone what
[1744.80 - 1750.60] phone do you use I iph everyone has
[1747.32 - 1754.40] different phones me one so food is like
[1750.60 - 1754.40] that he would say no no
[1756.24 - 1762.68] no we have to just figure out like for
[1759.36 - 1765.84] example if I want to be a villain soy
[1762.68 - 1769.88] bean is very bad why you giving soy bean
[1765.84 - 1772.16] so now I'm taking prosecution
[1769.88 - 1774.68] approach I'm not saying who is the
[1772.16 - 1776.64] person getting exposed to soybean maybe
[1774.68 - 1778.64] it is actually good soine is very good
[1776.64 - 1781.60] for men above the age of 45 because it
[1778.64 - 1784.68] drops bad cholesterol because of ganin
[1781.60 - 1786.44] and deadin in it so I like to say one
[1784.68 - 1789.04] food is thumbs up or one food is thumbs
[1786.44 - 1791.92] down I am judge sitting in a room saying
[1789.04 - 1794.60] that boss let me see the patient let me
[1791.92 - 1800.40] see the client and then we decide first
[1794.60 - 1800.40] of all I mean the pre YouTube was our
[1803.72 - 1809.12] grandmother so from generation to
[1805.76 - 1811.84] generation that n got handed down now
[1809.12 - 1815.16] today people who don't go into kitchens
[1811.84 - 1815.16] are also Experts of
[1815.24 - 1821.68] nutrition so my thought process is
[1819.72 - 1823.96] entertainment like sometime I get very
[1821.68 - 1826.96] angry recently on LinkedIn there's this
[1823.96 - 1830.32] elderly gentleman I won't take the name
[1826.96 - 1830.32] but he was a finance
[1831.64 - 1838.36] banker and he's getting 6,000 likes
[1834.72 - 1838.36] 6,000 6,000
[1838.48 - 1842.84] shares I'm looking at it and I'm like
[1844.84 - 1851.76] okay so I think again as I said to her
[1849.52 - 1856.04] the reason I have become very successful
[1851.76 - 1858.80] is I refuse to take a sign in general
[1856.04 - 1861.28] consensus I I refuse to create a video
[1858.80 - 1864.80] that will say
[1861.28 - 1867.12] that you have to look at the person and
[1864.80 - 1869.12] buyo individually give advice for that
[1867.12 - 1871.12] one person so I think that's the
[1869.12 - 1872.44] approach and for all the dietitians or
[1871.12 - 1875.08] nutritionist in the
[1872.44 - 1877.76] room artificial intelligence is going to
[1875.08 - 1879.72] take away our jobs from a perspective of
[1877.76 - 1882.52] telling you what's right or wrong in the
[1879.72 - 1886.56] bio individuality marrying all the test
[1882.52 - 1888.48] and bio so diet plan Automatic by
[1886.56 - 1891.12] technology
[1888.48 - 1894.72] you want to be in this profession become
[1891.12 - 1894.72] a great health
[1895.32 - 1900.68] counselor analyze because the human race
[1899.16 - 1903.24] I'm telling you will not follow the
[1900.68 - 1905.88] watch or the phone for a diet plan it
[1903.24 - 1909.44] needs motivation because the biggest
[1905.88 - 1914.16] Tempest on the planet is your taste
[1909.44 - 1914.16] buds I'll tell you eat this food
[1914.88 - 1920.56] T so the most important thing is watch
[1918.04 - 1924.44] your taste parts listen to YouTube with
[1920.56 - 1926.40] a pinch of salt the human race has genes
[1924.44 - 1929.56] in It software code is there in the
[1926.40 - 1934.16] human body so you have something known
[1929.56 - 1937.64] as Mt HFR Gene let's call it anti
[1934.16 - 1941.20] mtfr this ATI Gene may be on or off in
[1937.64 - 1944.64] people if the Auntie is on it is able to
[1941.20 - 1946.08] take vitamin B9 and convert vitamin B9
[1944.64 - 1949.08] into security
[1946.08 - 1949.08] gar
[1950.48 - 1955.64] goes inside your bloodstream and starts
[1951.96 - 1958.00] slapping cholesterol
[1955.64 - 1960.36] cherol so cholesterol gets very scared
[1958.00 - 1962.64] and goes to the side and forms
[1960.36 - 1968.12] flock so to
[1962.64 - 1968.12] control you need more me
[1971.28 - 1974.28] fatey
[1976.04 - 1982.36] Dy
[1977.76 - 1987.12] mtfr gen down then your processing of
[1982.36 - 1987.12] methy folate is very low home assist
[1987.92 - 1994.44] says and then the H goes up slaps
[1991.96 - 1996.36] cholesterol and creates a high formation
[1994.44 - 1998.36] of the book so it's a very good qu I had
[1996.36 - 2000.84] a running coach coming to me ah run run
[1998.36 - 2003.56] run running coach huh runs half a dozen
[2000.84 - 2008.96] marathons in the year gets
[2003.56 - 2008.96] Vlogs his MTF mommy daddy
[2013.56 - 2019.56] so you got that so thetion the
[2016.48 - 2023.96] assumption that physical activity
[2019.56 - 2027.60] confers a blanket protection on you is
[2023.96 - 2029.04] suspect which is why I tell people you
[2027.60 - 2034.80] can't
[2029.04 - 2037.60] outrun a bad diet you can't out bad
[2034.80 - 2040.72] genetics but you can change it don't
[2037.60 - 2043.84] drink coffee because because coffee
[2040.72 - 2047.32] contains caol which raises your homos
[2043.84 - 2050.00] levels get a blood test for vitamin B9
[2047.32 - 2052.48] and b12 or B complex because if these
[2050.00 - 2054.84] are low you could take vegetarian
[2052.48 - 2056.40] supplement from a food
[2054.84 - 2057.92] perspective
[2056.40 - 2062.12] pumpkins
[2057.92 - 2065.16] mustach all foods contain B9 V12 but
[2062.12 - 2067.44] when you take folic acid B9 and your
[2065.16 - 2069.44] anti mtfr is not working thing it will
[2067.44 - 2071.44] not absorb folic acid so you need to
[2069.44 - 2073.64] take a supplement called methy folet I
[2071.44 - 2075.92] would suggest get a blood test done one
[2073.64 - 2078.20] last question from my for B to everyone
[2075.92 - 2080.60] here right how does a person say from
[2078.20 - 2084.08] nagpur get in touch with you and how do
[2080.60 - 2088.68] you take that case forward so obviously
[2084.08 - 2091.12] IND know Google is we why Google running
