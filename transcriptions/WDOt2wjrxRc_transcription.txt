Call us on 9743430000. Celebrity sports nutritionist Ryan Fernando explaining how athletes are putting themselves at a higher risk of injury occurrence by choosing the wrong foods. Right Nutrition education and awareness goes a long way in preventing injuries.
The only thing that can stop an athlete from achieving his/her potential is INJURY. Athletes have shortened career life cycle donâ€™t shorten it further with your bad eating habits.Nutrition intervention should happen instantly after an injury. The athlete should be tested for nutrient deficiencies, energy levels, hydration intake, and sleep practices. The nutrition strategy should be customized to the injury stage of an individual, the resting metabolic rate (RMR), the amount of physical activity and to reduce the fat mass accumulation. Nutrition and the foods you eat play a critical role in injury prevention and recovery. The composition of your diet can have a significant impact on minimizing muscle loss during injury recovery. Inflammation and weight management can also be attributed to the nutrient density of foods you eat. An inflammatory response that aids in healing is the initial phase in the damage recovery process. Temporary inflammation is a normal and necessary part of the healing process for bone and tissue injuries, so it's not a bad thing! Swelling is a common side effect of this process, which starts right after the injury. A nutrition intervention to reduce inflammation may or may not be required, depending on the severity of the damage.

Transcript: if you're watching this video then you could get nature and if you get injured that's the end of your career I'm talking with every sports person out there but they are 5 years old or 15 years old 25 years old injury is could be the end of your career so sometimes it is or it could be but just might take on entry and athlete gets injured because the cells in the body are under stress now every athlete subjects themselves to hours and hours of training so when a cell is their human body it has energy reserves the energy reserves are in the form of the carbohydrate the protein and the fact the structure of a cell is predominantly based on the cellular material and a key component is water so for me and the sports nutritionist its hydration so if we can take care of hydration and most athletes get dehydrated did you know that an average athlete loses 1 percent of their body weight during one to two hours of sports performance by the time you've lost 2% you're lost nearly 30% of mental cognition it is during these periods of daily training where your body hydration index starts dropping when it starts dropping obviously you know your muscles require electrolytes and it likes are found in the water inside these cells the electrolytes are love or the on and off of the muscle which is the contraction and the relaxation of the muscle so when the signal goes haywire the muscles become tightened when a muscle gets tightened you're stretching you're jumping you're leaping you're sprinting you could stretch the muscle beyond the boundaries of its comfort zone now how does nutrition work so physiotherapists and I would say biomechanics that is where the positive short long tight loose you know is it is it bio mechanically aligned not aligned there's so much that you know you can learn with a good physiotherapist and a pile of sports biomechanics expert but beyond that from injury I believe the food we put into your body as soon as you finish training there is a window of recovery from 1 to 3 hours for example muscle like a change let me give you a simple example muscle glycogen is non-insulin recoverable at the first hour which means the weight of your body that much amount of glucose should be banged into your body within half an hour finishing training and can fail and there's one more secret molecule I don't give out all the secrets helps in replenishment of black lives and even faster now what it like this it is not replenished faster one molecule of glycogen is t2 2 whole 3 molecules of glycogen when you put this together if there is a lack of one molecule of language and which is low that these three molecules of language and I are saying water hydration what happened dream of Monica to water initial never to boom it's not dead so your cell is less hydrated less hydrated means the moon less nutrition coming in water moves the best friend the water what does best friend is glucose what a best friend is vitamins what has been spent is minerals all the nutrients are what has been spent so when you want to bring it into the cell glucose is a key key component so when nutrition is not taken care of injury sensing from a simple thing of not having glucose now let me give another example your ligaments your cartilage tradition all of these require certain are my assets now those are - is what come from a protein they come from your bone broth soup they come from your collagen peptide they come from your hyaluronic acid glucosamine MSM you need to deliver these raw material to the human body so when athletes want to prevent injury having a carefully balanced nutrition program is a key to having a longer shelf life as an athlete you wanna play for 20 years injury free the idea is to get your nutrition to perfection you do not slip up you do not have cheat meals you have perfection because every day you are subjecting your body to physical emotional torture that torture is dependent on the recovery your recovery is very very good if you have the right food going into your body you have the 9 supplements work the body and when you have the right kind of nutrition going the body the next step is that right quantities and then the third step is the right tiny when you put all of these together you have affection when it comes to nutrition and prevention of things d what happens if you get injured over here when you get injured you have damaged tissue and you have scar tissue forming now let me just explain this very very simply I'm not going to go to huge scientific terms imagine you have a house okay my room is a brave one one like I break the wall so I've broken the wall I want to put a new window in on the wall and everything now that makes the wall right should I break the wall and then call up the contractor was what is your charge how much is Briggs will you repair my wall or will you get glass that would take me five six days to get everything put together but before you do a project of breaking down the wall you keep all of these not material to keep the contractor ready so the moment you finish bring another one boom within 24 hours you close the top and wheeled it up that's easy for you you get injured your body has all of these miraculous genetic molecules that your body is designed to heal you cut yourself when you see within two weeks you're healed back up again so we have all these molecules inside of us but in a sports injury microscopic trauma happens every day inside your muscle inside your tissue inside your ligament inside your cartilage inside your skin outside the skin brazing rivet everywhere injuries happening everything depends on the good quality raw material being available so let me give an example I remember once I had heard in the past singer squash player calling me from the ambulance after he had a hamstring care so uniquely I told Bobby you can you can change you can probably you get opus cabbage if you do this you do this you get hydration you get one secret molecule that I want you to get which is completely we could put all of this together and I want you having this for the next 48 hours guess what when the healing is happening they are delivering the correct nutrition in the right quantity and you're preventing scar tissue from formation so I have seen like I remember Chicka the one had a hairline fracture they said you will be out for a considerable period of time I used every possible trick in the nutrition book to help in healing if you google up scholarly articles there are articles right from collagen gelatin not CV gelatin but animal gelatin on how it helps in repairing bone matrix cartilage matrix there are these research papers but why don't we advocate them well because medicine has been practiced for so long so when you have an injury take an anti-inflammatory reduce inflammation so you don't want that is like saying here a broken window no let me call the security guard and let him stand outside the anti-inflammatory is not the contractor who's going to repair that place the painkiller is not the contractor going to repair that place it's your vitamins your minerals your amino acids your fatty acids the good fatty acid which are going to help in rebuild the matrix back again so what happens is when you get injured oh I got injured now I don't need to eat according to my plan eat whatever food I want to eat guess what you've now put on five degrees because of an injury so when you come back here to work double hard but your mitochondria has decreased in every cell because you've taken the data off for five weeks so you have to work even harder with extra weight and guess what you might just miss the slot of going to the Olympics so you know people take it so laid back you know I got injured I want to come to you for nutrition three weeks later three months later I I can't take names but there are so many famous athletes who said oh I'll come to you later I'm like dude what's wrong with you you're in a light vehicle your engine is broken you need to put the light fuel to recover that engine know what you think what I mean sure I can take a break I can go for a holiday to do all of these things doesn't work you're committed to be an athlete once in your life you have but a lifetime of ten years maybe if you are lucky to not get injured problem is in India they're still debating whether we should do nutrition whilst the world has gone and hated nutrition is the basic foundation the corner headed to performance nutrition performance supplementation tracking of heart rates tracking of enzymes everything possible on with the Sun so my videos was about nutrition because I'm supposed to just get cracking you want to prevent an injury it's a shame you got an injury you know some of you got injured right now pick up the phone and get it done your plan needs to activate dynamically at the time of injury the next 48 hours are crucial I can't stress this enough but if you want to save your career if you ever get injured please remember this video pick up the phone call us at quantitation calm and let's see how we can help you
