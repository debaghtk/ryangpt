[0.08 - 4.88] are you someone who will crack a can
[2.60 - 7.04] without washing the lid off this is your
[4.88 - 8.92] favorite can y look at it you just take
[7.04 - 10.64] it buy it from the supermarket and you
[8.92 - 11.96] drink directly from it now this is an
[10.64 - 13.80] experiment where they're taking a swab
[11.96 - 16.00] and transferring it to a petri dish
[13.80 - 18.16] which contains agar AAR to see if
[16.00 - 20.84] bacteria virus fungus all of these
[18.16 - 23.04] things grow now first one no wiping
[20.84 - 25.40] second one with your shirt and third one
[23.04 - 26.80] with an alcohol swipe and now they're
[25.40 - 29.16] putting it in a specialized
[26.80 - 31.20] microbiological grow chamber and this
[29.16 - 33.56] plate is held for 2 to 3 days and we
[31.20 - 35.60] will see the growth of virus bacteria on
[33.56 - 37.60] that plate from that swap there are four
[35.60 - 39.96] options number one there was no cleaning
[37.60 - 41.92] of the can and look at the growth number
[39.96 - 43.88] two you clean it with your shirt like
[41.92 - 46.04] everybody else there is some growth and
[43.88 - 47.88] if you're OCD like me number three where
[46.04 - 50.20] you clean it with alcohol or washed it
[47.88 - 52.00] look at it no growth at all so the next
[50.20 - 53.80] time you see a can like this instead of
[52.00 - 56.60] your shirt wipe it down or wash it
[53.80 - 56.60] that's even better
