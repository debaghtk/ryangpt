Transcript: hi I'm chef Nicola national rifle shooter and I have been working with one nutritionist specifically with Ryan and Abigail for the last year so during the course of the last year I have seen my performance improve and I have also learned a few things along the way so one of them is that I have now I'm very clear about what I should and shouldn't be eating as a shooter I've also learned the benefits of a few foods and the role they play in my overall nutrition a thing that I really liked was that Ryan and Abigail didn't only focus on the nutrition part of it but also focused on other aspects of what I would need to do to be a better shooter such as exercises for keeping the heart rate low and the breathing slow and steady I've also understood the value of good nutrition in a sports person's life so yeah these were the few of the things that I've learned over the last year and I will definitely be implementing and keeping them in mind in the future and also like to thank Ryan and Abigail for guiding me throughout this last year so yes thank you
