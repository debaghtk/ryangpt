[0.00 - 4.14] and there is great pressure on this from
[2.04 - 6.72] all directions to start giving knowledge
[4.14 - 9.00] to the children so is it actually a
[6.72 - 12.44] prerequisite that you know uh to be a
[9.00 - 12.44] sports person you need to have knowledge
[12.66 - 16.86] this is a very cultural and religious
[14.88 - 19.32] question to answer
[16.86 - 22.20] my answer as a nutritionist
[19.32 - 24.24] is no you don't need to change okay I
[22.20 - 26.22] won two Olympic medals with a pure
[24.24 - 28.80] vegetarian sushil Kumar
[26.22 - 31.86] he convinced me that when I do the
[28.80 - 34.20] protocol correctly you can find elements
[31.86 - 36.78] in vegetarian diet now let me tell you
[34.20 - 39.12] why people turn to non-vegetarian
[36.78 - 41.82] the convenience of non-vegetarian and
[39.12 - 43.80] Global competitions is easier so like I
[41.82 - 46.26] have two of my athletes who just
[43.80 - 48.42] finished the world University games in
[46.26 - 51.12] China and he says sir it's so difficult
[48.42 - 52.56] to get vegetarian food last three years
[51.12 - 54.48] has been easy because of this vegan
[52.56 - 57.18] Revolution yeah yeah so it has begun to
[54.48 - 59.28] happen so he is not going to have a
[57.18 - 62.04] problem being a vegetarian when he
[59.28 - 64.08] travels for tournaments there are one or
[62.04 - 66.24] two benefits being a non-vegetarian in
[64.08 - 69.30] terms of the density and quality of
[66.24 - 71.58] protein you can eat lesser non-veg and
[69.30 - 75.44] get higher protein whereas in vegetarian
[71.58 - 78.06] you have to eat more quantity okay
[75.44 - 80.88] whereas non-veg if he eats just 100
[78.06 - 84.06] grams he gets a better quantity of
[80.88 - 85.86] protein nearly 10 20 more Also non-match
[84.06 - 88.44] may have creatinine carnosine which are
[85.86 - 90.90] lactic acid buffers so you need to
[88.44 - 93.06] figure out as a family is your
[90.90 - 95.40] vegetarian bastard one of culture and
[93.06 - 97.98] religion then please keep it
[95.40 - 100.44] but if it's just one of choice
[97.98 - 102.54] allow the athlete at a later stage in
[100.44 - 104.40] life to decide to go in the direction of
[102.54 - 105.48] vegetarian or non-vegetarian but you
[104.40 - 108.78] don't need to be forced in that
[105.48 - 110.76] direction I don't believe that uh you're
[108.78 - 112.50] slower because you're vegetarian I
[110.76 - 114.90] believe you're slower because your diet
[112.50 - 115.98] is not planned understood and therefore
[114.90 - 118.20] you're missing out on the right
[115.98 - 120.06] nutrition in vegetarian food and get it
[118.20 - 122.46] planned I can make them in an Olympic
[120.06 - 124.56] medal it's as simple as that
[122.46 - 126.48] so you've just watched the video where
[124.56 - 128.16] I've explained to your parents whether
[126.48 - 130.92] they need to convert from a vegetarian
[128.16 - 133.32] to a non-vegetarian diet I genuinely
[130.92 - 134.76] believe after two Olympic medals with
[133.32 - 137.46] sushil Kumar and having worked with
[134.76 - 140.04] Virat Kohli vegetarians do not need to
[137.46 - 142.26] become non-vegetarians you can remain in
[140.04 - 144.36] your spiritual and cultural requirements
[142.26 - 146.94] of being a vegetarian now how do we do
