[0.00 - 5.52] you know my wife says I'm very
[2.52 - 5.52] insensitive
[6.24 - 9.88] dode did not eat correctly my wife's
[8.44 - 11.68] like how can you be so insensitive there
[9.88 - 13.72] is documented research from American
[11.68 - 15.20] prisons on violence and suicide they
[13.72 - 17.04] actually took two prison blocks in
[15.20 - 18.36] Brazil or America somewhere Australia I
[17.04 - 19.92] remember reading the scientific paper so
[18.36 - 22.64] they fed them omega-3 and removed the
[19.92 - 24.00] bad fats and uh a multivitamin another
[22.64 - 26.40] block they didn't do anything the
[24.00 - 28.88] incidences of violence came down by over
[26.40 - 30.52] 55% incidences of suicidal tendency
[28.88 - 32.92] dropped almost 90%
[30.52 - 34.68] so when I see employees sad in an
[32.92 - 36.36] organization maybe it's the stimulus of
[34.68 - 38.20] the people around them but what if it's
[36.36 - 39.96] biological what if the fault is that
[38.20 - 42.48] you're not eating correctly what is it
[39.96 - 43.96] if the fault is that you do not know
[42.48 - 45.80] that your grandmother and grandfather
[43.96 - 50.04] did the wrong Jordy and brought into
[45.80 - 50.04] your family an omega-3 deficient Gene
