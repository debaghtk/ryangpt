Transcript: hey guys if you're not able to watch my long form content of podcast here are some short form clips for you to enjoy there are a lot of myths about skin care there are a lot of certified influencers that are there now today on Instagram which come and troll you and me and they think they know it everything they just have a camera and then they have a mic and then they're talking about as if they know the world but they don't have a clinical practice scary what are some of the common myths that are out there or Hocus Pocus stuff that makes your blood boil when you hear about it see today I should say the bloggers also read up a lot so they sound intelligent and they tell you the right things so they may not be much depth if you really to to sound intelligent but you don't have the clinical practice no depth and no clinical practice no degrees so that's something which you need to be very clear of who you're listening to or who you're who you're even as a completely qualified doctor there are a lot of times people get angry with me because I don't suggest a product but I can't how will I suggest a product online which one is the best sunscreen what kind of a question is that I can't tell you because I don't know your skin type I don't know your sun exposure I don't know where you live Ryan Fernando can you recommend a diet plan yeah hello I don't know your gender I don't know your age I don't know your body fat percentage and then I'm angry you only do it for celebrities you don't do it for me you can't do free for me I'm a poor person and everything so the same same page and then something I would have applied they say which one are you applying but that's for my skin so like that what boils me is when people end up coming so SK is bioindividual very very so one person could use a sunscreen and another person could use a sunscreen and they could have two different effects on the skin so even you're like looking at the skin and saying okay you can't use this sunscreen you got to use this sunscreen yeah ah I just thought it was SPF SPF is a general thing there are many factors that you see in a sunscreen SPF is one tell us a little bit about it because you got a lot of sun is going to it's only going to get hotter heat wave is coming up heat wave is coming up so right from the kids to older people talk to us about skincare routine um you know the free tips to everyone out there who listening in we got Dr Rashmi in here to me she's this she's the verat kohi of Dermatology so she's like hitting everything out of the let's get some free tips from her what what would you recommend from a skincare routine point of view I remember her hearing ctm yeah cleans started off in life yeah CM but I'm too lazy to do it so where would you take skincare routine for one of us so like you said the first thing for skin is hygiene I would start right from there so your scalp hygiene is included in skin hygiene so very very important so you need to have a clean a lot of times teenagers come to me with acne and these days teenagers are so paranoid about losing their hair mhm there's also early graying early balding that we see right so they are all oh yeah Big T as compared to like 10 years ago this is huge right now so therefore for they scared to wash their hair they think washing hair leads to hair fall which is a big myth not at all keep your scalp clean say that again from me washing hair will not lead to hairfall at all in fact accumulation of your dandruff your sebum your dirt on your scalp will lead to inflammation which leads to hair fall that's a sixer right now yeah because everyone's saying today I don't want wash my hair don't wash your hair and everything no not the doctor says you got to wash your hair but how do we do it yes so depends on scalp type okay so if you have a very dry scalp how do you know the difference between dry scalp and a and dandruff is my NE is your next question so I'm preempting it so if you have a dry scalp you will know that the day you wash your hair mhm immediately once you dry it it starts getting flaky it start getting itchy and a little sensitive um and then if someone kind of opens up your hair and sees the scalp it may feel a little red as well so now this you know is dry scalp flakiness so then you don't wash your hair every day you can wash it alternate day so that some oil can accumulate there wait for it to kind of accumulate but if you have an oily scalp then you can wash your scalp every single day with your chosen shampoo now if you do have dandruff then again you need to wash it every single day so you're not not accumulating the yeast and the fat of your skin which is with the skin of the scalp is putting out that's the food for the East so you're going to kill both so you're going to wash it off every day this is what you do now if you have we only talking about scalp right now so if you have a scalp a certain way and a hair a certain way most people end up asking do my scalp scalp is oily but my hair is dry now what do I do so that's when you wash your scalp with the said shampoo every single day and you don't have to shampoo your hair at all hair is dry hair is not dirty we're all in AC closed environments so you wash your hair just so that you get some hydration and shine on it once in a week with the shampoo but you shampoo your scalp every day and put conditioner for the hair and come out of the bath so this is what you would wash your hair and your scalp separately anti- dander shampoo can only go on the scalp but a hydrating shampoo can go on your hair so that's how you look for hair and scalp shampoo so that is scalp hygiene now skin hygiene depends again on your skin type now whatever is your skin you're having a bath I prefer a liquid soap to a solid soap only because you don't keep pulling applying putting it back and again picking up applying putting it back what's the logic there is it's a soap right and you're touching it on your skin there could be germs there could be dust accumulating do we wash our soap before really using two three people might use the same same thing in the house I just feel it is a little unhygienic concept about it though the whole world Liv my brain going like yeah I feel uh personally it's it's it's not something that I want to touch put back touch put back so it's easy to take it out of a dispenser use it and you're done what is sitting inside is still untouched right true so true and if 10 people in a house use one bathroom for example not all 10 are using the same soap and putting it back so you and the soap dishes sitting sometimes I've seen there'll be a soap dish there'll be a soap with a lot of water in it so nobody is even cleaning and emptying that so I find that whole thing a little unhygienic so it's easier for something coming out of a tube or a dispenser where you know what's inside is clean so that's the bathing ritual with bathing ritual and bathing how many times twice is okay more than that is not good for skin because you're ripping your own oils off I have a lot of athletes and they train like three four times a day wow okay so this has been my advice to them use the soap once a day on the entire body and in your private parts underarms and all all the body folds all the body folds you do that for body order and the that is two baths and in third or fourth B just use plain water is that okay that's okay maybe if they're athletes you may still want them to use whatever little soaps even at their body folds each time they have a bath because they to sweat it out correct but other than that yeah soap only once okay awesome awesome is there any other skincare routine that we now get into Beyond bathing yeah so I think hygiene wise this is what that you need to be very careful about and washing the face would again be not more than two times if you really have an oily skin than the third time I've seen a lot of people say oh but I'm just washing with water hey guys if you've enjoyed this clip then click here and watch the full episode and don't forget to subscribe because your body is the
