Transcript: hi good morning my name is ryan fernando and you and i today are going to walk through your gut this is a video for all the people who have any indigestion gas bloating irritable bowel syndrome constipation or anything related to your gut and your brain including anxiety and depression so i want to talk to you about the gut system which starts from the mouth goes down to your esophagus which is the pipeline that goes down the stomach a lot of us have h pylori bacteria acidity uh you know uh ulcers and then you go down into the small intestine where you're not supposed to have too much of bacteria and you get what is known as sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth so a lot of belching and burping which should not technically happen and then you go down to large intestine where your microbiome it's all the bacteria and all that get completely go haywire and stuff like that and you come down to your poop canal where your potty is there you have constipation you have loose motions you have incomplete bowel evacuation and everything from piles fistila hemorrhoids all related to an entire system called the gastrointestinal system so today i want to share with you a report which is all about the microbiome now going forward what i want to do is i want to give you a few insight and if you don't like this video please skip and go away but everybody has a gut system everybody needs to have this education and this knowledge so bear with me with this short video as i educate you on how you can do a crystal ball gazing into your future of your gut which means i'm the astrologer of your gut except this is not hearsay this is scientific now you have 30 trillion cells in the human body related to your rbcs but you have 40 trillion cells which are related to your bacteria so are you bacteria are you a microorganism or your human organism so i do believe that over centuries of evolution we are well evolved to work with the bacteria in nature however with a lot of our industrialization a septic living a lot of chemicals sanitizers pesticides insecticides and also uh antibiotics and things like that we have upset the gut micro of microflora now i want to give you a few insights women are two times as likely to susa to to to suffer from gut issues okay 62 percent of people worldwide suffer from complaints such as digestion constipation i work with children children between the ages of 9 and 16 cannot communicate or are too embarrassed to tell their parents that they are constipated parents are too busy in their jobs to figure out that the children are not pooping on time i keep a record of when my kid goes to poop i sometimes tell him don't flush i want to look at your poop and then as you get older you know when you go to work you get people which who come in very angry if you don't clear your bowel in the morning you're going to be angry and the fault is the parent for not training that kid to have an early morning ball movement so then you know your circadian rhythm which is the body clock to the sunset and sunrise and your poop clock go completely misaligned 95 of serotonin serotonin is what makes you happy serotonin is what makes you calm is synthesized in the gut believe me the number of cases that i get and i'm counseling people and you're sitting across me in zoom or in my nutritional counseling room i can tell you within five minutes whether your your gut is gone just by the words you use people who use positive words have a happy gut so we gotta change your gut to a microbe microbiome good microbiome okay and all of this corona and covered in all everyone's talking about yeah let's put kara let's put vitamin c let's put everything if you can strengthen your gut and i've got secrets to strengthen your gut in today's thing the world is giving a lot of general tips today's video i am talking about the gut microbiome and how do you reprogram it but before you reprogram it you got to test it okay so what could be the things with the microbiome okay so the entire gut could have things gut means stomach small intestine large intestine colon rectum so everything okay you could have gas bloating you could have mental issues brain fog i remember once when um i i did not know that i had an allergy to gluten and dairy i remember i could do like four or five hours of counseling i would always have this brain fog and you know find it difficult so i've always had a dietitian with me like an assist to help me when i my mind starts brain fogging up so this is a public confession right but when i went and did my dna test for gluten and lactose it disappeared so vitamin and mineral deficiencies do you know that the intestine is a beautiful pipeline with lovely uh carpets inside that absorb all the nutrients and i'm doing my fingers like this because they are micro villis so when you eat the wrong foods your beautiful carpet finger like production becomes stubs and so all the nutrition instead of going through and getting caught and absorbed the micro nutrients of vitamins and minerals you get these stubs so all the nutrient just bounces off in your intestine and washes out so you have loose tools loose poop think of it if you have loose explosive uh poop and you don't have beautifully formed stool most of your nutrition is not getting absorbed autoimmune disorders alopecia areata to psoriasis eczema people say so i got psoriasis i got eczema arya beta you take your skin and turn it inside my skin on the outside i turn it inside that's my skin inside my gut if you have skin gut problems inside it's going to show on your outside skin so everything from dandruff to psoriasis to xemia to vitiligo to dry chicken skin i had a lady yesterday saying to me my skin is looking amazing just one week on your diet because we are aligning the gut so a lot of over uh over abuse of you know antibiotics and stress i can't i can't tell you i can't document stress so the problem is if i can't document stress then i scratch my head and say hey you know what let me go and check your microbiome so i feel microbiome is the entire population in your gut all of these bacterias and good guys and the back guys and maybe fungal overgrowth and yeast overgrowth and all of this juggernaut that is like one full city inside your in your in your body and i said it's 40 trillion okay do you need a gut reset so so basically from my perspective to explain to you in very very simple terms you have good bacteria and you have bad bacteria imagine the good bacteria getting that pav bhaji that you ate or that celery that you ate or that carrot that you ate or simple dal chawal roti and the good bacteria says wow let's eat this and we'll produce happy molecules let's produce breakdown of these molecules and give it to the blood the bad bacteria say we are going to ferment this and create some disco molecules in your body and those disco molecules go into your blood and create a disco effect in your body now this might not be good disco that might this might be a lot of bad disco okay so at the end of the day you need to understand when you were younger you didn't have gut problem because this slide is showing you the diversity of the organisms the bacteria dates formicatous actinobacter these are the ratios on how the bacteria could be you will be shocked when i start showing you the microbiome report how people's things go haywire second point anybody above the age of 50 has to do the microbiome test trust me it's the greatest gift you can give to your parents what do i do i need a poop sample poop sample is collected put into a container sent to a lab to me here in bangalore and then we do the dna fingerprinting of the population of bacteria in you i am working right now with an 82 year old person and we are trying to change his entire gut microbiome which is in dysbiosis dysbiosis means it's it's not in good control so let me let me show you the microbiome report okay so this is the microbiome report and and basically this is what we'll get you know there's a gut microbiome index the abundance so let me quickly show you and walk through it if you're getting bored please leave the video if you think this video is valid for your spouse or your brother or your sister who has constant gut problems please share this with them i'm telling you upfront it's 20 000 rupees to do this test but you know what you spend 45 and 60 000 rupees on a computer and that gives you information it makes your life easier the microbiome is going to do exactly that figure out what foods to eat and not to eat so if i can just go through this very very quickly there's an index here so when this person's poop was an alice analyzed it takes three weeks to do it they have got a gut dysbiosis so the gut dysbiosis is meaning that the gut is not healthy now this score is being given by the microbiome lab so what they did is they went in and they found out the ratio like formic it is 65 percent bacteria was 29 actinobacter it was 0.52 so all of this needs to be higher so that it doesn't become bad for the gut okay like total pathogen in this person is eight point five three when it should be lesser than two percent so or as it is i already know that okay this person's gut is imbalance now picture this doctor i got pain in my stomach doctor i got constipation doctor i've not had proposed tools and everything okay prescription where is the analysis of the gut where is the analysis of the poop where is the analysis of your diet we are living in the 21st century which means if you have an issue we are doing testing right if you get coronavirus oh i got coronavirus feeder no you do the rt pcr test when your stomach is hurting and you're constipated what do you do do you do a breath test do you do a saliva test do you do a genetic test do you do a blood test do you do a poop analysis test my suggestion is do the poop microbiome genetic analysis test it will tell you the population of all the bacteria now hang on hang on let's figure out what we have okay we have the list of top bacterial pathogens imagine if you could give this list to your gastroenterologist you know what's the first thing they will say this is not required why because they want to do trial by fire error and give you all the possible broad spectrum antibiotics to get your condition under control but when medicine has advanced i repeat when medical genetics has advanced and our current crop of doctors do not have the genetic training then it's nice for you to take matters into your own hand and ask for microbiome test like a blood test because if you come to know that you have bacteria rights vulgatis we suddenly know there are certain foods that you should not give this person which cause the propagation of these bad bacteria or if you work with the clinical lab that doctor knows exactly which antibiotic they might need to give you for five to ten days to bring this population down but let me tell you something when we work at the coordination clinics we don't do it this way what we do is we work at the gut and look at food so look at the common fungal pathogens i was so happy this person had a fungal infection in the toes and all so we did not have anything in the gut as yet so this it was still on the skin level so pretty pretty good we need to get all of these staphylococcus aureus which is very high so a staph infection how do we bring it down we bring it down with the right herbs we bring it down with the right probiotics we bring it down with the right food so basically what this microbiome report does is it will also tell me all the good bacteria huh so look at the beneficial bacteria 7.425 fecal bacterium prosnutsy okay very very russian name but let's look at it 7.42 this should be around 1560. so once i start getting all of this check out this guy he's got everything low low low low no wonder he's complaining to me about constipation erratic bowel movement uh you know feeling miserable after having a party so we need to change all of these things all of these things we need to change change change and it's a new science it's a new science where the nutritionist says oh you've got all of these good bacteria that don't exist so what should i do what should i do what should i do look at this so many lactobacillus rotary beneficial lactobacillus rutiri and lactobacillus or aminosis both are zero i'll tell you a story they did this research on rats okay sterile that's okay so one group they gave this lactobacillus raminosis and the other group of rats they said no we're not going to feed you anything then boom they throw these rats into the water and told them swim better swim now the guys that got raminosis i think it was ramunosus and plantaris lactobacillus plantarius they swam for 17 percent longer what the scientists concluded that the will to live motivation feel-good factor grit comes from your gut and this gentleman or this lady whose test has come to me has got zero zero so the will to live i believe from the rat study is lower hang on you don't want me to compare it a human body to rat in a rat study clinical study absolutely fine but think about it you're supposed to have in a good person this would be anywhere from two to five percent so there's a lacking that means years of antibiotic abuse bpa abuse uh and diabetes abuse uh heart pressure medication boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom all of that you keep into your body all of these bacteria are going to be saying that i am getting killed by all of these uh bombs dropping on me the the foreign bombs dropping into my body so uh basically what we do is we get into it and the lab comes back to me and says hey you know what in vegetables you can give all of these foods you can avoid these foods so basically what we are doing is we are looking at all the things in the diet and for example under the vegetables we have a gut restoration okay so so for me the gut restoration means a 21 day cycle in that 21 days i can give the foods which say gut maintenance to change the microflora and four months later i do the microbiome test again if you wish but i'm telling you people who have done the microbiome testing begin to see results after four weeks because we have just eliminated things for example i'm not supposed to give this person broccoli and cauliflower in the first 21 days okay and then we go through various foods like i mean come on yeah i mean in in in my right mind for for this client how would i know to avoid carrot potato and tapioca so what is telling me to re-change the gut microflora don't give these foods because it will cause the growth of certain bacteria which are pathogenic and inhibit the growth of the good bacteria like for example i love giving kale or kale is so good it's anti-aging it's got great amount like it's better than spinach blah blue blue blue everything sweet potato yum so it's come across to me that hey don't give this person and i actually for a person have avoided these foods and they are now saying that the gut is actually improving and there are so many things in your dolls like okay so in this person all the dolls they're saying which are the superfoods so you know i can give amaranth buckwheat navy beans don't give quinoa in the first gut restoration phase so uh hey avoid green peas so just one thing there's a filter okay there's a there's a filter which is called the food intolerance and the food allergy report food sensitivity report that's my first filter and then my second filter is a microbiome filter and then my third filter is the genetic filter so greenpeace if they say don't give it in the blood filter i'm like okay blood test no green peas in the microbiome don't grave game please take it out so that way i build a population of foods to give or not to give and i think this is what is called a squa discover the capacity for a person that's my name like clinique nutrition for example in fruits almost everything is there in the list but don't give grapes in the gut restoration avoid banana the person loves banana what do i do oh well you don't eat banana because your microbiome does not like it no but banana is very good for health the entire premise of the universe today is generality when information is being disseminated when it comes to your health learn the concept of kua is it customized to my koa kua means my capacity so i do believe that the future 10 years from now will be custom nutrition custom supplementation custom medication did you know statins you can check for a gene in your body and figure out whether statins work or not work in your body apparently 25 of people also i don't remember the statistics clearly but nearly one fourth of the population do not respond to statins yet we will still do generalized medicine practice so i do believe the future is going to be customization a quan nutrition does that customization and that's the reason i make these videos hoping that you're that person that believes in customization most of the people would have dropped off at two minutes i don't care if you've watched the video till this far number one the money that you spend to customize your diet your nutrition and your health will be the cost of the latest iphone 128 gb uh the max version that's what you would spend but you would have six times the return on the investment unlike when i take my apple laptop and drop it down on the flow and it breaks you will get six times the return on your health by just living longer eating smarter eating healthier pooping better so there's a lot of stuff that is there in this report okay like in this person i'm not supposed to give palm oil one is putty all your food that you order from zomato and swiggy which is outside the restaurants they're not using expensive oil they're not cooking with coconut oil they're not cooking with olive oil it's too expensive palm oil is the cheapest oil okay so i'm not supposed to give this person safflower oil my genetic test said to give this person pufa which is safflower so i happily prescribed a safflower so now suddenly if i've done the microbiome i'm going in and saying uh your genetic report said you could have coconut oil so i'm going to go with coconut oil and i'm not going to give you olive oil because your olive oil in your genetic report said that mufa is bad for you so i i would kind of look at the balance in terms of do i want to first get the gutten alignment so maybe i'll give the olive oil or no no ryan don't give the olive oil right now we could survive on coconut oil we could give we could give a sesame oil till oil and we can give so many other oils that are there right so we could give sunflower ground so i think this is really really good in terms of what i need to do and in terms of spices whoa you know don't give this guy uh black cumin seeds oh in a covert time i've told everyone take black cumin seeds very very very good because it's got antiviral properties but for this person no black cumin seeds in his kada so you got to figure out how we do all of these things so i believe that there's a lot that you can learn from here and this is the microbiome kit it comes to you at your home it's a small bottle inside you put a plastic film across your commode your pot you poop on top of that plastic film you get up take a scoop there's a scoop in the bottle that comes in you put it into the bottle which has a preservative liquid close it just a little tiny like less than like 1 8 of a teaspoon of poop i know this sounds gross shake it up tighten it put it in the envelope seal it up put up if you're in india we will send the you'll send the the microbiome thing across to my address we send it to the lab the lab takes three to four weeks to process this entire report report comes to me and say hi mr xyz let's walk through your microbiome report and then you start getting a diet so we my clinic builds you a separate diet this is the cost only of the testing of the report the diet is separate so we do a diet plan for you now what do you need to do you know me ryan fernando message me on any of one of my social media handles you could call me on 97 43 43 000 uh the cost of the test if it's global it's 400 uh we will check first with your government if biological human samples are allowed to be couriered uh and then before you register for a test so we check which country in the world you are um and if not we can guide you to the microbiome testing in your country uh and then do a diet plan with us and in india it's 20 000 rupees which you pay to the lab directly so we'll guide you on that and then once you get the report you can choose to take a one month a three month or six month or a 12 month plan with a dietitian i advise everybody to do a one year plan because in the first three months you will fail you will fail you will give all the possible excuses in the world people giving people say oh i'm very disciplined even olympic guys are not disciplined i'm telling you i am not disciplined i ate lays yesterday i'm a nutritionist and i had a pack of police it is human behavior so when you're tied up to a nutritionist you are reporting to your nutritionist 52 times in a year 52 weeks right you talk to me let's say uh once a month that time when you have the conversation you light up the neurons in your head saying that i am responsible when was the last time you were responsible you were responsible when you were in school after school and college you're not responsible for anything you are the bop you are the ma you are the queen you are the raja you're the king of your life so so where are you responsible to anybody for your health yeah i'm responsible to my wife i'm responsible to my husband i'm responsible to my children ganta you're not responsible get yourself tested and scare the pants off you or scare the poop out of you but get your microbiome corrected because you do not want to get colon cancer when you're 70 because you want to be in disneyland and you know when you're eating that smoothie or drinking that beverage or that alcohol you know the moderation because you've analyzed your microbiome you've analyzed your genetics and you know your koa you know your capacity give us a call hopefully we can change your health thank you for listening so far
