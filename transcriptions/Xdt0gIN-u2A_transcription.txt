[173.04 - 177.32] that we were responsible to help you out
[175.48 - 180.56] with your diet when you were when you
[177.32 - 182.08] were conceiving then during pregnan
[180.56 - 184.20] and then the weight loss and pregnancy
[182.08 - 185.60] so we went really really close so today
[184.20 - 188.80] I'm going to be
[185.60 - 191.16] interviewing about her life okay so are
[188.80 - 193.44] you ready for this yeah excited so let's
[191.16 - 196.52] start about your career you chose
[193.44 - 200.04] Finance okay and then suddenly because I
[196.52 - 202.44] don't see you as a banker yeah finance
[200.04 - 204.40] and and and fitness what was that moment
[202.44 - 206.00] where you went something snapped inside
[204.40 - 209.24] of you and said this is what I want to
[206.00 - 210.40] do for the rest of my life when my first
[209.24 - 212.12] student
[210.40 - 215.36] finished the class with me the only
[212.12 - 219.24] student in my class and she had this
[215.36 - 222.76] smile year to year and she was just like
[219.24 - 224.64] this was so amazing and I'm coming back
[222.76 - 226.36] so when you have a customer telling you
[224.64 - 228.12] that she enjoyed that class and she's
[226.36 - 231.56] coming back you know you've done
[228.12 - 234.64] something right and at that point I knew
[231.56 - 237.80] this was my purpose so I feel like
[234.64 - 240.80] Finance is something a lot of us can do
[237.80 - 243.60] uh being a great coach being able to
[240.80 - 246.28] help people change their lives is not
[243.60 - 247.96] something I don't know everybody can do
[246.28 - 250.76] I work with a lot of women you work with
[247.96 - 254.28] a lot of women and you're a role model
[250.76 - 257.72] for a lot of women in terms of family
[254.28 - 260.56] job career everything and keeping
[257.72 - 263.88] yourself fit yes were the childhood
[260.56 - 265.92] memories of you where you are a very fit
[263.88 - 267.68] person and then that carried on into
[265.92 - 270.20] your job and then ultimately now your
[267.68 - 272.20] career because very few people people
[270.20 - 274.32] have that motivation to continue to work
[272.20 - 276.12] out to continue to stay fit so from
[274.32 - 278.92] childhood was there a trigger or there
[276.12 - 281.40] was no trigger no no 100% I think I have
[278.92 - 286.00] to give a lot of credit to my parents
[281.40 - 289.20] but I've been active forever I'm 43
[286.00 - 291.24] today and I started my first like I
[289.20 - 295.36] would say yoga actually with my father
[291.24 - 297.76] at age six so he had to incorporate a
[295.36 - 299.04] lot of uh movement and Fitness in his
[297.76 - 301.48] life because he got diagnosed with
[299.04 - 304.12] diabetes quite quite early uh and I
[301.48 - 305.96] think because of his sudden sedentary
[304.12 - 308.08] lifestyle from being super active and a
[305.96 - 310.32] sports Personality to being Sentry being
[308.08 - 312.88] at the bank so when he started his
[310.32 - 314.40] jogging in yoga I started with him and
[312.88 - 316.84] then there was no stopping so there was
[314.40 - 319.76] a lot of sports there was lot of uh
[316.84 - 321.60] Athletics there was lot of dancing and
[319.76 - 325.12] it just continued of course I went into
[321.60 - 327.88] sedentary mode also but it all started
[325.12 - 329.64] from when I was age six and it hasn't
[327.88 - 332.32] stopped and I'm hoping it doesn't stop
[329.64 - 334.76] until my last breath okay so so sham
[332.32 - 336.00] says she's 43 I don't believe she's a
[334.76 - 339.32] day over
[336.00 - 341.60] 26 and uh you know I have to I have to
[339.32 - 344.32] say this to you when I first started
[341.60 - 348.44] working with you on your nutrition you
[344.32 - 351.08] looked and your statistics made you much
[348.44 - 352.44] older but now when I look at your diet
[351.08 - 354.76] when I look at your blood test when I
[352.44 - 356.96] look at your skin today it's actually
[354.76 - 359.64] younger than when I met you 10 years ago
[356.96 - 361.60] yeah I I think I I would agree with that
[359.64 - 363.96] my body age is actually about the last
[361.60 - 367.24] time I checked with you while doing the
[363.96 - 370.08] test I think it was 30 or 31 so that
[367.24 - 374.28] makes her 13 years younger than her
[370.08 - 378.00] birth certificate age so um there's one
[374.28 - 380.88] lucky man right who has you 13 years
[378.00 - 382.92] younger but I didn't know about this and
[380.88 - 385.52] my team did the research and they came
[382.92 - 388.92] to me it's like sir she went on the
[385.52 - 391.64] dictat of her parents to meet many
[388.92 - 394.48] suitors in arranged marriage and I was
[391.64 - 396.44] like I did not know that about shamri so
[394.48 - 399.40] is it true that my research is correct
[396.44 - 401.44] that there were about many many suitors
[399.40 - 404.80] that were there that you went through
[401.44 - 407.32] you know I think a lot of um women
[404.80 - 409.88] coming from a typical middle class
[407.32 - 412.76] family in India would relate to this
[409.88 - 414.48] story where two decades ago arranged
[412.76 - 417.60] marriages just what you're supposed to
[414.48 - 419.48] do and I was fully open to it and but I
[417.60 - 423.40] didn't know it was going to get so hard
[419.48 - 425.68] so most of the uh memory of my 20s is
[423.40 - 429.80] very Bittersweet sweet is because I had
[425.68 - 433.20] a fantastic job at HSBC and I had great
[429.80 - 435.56] company to like you know go out with and
[433.20 - 437.36] just have a good time but every time I
[435.56 - 440.24] came home it was very stressful because
[437.36 - 444.72] it was always about meeting a potential
[440.24 - 448.80] groom and yeah I met close to 50 men
[444.72 - 451.60] over I guess four 5 6 years wasn't close
[448.80 - 453.60] to the idea yeah but then it got very
[451.60 - 455.00] very toxic after some point because
[453.60 - 457.40] either you're rejecting or they're
[455.00 - 458.84] rejecting and it just doesn't stop
[457.40 - 461.20] because your parents and your family
[458.84 - 463.04] won't stop and then you are at this
[461.20 - 465.72] Junction where you're like should I
[463.04 - 468.64] actually go out looking for myself or
[465.72 - 470.48] should I just go with the floow so there
[468.64 - 472.48] were moments where you know you just
[470.48 - 475.80] break down your family is breaking down
[472.48 - 477.76] with you since you're sharing here today
[475.80 - 480.84] um I have went through the similar cycle
[477.76 - 484.48] in my 30s where my father made an Excel
[480.84 - 487.72] sheet of shadi.com and he had this like
[484.48 - 490.80] yes no and I said yes to about
[487.72 - 493.28] 19 potential arranged marriages only to
[490.80 - 494.92] get a know back so I can understand how
[493.28 - 496.92] you know it's also stressed on the
[494.92 - 500.92] parents for a lot of parents out there
[496.92 - 505.04] trying to get uh their kids finding this
[500.92 - 509.76] future soulmate but um I met a husband a
[505.04 - 512.56] gem of a guy and U how did you meet him
[509.76 - 514.32] was he shi.com bat matrimony.com no so
[512.56 - 515.56] he's not even from the same Community
[514.32 - 518.00] like I'm a mangalorean he's not
[515.56 - 519.84] mangalorean he's a Malu so after meeting
[518.00 - 522.92] so many of your mangalorean community
[519.84 - 526.08] boys and when I presented a malali to my
[522.92 - 529.04] parents they were like they were like no
[526.08 - 532.12] no no this can't be happening but my
[529.04 - 534.68] friends arranged this marriage with B
[532.12 - 536.24] you know like our marriage I think they
[534.68 - 538.56] also got fed up of seeing me go through
[536.24 - 540.08] this whole torture and I I think this is
[538.56 - 541.48] for all the friends friends out there
[540.08 - 543.72] okay and this goes to my friend
[541.48 - 545.84] specifically you did not arrange my
[543.72 - 549.08] marriage but's friends arrang for the
[545.84 - 554.40] marri all the friends cheers to you guys
[549.08 - 557.20] you found her we okay jokes apart um
[554.40 - 559.64] let's talk about the concept of fitness
[557.20 - 561.24] and your life partner I think as a
[559.64 - 564.48] nutritionist I've seen people when they
[561.24 - 567.76] come for counseling if one partner is
[564.48 - 571.36] fit it's okay but if both Partners have
[567.76 - 573.32] the same vibrational liit it just your
[571.36 - 576.28] life just cruises into the next mode so
[573.32 - 578.40] for you how important is it to find the
[576.28 - 580.68] same rhythm in a life partner in
[578.40 - 583.64] everything that that is there I think
[580.68 - 586.96] it's everything because I don't know
[583.64 - 588.64] otherwise um so here's something I mean
[586.96 - 590.72] this is obviously I love my parents and
[588.64 - 593.96] no offense but you going to choose your
[590.72 - 595.00] parents true very you're born into you
[593.96 - 596.56] don't get to choose your parents you
[595.00 - 598.48] don't get to choose your children
[596.56 - 601.08] children children yes and your siblings
[598.48 - 603.24] you're right yeah so why I'm saying that
[601.08 - 607.64] is like you know whether your parents
[603.24 - 609.64] kind of help you pursue that talent that
[607.64 - 612.52] you have in you they find it and pursue
[609.64 - 614.68] it or they don't you will love them
[612.52 - 616.20] always you may just fight with them
[614.68 - 617.56] whatever whatever but you'll always love
[616.20 - 619.12] them like you can't check out of that
[617.56 - 621.48] relationship you can't check out and and
[619.12 - 624.80] I keep telling my dad even today that I
[621.48 - 627.52] wish you had seen the sports person in
[624.80 - 629.80] me I would have bought a medal for India
[627.52 - 631.44] and I know I think I'm fully capable of
[629.80 - 634.24] that you know me
[631.44 - 636.20] also and he laughs it off he's like you
[634.24 - 637.60] can focus on your daughter getting a
[636.20 - 639.24] medal for the country I said of course
[637.60 - 640.56] I'm going to do that but what I'm trying
[639.24 - 643.16] to say is that you don't get to choose
[640.56 - 645.88] your parents but to a large extent in
[643.16 - 646.76] today's Times you do get to choose your
[645.88 - 650.84] life
[646.76 - 653.56] partner and for me my life changed only
[650.84 - 656.40] after marriage I became the best version
[653.56 - 659.16] of me because of my husband he he helped
[656.40 - 661.84] me bring that out and I think without uh
[659.16 - 664.48] um his support and everything I I
[661.84 - 667.24] wouldn't be doing what I am doing today
[664.48 - 669.32] you know finding that purpose chasing
[667.24 - 671.36] Fitness changing people's lives helping
[669.32 - 673.08] people get better so I think the right
[671.36 - 674.68] Partners everything and I'm sure that's
[673.08 - 676.96] it's for you as well because I've seen
[674.68 - 678.56] your relationship with your wife and I
[676.96 - 681.24] think you both bring out the best in
[678.56 - 683.16] each other it's um very few people know
[681.24 - 684.24] this but uh you know I may be the
[683.16 - 687.60] celebrity
[684.24 - 690.12] nutritionist but um she's the spanner
[687.60 - 692.92] she's the works is the engine she's the
[690.12 - 696.08] generator exactly um the behind the
[692.92 - 699.08] scenes that happen I think if you are to
[696.08 - 700.72] succeed in a profession yes uh there is
[699.08 - 703.16] a give and take especially when you get
[700.72 - 705.16] into this world behind the cameras and
[703.16 - 706.84] there's a lot of demand and all and I
[705.16 - 708.84] just want to add this very quickly and I
[706.84 - 712.44] I'm not this is not to like create any
[708.84 - 717.48] expectations for anyone but uh when I
[712.44 - 719.96] finish maternity VI my husband chose to
[717.48 - 722.12] uh become a full-time father
[719.96 - 724.64] uh he quit whatever he was doing the
[722.12 - 728.24] startup that he was a part of only so
[724.64 - 729.52] that I can go back to work and do what I
[728.24 - 732.88] deeply love
[729.52 - 735.56] doing I don't know of any other man who
[732.88 - 738.08] has done such a big sacrifice for their
[735.56 - 739.36] spouse I'm not saying it's it's what men
[738.08 - 741.28] should do or women should do nobody
[739.36 - 744.92] needs to do any kind of sacrifices or
[741.28 - 747.84] compromises but it it's just what
[744.92 - 750.64] genuinely and to the guys out there you
[747.84 - 751.56] have to give more I do the groceries I
[750.64 - 754.52] do the
[751.56 - 757.28] shopping uh and my wife says your money
[754.52 - 759.80] is my money and my money is my money so
[757.28 - 763.84] let's let's go with it but I tell you if
[759.80 - 768.32] you find the right woman your life is
[763.84 - 770.00] much easier so uh the Hunt is difficult
[768.32 - 772.88] but I think there's a saying that I
[770.00 - 775.00] always say know coincidence is a
[772.88 - 777.64] pseudonym that the good Lord uses when
[775.00 - 780.04] he wants to remain Incognito yeah so I
[777.64 - 782.68] think you meeting VI is a coincident me
[780.04 - 785.68] meeting my spouse is a coincident and I
[782.68 - 788.40] think how you build and work on that in
[785.68 - 790.80] that and marriage is all about I believe
[788.40 - 794.44] compromise it's all about compromise you
[790.80 - 796.24] know um and speaking of marriage and
[794.44 - 798.28] then obviously the next subset is what
[796.24 - 800.92] all our parents want did your parents
[798.28 - 803.56] Hound you for a daughter or a son almost
[800.92 - 806.28] immediately yeah like a year into the M
[803.56 - 807.28] you I I got it on the on the night on
[806.28 - 808.96] the night we got married my
[807.28 - 810.72] mother-in-law said to me okay it's time
[808.96 - 813.24] for you to have
[810.72 - 816.36] kids yeah I think especially for people
[813.24 - 818.96] like I had a in Indian terms a late
[816.36 - 821.40] marriage getting married at 30 for a
[818.96 - 822.76] woman in especially in my family because
[821.40 - 826.84] all my cousins were getting married at
[822.76 - 828.80] age 23 24 uh and having started you know
[826.84 - 830.52] finding a boy from age 22 then getting
[828.80 - 833.76] married at 30 it was considered very
[830.52 - 835.84] late so yeah they gave me a year but a
[833.76 - 839.40] lot of inspiration she got married at 30
[835.84 - 842.24] I married my wife at 34 she was 34 or we
[839.40 - 844.28] had a kid at 36 you need to train well
[842.24 - 846.64] you need to eat well if you're getting
[844.28 - 848.44] married late and having children late
[846.64 - 852.72] children speaking of
[848.44 - 855.24] children you have a bubbly daughter I
[852.72 - 857.36] love watching her videos thank there was
[855.24 - 859.76] there was one video where she says I
[857.36 - 861.12] forgot to grow taller was was that there
[859.76 - 863.04] like I forgot to grow taller I'm like
[861.12 - 865.00] why did you forget she looks at me she
[863.04 - 867.00] like because I forgot like why would you
[865.00 - 869.88] ask such a question and I can see her
[867.00 - 872.88] doing workouts with you and stuff that
[869.88 - 875.28] uh you mentioned a point that your
[872.88 - 877.60] father said make your daughter a
[875.28 - 880.44] champion you have all the right
[877.60 - 884.04] templates as a fitness person as a
[880.44 - 887.04] fitness mom as a fitness wife uh and
[884.04 - 888.92] that's part of your career yeah uh but
[887.04 - 891.16] it inves a lot people think it's very
[888.92 - 892.80] easy but it's a lot of investment like
[891.16 - 894.72] you can't Outsource your work out to
[892.80 - 897.96] somebody yeah what are the things you're
[894.72 - 899.36] doing with your daughter to ensure that
[897.96 - 902.32] she has
[899.36 - 904.88] a life that gets her ready for the
[902.32 - 908.92] future first and foremost I'm teaching
[904.88 - 910.84] her to eat right because I've had a
[908.92 - 913.60] great relationship with food in the
[910.84 - 915.80] sense my parents always ensure I ate
[913.60 - 918.24] home so so do you think it's important
[915.80 - 921.80] that parents lead by example the way
[918.24 - 924.84] they eat 100% okay I must say this like
[921.80 - 927.04] I have a sweet too and I probably eat
[924.84 - 929.20] you know something sweet more often than
[927.04 - 931.16] I should and I actually hide while I'm
[929.20 - 933.92] eating if she's around because I don't
[931.16 - 935.92] want her to see me because I've built a
[933.92 - 938.28] phenomenal routine for her with her food
[935.92 - 940.68] and a lot of which I've learned from you
[938.28 - 943.68] and I know that a few years from now
[940.68 - 946.08] when she's ready to like you know uh do
[943.68 - 948.48] a lot more the only first person I would
[946.08 - 950.64] come to is you for her nutrition and
[948.48 - 952.40] everything else but the most important
[950.64 - 955.44] thing to teach your child at a very
[952.40 - 959.32] young age is to eat right and I will say
[955.44 - 961.68] this she's 3 years old and when when I
[959.32 - 963.56] give her a cupcake which is only on the
[961.68 - 965.52] weekends and on a birthday because then
[963.56 - 968.92] she there's there's a significance like
[965.52 - 970.88] she's Associated that with a celebration
[968.92 - 973.80] she'll eat half of it and then she'll
[970.88 - 977.28] just give me the rest and she'll say I'm
[973.80 - 979.52] done and I think this relationship that
[977.28 - 982.00] she's also built with food and what she
[979.52 - 984.08] would choose to eat more is cucumbers
[982.00 - 986.36] and beetroots and carrots and you know
[984.08 - 988.52] what I mean like and this is my first
[986.36 - 990.44] Focus the decision to put her into the
[988.52 - 992.40] particular daycare that she goes to was
[990.44 - 994.92] after looking at their menu so I feel
[992.40 - 997.04] like food can be medicine food can be
[994.92 - 999.08] poison and you've taught me all of that
[997.04 - 1000.92] very well in the last decade and I want
[999.08 - 1002.72] to be able to teach my child that
[1000.92 - 1005.44] movement comes to her naturally because
[1002.72 - 1007.68] she sees her mom and do Mom and Dad jump
[1005.44 - 1010.96] around all the time lift weights so she
[1007.68 - 1012.44] does it on her own movement eating right
[1010.96 - 1015.84] kindness these are the few things that
[1012.44 - 1018.00] I'm trying my best to teach her so
[1015.84 - 1019.44] family is crucial to use what I can see
[1018.00 - 1022.24] your daughter is the center of your
[1019.44 - 1025.84] Universe what's your normal day like
[1022.24 - 1027.76] starts at about 5: 4:45 5 in the morning
[1025.84 - 1029.96] uh you always got up at 5:00 in the
[1027.76 - 1031.84] morning no it's only post my daughter
[1029.96 - 1034.64] otherwise I was a I would wake up early
[1031.84 - 1039.16] for a class not for my own workout to
[1034.64 - 1040.96] teach others but now post a baby I
[1039.16 - 1044.00] realize like the only other time I have
[1040.96 - 1045.52] is morning so first thing out of my way
[1044.00 - 1047.52] is my own workout because there's
[1045.52 - 1048.96] literally no other time that you'll find
[1047.52 - 1050.52] because once you're a
[1048.96 - 1054.84] so are you saying that this is key to
[1050.52 - 1058.72] all the women out there which is we need
[1054.84 - 1061.28] to focus on ourselves first 100% with
[1058.72 - 1063.96] how do you take care of a family if you
[1061.28 - 1065.40] are not able to take care of yourself
[1063.96 - 1068.00] how are you going to be strong enough
[1065.40 - 1069.96] mentally physically emotionally you know
[1068.00 - 1072.12] for your family you need to be strong
[1069.96 - 1075.72] first and only then like and you know I
[1072.12 - 1078.48] hear because I do so many female clients
[1075.72 - 1081.40] that they say that oh but I my husband
[1078.48 - 1084.12] oh but my children oh but my job always
[1081.40 - 1085.92] oh there's always an oh which is why you
[1084.12 - 1088.32] have to wake up at 4:45 if you have to
[1085.92 - 1090.04] get it done so you're awake at 4:45 you
[1088.32 - 1092.20] work out then what happens and then I
[1090.04 - 1094.04] come back home uh I have a very
[1092.20 - 1096.60] supportive husband who's already gotten
[1094.04 - 1098.84] you know the little one ready uh so I go
[1096.60 - 1101.32] and do my little bit sometimes I'm not
[1098.84 - 1103.88] even there I I miss that time and he's
[1101.32 - 1105.72] already taken her off to school uh and
[1103.88 - 1108.12] drops it off and then it's your usual
[1105.72 - 1112.08] you know shower breakfast work work work
[1108.12 - 1113.92] work work and then I'm trying very often
[1112.08 - 1117.16] to ensure I'm there at 400 p.m. to pick
[1113.92 - 1119.24] her up so my window to work is between
[1117.16 - 1121.88] like 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. to get more
[1119.24 - 1125.00] stuff done so that 4 p.m. when I picked
[1121.88 - 1128.36] her up I spend at least couple of hours
[1125.00 - 1131.80] with her playing reading all of that you
[1128.36 - 1134.52] all cook together no I don't cook much
[1131.80 - 1137.24] does she does she like to prepare stuff
[1134.52 - 1138.96] pretend play pretend I think that's an
[1137.24 - 1141.88] important thing that
[1138.96 - 1145.16] like I do smoothies or pancakes with my
[1141.88 - 1147.88] kid and you get lesser resistant from
[1145.16 - 1149.84] the child if they have contributed to a
[1147.88 - 1153.52] preparation of something especially
[1149.84 - 1156.00] novel foods and a quick tip children
[1153.52 - 1158.40] will refuse a food for up to 11 to 12
[1156.00 - 1162.48] exposures before their pette begins to
[1158.40 - 1165.68] accept it right so mothers shamri don't
[1162.48 - 1167.56] give up till you have had 12 or 13
[1165.68 - 1170.68] attempts of exposure with something off
[1167.56 - 1172.88] of food I think a great uh takeaway
[1170.68 - 1175.52] you've launched many gyms and you're
[1172.88 - 1178.56] part of cfit as a fitness expert you're
[1175.52 - 1181.28] a dance instructor um you've coordinated
[1178.56 - 1183.32] show so many shows and everything how do
[1181.28 - 1185.92] you convince people how do you convince
[1183.32 - 1188.24] women that muscle is important I always
[1185.92 - 1190.96] say muscle is an age reversible organ
[1188.24 - 1193.80] yeah but obviously you meet them in your
[1190.96 - 1196.00] class you do dance but you encourage
[1193.80 - 1198.88] them to do resistance training so what's
[1196.00 - 1200.84] your take on on muscle for women
[1198.88 - 1202.00] I say the same thing that you say by the
[1200.84 - 1204.12] way that muscle is the only age
[1202.00 - 1207.24] reversible organ in the body and I think
[1204.12 - 1211.80] more than anything else um we want to
[1207.24 - 1214.96] age gracefully right aging gracefully is
[1211.80 - 1216.76] is denied to most people like I look at
[1214.96 - 1219.68] my own parents today and I'm like
[1216.76 - 1221.84] they're they're 70 they've been fairly
[1219.68 - 1227.08] active all their life Etc but they don't
[1221.84 - 1229.04] have the strength so being active and
[1227.08 - 1231.48] you know not not having the strength
[1229.04 - 1235.64] when you're at 70 doesn't match doesn't
[1231.48 - 1237.12] make sense but if you build enough
[1235.64 - 1238.92] strength by doing the right amount of
[1237.12 - 1241.84] resistance training weight training at
[1238.92 - 1243.44] least two to three times a week you are
[1241.84 - 1245.08] going to be able to age gracefully I
[1243.44 - 1246.88] mean you need the muscle mass you need
[1245.08 - 1250.44] your joints to function better you need
[1246.88 - 1254.32] a strong posterior chain to be able to
[1250.44 - 1255.64] walk without losing balance at 70 75 80
[1254.32 - 1257.56] right but you know we keep saying this
[1255.64 - 1259.56] to our parents you need to weit train
[1257.56 - 1262.00] and stuff like that and I think nobody
[1259.56 - 1264.20] told that to them in their 20s 30s and
[1262.00 - 1267.04] 40s so they cannot develop a new skill
[1264.20 - 1269.52] set in their 50s and 60s I agree but
[1267.04 - 1271.52] even at 50s and 60s to start doing some
[1269.52 - 1275.20] unilateral training and V training it's
[1271.52 - 1276.56] not too late amazing impact yes in fact
[1275.20 - 1279.52] I would like to share with people there
[1276.56 - 1281.68] was this uh scientific research done
[1279.52 - 1283.72] which was these old age people they put
[1281.68 - 1285.76] them in a home yeah and in one part of
[1283.72 - 1288.40] the home they gave them board games and
[1285.76 - 1290.76] in another part of the uh old age they
[1288.40 - 1293.36] gave them a gym resistant training
[1290.76 - 1294.80] chiefly leg extension 6 months later
[1293.36 - 1296.76] they did the biopsy of the two groups
[1294.80 - 1299.12] the board game group and the knee
[1296.76 - 1301.04] extension group who did exercise and
[1299.12 - 1303.68] they found that muscle regressed by 6
[1301.04 - 1307.20] years at the age of 72 so I think it's
[1303.68 - 1310.20] very key to understand that um we have
[1307.20 - 1313.12] to encourage women to work out and
[1310.20 - 1316.32] you're a living proof example of it whil
[1313.12 - 1318.64] you publicly told us your age is 43 yes
[1316.32 - 1322.08] but her metabolic age is
[1318.64 - 1323.92] one so she's far a decade younger and I
[1322.08 - 1326.00] meet so many women in the clinic and
[1323.92 - 1329.20] that's why I was so inspired to have
[1326.00 - 1333.12] scham is my first female guest on board
[1329.20 - 1335.48] because the paradigm shift is that women
[1333.12 - 1337.92] need to take care of their bodies yes
[1335.48 - 1341.36] they cannot have an excuse of husband
[1337.92 - 1343.52] children career yeah and our hormones
[1341.36 - 1345.44] you you yeah we have only one hormone
[1343.52 - 1348.28] testosterone you have multiple hormones
[1345.44 - 1350.84] exactly if you want to like really keep
[1348.28 - 1352.16] that balance with the hormones and Etc
[1350.84 - 1354.08] there's nothing better than weight
[1352.16 - 1355.80] training nothing better than weight
[1354.08 - 1357.48] training and also training according to
[1355.80 - 1359.92] your cycle so on and so forth there's
[1357.48 - 1363.32] like there's we can go into depth of
[1359.92 - 1365.76] that later but every woman must pick up
[1363.32 - 1369.56] weights and it doesn't have to be heavy
[1365.76 - 1371.48] light or heavy the choice is ours we
[1369.56 - 1373.04] figure over a period of Time how
[1371.48 - 1376.16] important is it to have a personal
[1373.04 - 1377.60] trainer well it depends on a goal I
[1376.16 - 1380.60] think having a personal trainer is
[1377.60 - 1382.56] phenomen nomenal it can really change
[1380.60 - 1384.08] the way you train because you would have
[1382.56 - 1386.68] seen a version of yourself which you
[1384.08 - 1388.40] wouldn't otherwise see in a group class
[1386.68 - 1389.60] because here the focus is just you right
[1388.40 - 1391.76] the trainer is trying to get the best
[1389.60 - 1394.04] out of you so I think everyone can
[1391.76 - 1396.28] experience getting a personal trainer to
[1394.04 - 1397.84] really identify what they're capable of
[1396.28 - 1400.04] and to have all the you know the right
[1397.84 - 1402.44] correction guidance postural changes and
[1400.04 - 1405.08] Etc but since personal training is
[1402.44 - 1407.32] expensive I would say even if you do you
[1405.08 - 1409.24] know group classes but if you weight
[1407.32 - 1412.12] train
[1409.24 - 1414.20] how often do you weit train every day
[1412.12 - 1416.80] you weit train every day is Sunday a
[1414.20 - 1419.28] rest day Sunday is yeah rest I try to do
[1416.80 - 1421.56] some Mobility on Sunday at home with my
[1419.28 - 1425.00] daughter uh she's just I mean I do it
[1421.56 - 1426.88] she just jumps jumps in but um Saturday
[1425.00 - 1428.68] mostly would be a long run because I
[1426.88 - 1432.52] enjoy running and I feel like the human
[1428.68 - 1436.00] body is naturally designed to run so we
[1432.52 - 1438.20] can't kind of lose that you know ability
[1436.00 - 1439.96] and mobility and everything so weight
[1438.20 - 1442.80] training is something that's that's it
[1439.96 - 1445.08] should be non-negotiable for all women
[1442.80 - 1448.12] uh not just from a strength point of
[1445.08 - 1452.40] view because personally for me it's made
[1448.12 - 1454.96] me a very confident person nothing no
[1452.40 - 1456.44] education no you know different types of
[1454.96 - 1459.08] jobs has been able to give me the
[1456.44 - 1461.36] confidence that weight training has
[1459.08 - 1464.32] given me so yeah it just boosts your
[1461.36 - 1466.60] confidence five workouts that you would
[1464.32 - 1468.88] give any woman out there watching five
[1466.60 - 1471.64] workouts like she does doesn't have time
[1468.88 - 1473.36] she has 20 minutes in the day yeah five
[1471.64 - 1475.24] exercises that she could do maybe five
[1473.36 - 1478.16] workouts is the wrong thing yeah excise
[1475.24 - 1480.88] five exercises plank it's what your core
[1478.16 - 1482.88] and your spine really needs so it's
[1480.88 - 1488.96] mandatory and how much should a person
[1482.88 - 1490.68] hold a plank honestly even 45 seconds 60
[1488.96 - 1492.68] seconds is more than enough I mean we
[1490.68 - 1495.24] don't want anyone to hold for 10 minutes
[1492.68 - 1498.44] and 5 minutes it's not a challenge right
[1495.24 - 1500.88] you do a 30 to 45 seconds plan Plank and
[1498.44 - 1504.00] repeat like 3 to five and what should be
[1500.88 - 1506.12] the rest in between 15 seconds 15
[1504.00 - 1509.56] seconds yeah okay more than enough 15
[1506.12 - 1511.52] that's one what squats foundational
[1509.56 - 1514.72] movement especially if you can learn to
[1511.52 - 1516.40] deep squat if you practice about 10
[1514.72 - 1519.00] minutes of deep Squat and you can
[1516.40 - 1521.00] accumulate there's there's one Instagram
[1519.00 - 1523.08] video of you talking about this even
[1521.00 - 1524.84] from a constipation point of view bow
[1523.08 - 1527.80] movement point of view and everything
[1524.84 - 1529.92] yes it's what we if you notice a toddler
[1527.80 - 1532.32] an infant to a toddler when they move
[1529.92 - 1533.68] squatting deep squatting is the first
[1532.32 - 1534.96] movement you know I want to share
[1533.68 - 1537.60] something with you and share with all
[1534.96 - 1539.84] the women out there I recently went for
[1537.60 - 1542.00] a wellness Retreat and there were
[1539.84 - 1543.76] phenomenal number of women over there
[1542.00 - 1546.44] and we were doing a yoga class where we
[1543.76 - 1549.04] had to go into a squat Po and I can tell
[1546.44 - 1551.52] you without a doubt about 80% of the
[1549.04 - 1553.48] women were not squatting properly they
[1551.52 - 1554.96] were on their toes or they were half
[1553.48 - 1556.88] squatted but they couldn't get into a
[1554.96 - 1558.44] deep squat so I think this is something
[1556.88 - 1560.80] that's crucial
[1558.44 - 1563.88] that women if you can't squat well and
[1560.80 - 1567.32] hold that position and then get up we
[1563.88 - 1570.20] need to really work on this with your
[1567.32 - 1572.68] trainer yes with you practicing it on a
[1570.20 - 1577.44] daily basis what's the third exercise
[1572.68 - 1579.68] okay squat plank lunges because lunges
[1577.44 - 1581.36] allows you to focus on balance and
[1579.68 - 1583.36] stability which is what you need as you
[1581.36 - 1585.84] age because as we age we lose balance
[1583.36 - 1588.36] and stability because it's a single leg
[1585.84 - 1590.00] movement it allows you to focus on
[1588.36 - 1592.20] balance and stability and excellent for
[1590.00 - 1593.84] your glue for your butt butt being the
[1592.20 - 1597.12] largest muscle and we know how we need
[1593.84 - 1598.88] to keep it really strong uh also recent
[1597.12 - 1600.52] some studies show about how your
[1598.88 - 1602.80] posterior training especially your
[1600.52 - 1604.64] glutes and your hips can help in
[1602.80 - 1607.84] longevity because you're going to avoid
[1604.64 - 1610.44] more Falls and stuff like that so lunges
[1607.84 - 1612.92] right uh something that can take the
[1610.44 - 1615.76] heart rate up and can give you a you
[1612.92 - 1618.92] know a great quick cardio activity
[1615.76 - 1621.04] burpees it's my favorite Yona does my
[1618.92 - 1622.52] little one does burpees like with the
[1621.04 - 1625.72] finest technique and she learned it on
[1622.52 - 1627.92] her own but burpees is phenomenal for a
[1625.72 - 1630.52] quick burst of cardio you know you
[1627.92 - 1633.56] suddenly hit like zone three zone four
[1630.52 - 1635.64] come back so it's phenomenal the last
[1633.56 - 1637.92] exercise I don't know if this is an
[1635.64 - 1640.24] exercise but I feel every human being
[1637.92 - 1643.04] must walk more I was about to add this
[1640.24 - 1645.20] as my sixth one came in so yes we've got
[1643.04 - 1646.52] walking tell us about walking and why oh
[1645.20 - 1648.12] my God I
[1646.52 - 1651.40] mean
[1648.12 - 1653.04] it's just what we're supposed to do I
[1651.40 - 1654.40] know we could have done this podcast
[1653.04 - 1656.44] also walking but then there'll be too
[1654.40 - 1657.80] much distraction but walking is just
[1656.44 - 1661.20] something you're supposed to do and
[1657.80 - 1662.88] walking is best for fat loss I mean so
[1661.20 - 1665.04] many people struggling out there to Fat
[1662.88 - 1666.84] Loss you eat right you walk a lot you'll
[1665.04 - 1669.52] see that fat kind of melting away right
[1666.84 - 1671.96] it's one of your best zone two training
[1669.52 - 1673.80] and we all need to do zone two training
[1671.96 - 1675.72] almost every day so it's the finest Zone
[1673.80 - 1677.60] to training it's what the body is
[1675.72 - 1680.52] designed to do like we say sitting is is
[1677.60 - 1682.52] the new smoking yeah awesome and I
[1680.52 - 1684.88] always tell people that when I worked
[1682.52 - 1686.64] with the film stars one prescription to
[1684.88 - 1690.08] all of them is please walk and they look
[1686.64 - 1692.28] at me very quizzically but to fat burn
[1690.08 - 1695.84] when you are walking your heart rate is
[1692.28 - 1698.96] in that targeted Zone where the
[1695.84 - 1701.32] substrate utilization meaning the source
[1698.96 - 1703.40] of fuel inside your body is not glycogen
[1701.32 - 1706.12] from the muscle which is the carb but
[1703.40 - 1709.68] actually fat the higher you go in your
[1706.12 - 1712.28] heart rate the more is glycogen as a
[1709.68 - 1714.68] fuel or a Battery Source the lower the
[1712.28 - 1716.04] intensity the more the fat you burn
[1714.68 - 1719.60] which is why we have something known as
[1716.04 - 1722.20] neat non exercise adaptive thermogenesis
[1719.60 - 1724.40] which is sh what your mother and what my
[1722.20 - 1726.24] mother and our grandparents did which is
[1724.40 - 1728.76] being fidgety around the house and
[1726.24 - 1730.04] cleaning and cooking and jaru and POA
[1728.76 - 1731.88] which is why a lot of you in the
[1730.04 - 1733.64] pandemic lost weight because the
[1731.88 - 1735.04] housekeeping didn't turn up so you were
[1733.64 - 1738.08] fidgeting you were constantly on the
[1735.04 - 1740.44] Move now speaking of constantly on the
[1738.08 - 1744.00] move you are one of the fittest moms in
[1740.44 - 1746.24] the country per se it's it's is the
[1744.00 - 1750.36] fittest mom she's got a Ryan fando
[1746.24 - 1754.64] Chapan approval on that any any three
[1750.36 - 1757.24] advices that you would give uh to moms
[1754.64 - 1759.48] about the nutrition that you do I know
[1757.24 - 1761.16] I'm the nutritionist but what would you
[1759.48 - 1763.20] tell people to do from a nutrition point
[1761.16 - 1767.56] of view after working with me for almost
[1763.20 - 1770.00] a decade eat more protein because Mom
[1767.56 - 1772.00] especially oh my God during that whole
[1770.00 - 1773.56] breastfeeding phase and Etc it's so
[1772.00 - 1775.84] important and then when you want to lose
[1773.56 - 1778.68] weight after that it's so important eat
[1775.84 - 1780.72] more protein uh so it's only nutrition
[1778.68 - 1783.80] advice you want to know give us exercise
[1780.72 - 1785.68] also yeah walk more walk walk walk
[1783.80 - 1788.40] remember when when you delivered y I
[1785.68 - 1791.40] said just walk walk walk you told me
[1788.40 - 1793.72] 15,000 steps yeah like I'm I'm a dance
[1791.40 - 1795.96] instructor I'm a fitness instructor I'm
[1793.72 - 1798.28] like you're going to walk cuz walk is so
[1795.96 - 1801.24] important for that post pregnancy weight
[1798.28 - 1803.72] loss and especially for women who do not
[1801.24 - 1806.16] have a natural delivery then trying to
[1803.72 - 1808.56] get into hardcore workouts that scham
[1806.16 - 1810.44] started almost instantaneously walking
[1808.56 - 1812.48] is better for the first month a month
[1810.44 - 1816.12] and a half till your body re
[1812.48 - 1819.20] acclimatizes back in yes yes do your do
[1816.12 - 1820.56] your blood tests more often if needed
[1819.20 - 1822.76] because I think your hormones are all
[1820.56 - 1824.72] over the place because mentally you're
[1822.76 - 1826.48] disturbed emotionally you're disturbed
[1824.72 - 1829.76] physically there's been a tornado in the
[1826.48 - 1831.64] body so I think I did it every 3 or 4
[1829.76 - 1833.96] months at that phase at one year
[1831.64 - 1836.44] postpartum so the blood test really
[1833.96 - 1839.04] helped me ensure that I'm not getting
[1836.44 - 1840.72] deficient anywhere and I'm constantly
[1839.04 - 1843.68] you know fueling it or
[1840.72 - 1846.44] refueling and last but not least uh
[1843.68 - 1848.20] Community I feel like the community
[1846.44 - 1852.12] angle which most people don't talk about
[1848.20 - 1855.64] is so critical if you if you have ever
[1852.12 - 1857.40] attended a shamri Glo class you will
[1855.64 - 1859.92] understand the meaning of community to
[1857.40 - 1862.96] the next level I came out of a class
[1859.92 - 1867.60] once vibrating because there was so much
[1862.96 - 1870.32] of banter exchange motivation go you go
[1867.60 - 1872.08] girl you go you can do it and stuff like
[1870.32 - 1874.76] that I I remember that yeah I think
[1872.08 - 1875.96] Community like this is a show that I
[1874.76 - 1878.64] feel everyone should watch I think it's
[1875.96 - 1880.40] on Netflix it's called LIF to 100 and it
[1878.64 - 1882.80] talks about all the blue zones where we
[1880.40 - 1885.52] have centenarians and they spoke about
[1882.80 - 1888.00] how you know movement and food and the
[1885.52 - 1890.00] third thing being community contributes
[1888.00 - 1892.16] to longevity relationships yeah
[1890.00 - 1894.80] relationships exactly what are the top
[1892.16 - 1896.76] foods that if you met your friends you
[1894.80 - 1898.68] were eating with them having this
[1896.76 - 1900.40] relationship with them what would you
[1898.68 - 1902.80] eat and you're not speaking to your
[1900.40 - 1906.76] nutritionist now you're speaking to a
[1902.80 - 1909.12] talk show host and uh tell us oh my God
[1906.76 - 1912.08] okay uh I know you love your glass of
[1909.12 - 1915.76] wine yeah I do I like my wine sometimes
[1912.08 - 1918.08] I like my beer so uh I don't I don't
[1915.76 - 1922.48] overdo it but I don't like compromise on
[1918.08 - 1924.84] it either uh I do the Sweet Tooth yeah
[1922.48 - 1926.88] the Sweet Tooth comes in the end and
[1924.84 - 1928.64] that also I don't I com I don't
[1926.88 - 1931.24] compromise I mean you know sometimes I'm
[1928.64 - 1934.36] like you work so hard you work out
[1931.24 - 1936.84] harder the you should be able to enjoy a
[1934.36 - 1940.44] few things in life and then you know I I
[1936.84 - 1943.00] love fries but I really
[1940.44 - 1945.64] control but I do enjoy a little bit I
[1943.00 - 1947.44] also love fries yeah yeah but if there
[1945.64 - 1950.40] is like a big bowl of fries I probably
[1947.44 - 1953.40] would count and not have more than like
[1950.40 - 1955.40] 10 fries you know what I mean so I think
[1953.40 - 1957.72] sham is more disciplined than me when it
[1955.40 - 1959.00] comes to french fries oh my God so happy
[1957.72 - 1961.32] to hear
[1959.00 - 1964.08] that but yeah it's it's tough when
[1961.32 - 1966.40] you're out you have a kid I have a kid
[1964.08 - 1969.64] our kids are these days normally
[1966.40 - 1972.48] engrossed in their devices how important
[1969.64 - 1974.56] is it for our children to be physically
[1972.48 - 1977.36] active when should they be physically
[1974.56 - 1978.88] active and how can parents and encourage
[1977.36 - 1979.92] their children to form a routine and go
[1978.88 - 1982.52] in that
[1979.92 - 1984.24] direction yeah I think I can say a lot
[1982.52 - 1987.64] now because I have a child and I watch
[1984.24 - 1990.32] her I think being Physically Active is
[1987.64 - 1992.56] everything for children everything they
[1990.32 - 1994.68] they should just be active all times and
[1992.56 - 1997.92] I would just tell all the you know
[1994.68 - 2001.40] listeners who have children that it's
[1997.92 - 2004.88] not about Fitness don't worry about your
[2001.40 - 2007.56] child's Fitness just ensure that your
[2004.88 - 2008.76] child is playing a sport
[2007.56 - 2010.88] most
[2008.76 - 2013.08] important either they are just running
[2010.88 - 2015.40] around you know in in the apartment
[2013.08 - 2018.84] building or in the Park or wherever they
[2015.40 - 2020.76] are or you have to identify one sport
[2018.84 - 2022.52] that they kind of enjoy doing they don't
[2020.76 - 2024.40] need to love it they may just change
[2022.52 - 2027.92] every two years what they love but I
[2024.40 - 2030.84] feel every child in this country maybe
[2027.92 - 2033.08] in this world should play a sport a
[2030.84 - 2035.36] sport that they kind of like for as long
[2033.08 - 2037.40] as they want to it's a movement and like
[2035.36 - 2040.48] I mean I definitely want to start my
[2037.40 - 2042.88] child at age 4 uh Age 4 is a good time
[2040.48 - 2047.00] to start certain types of activities
[2042.88 - 2048.92] like ballet will be age4 age5 gymnastics
[2047.00 - 2052.16] you can start from age four and I feel
[2048.92 - 2054.60] it's a great Foundation to have for most
[2052.16 - 2056.04] children gymnastics and then after that
[2054.60 - 2058.88] they can pick up a sport that they like
[2056.04 - 2061.88] I mean there's so many options today so
[2058.88 - 2064.84] many ways to you know be active build a
[2061.88 - 2066.00] routine right one is identify what sport
[2064.84 - 2069.16] and what are the different things they
[2066.00 - 2071.00] want to do second is build a routine you
[2069.16 - 2072.56] they come back from school like okay
[2071.00 - 2073.96] I'll tell you what my routine is right
[2072.56 - 2075.76] of course the kids have no time in the
[2073.96 - 2078.32] morning they wake up and go to you know
[2075.76 - 2080.36] daycare School wherever my child comes
[2078.32 - 2082.28] back she has a little snack and then
[2080.36 - 2084.00] soon after that for the next 1 hour it's
[2082.28 - 2085.76] play time and it could be anything it
[2084.00 - 2087.72] could be cycling it could be just
[2085.76 - 2090.56] running around going to the park sliding
[2087.72 - 2092.60] down up in whatever it is players
[2090.56 - 2095.08] players sport do an activity which is
[2092.60 - 2096.64] physical in nature for an hour or so
[2095.08 - 2097.44] right if they want to do more great do
[2096.64 - 2101.00] more
[2097.44 - 2103.52] and then you can then I do some reading
[2101.00 - 2105.72] like for about 30 minutes 40 minutes max
[2103.52 - 2108.52] we do some reading and then we do dinner
[2105.72 - 2111.48] and we go to bed and the routine is such
[2108.52 - 2113.48] where screen time is only given on
[2111.48 - 2116.04] Saturday and Sunday and this is
[2113.48 - 2118.24] something we built we built from the
[2116.04 - 2120.32] beginning so there is no screen time on
[2118.24 - 2122.96] other days at all unless of course we've
[2120.32 - 2124.72] gone out for dinner on a weekday and
[2122.96 - 2126.64] then the child is getting supremely
[2124.72 - 2127.92] bored in an adult conversation then you
[2126.64 - 2131.44] don't don't have a choice you have to
[2127.92 - 2134.84] engage them in some other way so yeah
[2131.44 - 2137.40] it's snack physical play some mental
[2134.84 - 2140.84] thing with reading drawing doing some
[2137.40 - 2143.76] puzzles dinner and bedtime reading and
[2140.84 - 2145.96] sleep Saturday Sunday about 2 hours of
[2143.76 - 2148.80] scream time and a lot of play through
[2145.96 - 2150.52] the day so I feel just you have to be
[2148.80 - 2152.48] active for that too so you have to be
[2150.52 - 2154.04] strong and you know you should have the
[2152.48 - 2155.60] ability to run around with a child
[2154.04 - 2156.84] because sometimes you live in spaces
[2155.60 - 2158.96] where you don't have too many kids to
[2156.84 - 2160.96] play around with uh but there are so
[2158.96 - 2163.92] many activities for kids today it's
[2160.96 - 2166.20] phenomenal like I took my child uh bould
[2163.92 - 2168.04] ring you know the rock climbing it's
[2166.20 - 2170.40] mostly for adults but then they had a
[2168.04 - 2172.48] small section where you can just learn
[2170.40 - 2174.68] and she loved it and then I took her and
[2172.48 - 2176.84] her friends so you have to experiment
[2174.68 - 2179.00] what's out there sports awesome so
[2176.84 - 2181.48] you're talking about children getting
[2179.00 - 2184.00] more physically active yes what about if
[2181.48 - 2185.72] somebody their parents like my parents
[2184.00 - 2187.68] wanted me to only study and not have any
[2185.72 - 2189.28] physical activity who never worked out
[2187.68 - 2192.04] so a lot of our listeners have never
[2189.28 - 2194.72] worked out so somebody who's never done
[2192.04 - 2197.44] a workout what would your advice be okay
[2194.72 - 2199.48] I'll say something and uh how to start
[2197.44 - 2202.40] yeah start with an activity your child
[2199.48 - 2204.80] thoroughly enjoys doing that's the most
[2202.40 - 2206.40] important identify put them into two
[2204.80 - 2208.28] three different activities and see what
[2206.40 - 2210.76] they like and let's build on that don't
[2208.28 - 2213.36] force the child to do what you want them
[2210.76 - 2214.76] to do identify what they like because
[2213.36 - 2217.12] they'll probably like five different
[2214.76 - 2219.36] things right but one you can stick and
[2217.12 - 2221.96] with the adults you know what this is
[2219.36 - 2224.08] something I read recently Ryan that you
[2221.96 - 2228.08] may not have come from a very healthy
[2224.08 - 2231.00] family and you know you don't have uh a
[2228.08 - 2233.40] healthy way of living but at least let
[2231.00 - 2235.76] the person that's come out of you learn
[2233.40 - 2237.08] how to be healthy change the Next
[2235.76 - 2240.16] Generation yes change the Next
[2237.08 - 2242.52] Generation so a little bit for you you
[2240.16 - 2244.88] as a parent is your child is watching
[2242.52 - 2246.92] you all the time and learning from you
[2244.88 - 2248.56] so even if you're a little active it
[2246.92 - 2250.08] will make a world of a different whether
[2248.56 - 2252.48] you're active with the child playing
[2250.08 - 2254.04] with them or at least being around them
[2252.48 - 2256.68] when they're doing you know some
[2254.04 - 2259.24] activity can help trous I have a joke to
[2256.68 - 2261.96] share with everyone including you so my
[2259.24 - 2263.96] son does karate he's 10 years old and
[2261.96 - 2266.68] I've gone back to karate after many
[2263.96 - 2268.68] years yeah and the first belt is yellow
[2266.68 - 2271.24] belt now I've been at yellow belt for
[2268.68 - 2272.80] one year okay because I'm doing I'm
[2271.24 - 2275.24] doing and my sense I says you need to
[2272.80 - 2277.68] change it my cheeky son comes up to me
[2275.24 - 2280.32] and says Papa you've been having yellow
[2277.68 - 2283.64] belt for the full year now I am getting
[2280.32 - 2286.76] inspired by my kid because he's watching
[2283.64 - 2288.44] me yes trying to get fit but also
[2286.76 - 2292.12] proding and poking so I think it's a
[2288.44 - 2294.00] two-way street if you as an adult start
[2292.12 - 2296.52] some physical activity your child is
[2294.00 - 2299.68] looking at you and your child is also
[2296.52 - 2301.40] then motivating you or kind of poking
[2299.68 - 2303.60] you that you know you need to get on to
[2301.40 - 2305.72] the next belt of Life absolutely my
[2303.60 - 2308.04] child is saying she wants to do uh
[2305.72 - 2310.00] skateboarding she's seen it on TV or
[2308.04 - 2314.04] somewhere do you know that skateboarding
[2310.00 - 2316.24] is an Olympic sport yes it is so I will
[2314.04 - 2317.84] I will do her ntion plan for the
[2316.24 - 2318.68] Olympics maybe I'll get a gold medal
[2317.84 - 2321.64] with
[2318.68 - 2323.52] L okay that's a promise okay not with
[2321.64 - 2327.04] skateboarding but with something gold
[2323.52 - 2330.56] medal speaking of hard work has there
[2327.04 - 2333.96] been one client's life one story that
[2330.56 - 2336.16] you can share with people that was truly
[2333.96 - 2337.48] inspirational or motivation to you or
[2336.16 - 2339.76] the world
[2337.48 - 2342.04] you know uh okay so there are a lot of
[2339.76 - 2343.96] stories that I can talk about but most
[2342.04 - 2348.16] of which revolve
[2343.96 - 2349.68] around uh fat loss weight loss you know
[2348.16 - 2352.00] and you and I both know that's a
[2349.68 - 2354.64] combination of many things but what I
[2352.00 - 2358.08] actually want to talk about is Lifestyle
[2354.64 - 2361.92] Changes right I feel that's really hard
[2358.08 - 2364.48] I have clients who don't really need
[2361.92 - 2367.12] weight loss but these are people who I
[2364.48 - 2369.64] work with and what I see that they need
[2367.12 - 2372.08] is movement in their life right like
[2369.64 - 2374.36] some sort of exercise some movement and
[2372.08 - 2376.16] these are also like especially one
[2374.36 - 2378.56] particular woman I'm talking about a
[2376.16 - 2381.32] hardcore party animal if there is some
[2378.56 - 2383.64] term like that right like their weekends
[2381.32 - 2385.40] or even week days are all about going
[2383.64 - 2386.84] out having a great time and then waking
[2385.40 - 2389.92] up next morning and working working
[2386.84 - 2391.68] working working hard farting harder you
[2389.92 - 2393.08] know changing someone like that who
[2391.68 - 2395.12] actually doesn't have a goal there is no
[2393.08 - 2396.64] weight loss goal nothing but I wanted to
[2395.12 - 2400.52] change her lifestyle and she want wanted
[2396.64 - 2403.32] it too today it's been a year actually
[2400.52 - 2405.44] she of course works out every single day
[2403.32 - 2408.56] she's been phenomenal benefits but when
[2405.44 - 2412.80] she tells me that I now go to bed at
[2408.56 - 2414.92] 10:30 versus 1:00 a.m. and 2 a.m. I now
[2412.80 - 2417.44] even look forward to working out on
[2414.92 - 2420.84] weekends and I also look forward to
[2417.44 - 2422.84] working out when I travel she's like I
[2420.84 - 2424.64] don't know this person existed she's
[2422.84 - 2427.28] looking at herself and she's saying that
[2424.64 - 2429.28] I didn't even know this was possible
[2427.28 - 2430.72] for me those kind of success story that
[2429.28 - 2433.28] that is for me a success story because
[2430.72 - 2435.20] honestly weight loss may be a longest
[2433.28 - 2438.68] one but it's possible we both know that
[2435.20 - 2440.84] it's so so changing the avar changing
[2438.68 - 2442.36] the avar of the person completely and
[2440.84 - 2444.08] there's a lot of research coming in
[2442.36 - 2447.00] behind this in terms of the brain
[2444.08 - 2449.04] neurotrophic Factor changing so from
[2447.00 - 2451.28] from that perspective when the gut
[2449.04 - 2453.72] microbiome changes that's what we need
[2451.28 - 2455.64] to focus on corre uh when you bring in
[2453.72 - 2458.40] more exercise you you deliver more
[2455.64 - 2461.24] bacteria which caus you to change your
[2458.40 - 2463.60] sense of wellbeing yes so that bacteria
[2461.24 - 2466.28] now says I want more of it like a drug
[2463.60 - 2470.48] the same goes for when we do it with
[2466.28 - 2472.52] sugar or alcohol or drugs the bacteria
[2470.48 - 2474.32] changes and releases certain molecules
[2472.52 - 2477.32] which go into your brain and form
[2474.32 - 2479.88] formative behaviors but speaking of
[2477.32 - 2482.92] behaviors there's one thing where you
[2479.88 - 2485.00] have a voluntary consumption of good or
[2482.92 - 2486.88] bad habits yeah but what if people don't
[2485.00 - 2489.88] have a choice like people who are in
[2486.88 - 2491.64] corporate India in late night shifts
[2489.88 - 2494.00] right they don't have a choice my
[2491.64 - 2496.56] brother is an example for the last two
[2494.00 - 2499.80] decades he's worked the night shift I
[2496.56 - 2501.32] can see that it's a difficult shift I
[2499.80 - 2503.88] can see that it takes a toll on the
[2501.32 - 2505.88] health so from an exercise point of view
[2503.88 - 2507.68] as a fitness expert what is the advice
[2505.88 - 2510.32] you give to a lot of people that come to
[2507.68 - 2512.44] you for workouts okay I must tell you
[2510.32 - 2516.24] this that I used to do a night shift
[2512.44 - 2518.28] Once Upon a Time right and it was
[2516.24 - 2520.24] horrible like if I had to go back I
[2518.28 - 2522.76] wouldn't do it but I've done it and I
[2520.24 - 2524.72] know but the only thing that I did and
[2522.76 - 2526.56] it was a proper night ship one thing
[2524.72 - 2528.40] that kept me going from a physical
[2526.56 - 2531.68] activity point of view during that phase
[2528.40 - 2534.12] was dance so I continued to do a lot of
[2531.68 - 2536.60] dancing and that was my way of moving
[2534.12 - 2539.88] and being fit and I did it for about 30
[2536.60 - 2541.88] 40 minutes every day so for people out
[2539.88 - 2544.24] there who you know who have you know
[2541.88 - 2546.40] difficult hours at work who struggle I
[2544.24 - 2548.68] would say it's okay if you don't go to
[2546.40 - 2550.40] the gym absolutely okay you don't get
[2548.68 - 2552.76] fit only when you go to the gym try to
[2550.40 - 2555.36] walk more often and try to pick a
[2552.76 - 2556.96] workout time that works for you it
[2555.36 - 2558.20] doesn't have to be a morning it doesn't
[2556.96 - 2560.28] have to be an evening especially if
[2558.20 - 2562.36] you're a night shift person what works
[2560.28 - 2564.20] for you is maybe waking up you know get
[2562.36 - 2566.04] some good sleep and waking up and doing
[2564.20 - 2569.96] a physical activity at home or going out
[2566.04 - 2572.96] for a jog or a walk start really slow so
[2569.96 - 2576.20] getting a workout at home do or play a
[2572.96 - 2578.20] sport absolutely anything you enjoy and
[2576.20 - 2580.44] do it at a time that works for you don't
[2578.20 - 2582.48] push yourself to do it at a time that
[2580.44 - 2584.76] someone's told you to do it that works
[2582.48 - 2587.08] the best and that's what worked for me I
[2584.76 - 2588.96] danced and I danced when I could so if
