or participants on that bankage good to always see you and I feel blessed to be invited to talk to people who uh rule the financial World let me spend half an hour with each one of you to improve your balance sheet in 2024 uh you all are Finance Wizards gurus climbing the ladder of how to use money and make money grow for yourself and when you do this you use your human intellect you use your human vibration you use your human body you use your human relationship skills and as an auditor of human health when I meet people give me about 30 seconds in a room with each one of you and I will tell you in 30 seconds looking at your eyes your pitch your tone your breath and how you breathe I will tell you whether your balance sheet is good bad or ugly so I can be called the chartered accountant um of health and and and that is the terminology that each one of you would answer so today I hope and pray that you are on this if you're on LinkedIn and you're joining us namaskara Salam alaykum wherever you are in whichever part of the world uh careful harak how is life going for you um I live in the city of Bangalore and I'm very grateful for the internet and zoom to allow me to talk to people across the world I'm also grateful that people give me their time these days in all of this interrupted marketing of Instagram short one minute videos LinkedIn half a second videos so I'm hoping to catch your attention from a personalized perspective so I'm going to share my screen I'm going to start off with sharing my screen and have my P PowerPoint I hope I'm not going to be too boring if I'm getting boring quietly sending me a message saying hey Ryan Fernando you're a little bit boring uh the first thing that you can do is you can scan this QR code and you can find me on Instagram at the end I'll give you my LinkedIn profile um what qualifies me to talk to you is one I'm educated in the field of nutrition health and medicine I am not a doctor but I'm the closest to a person not prescribing you medicine but using food as your drug using exercise as a pill and using sleep as a soothing bomb to get you to the next level let's say I want to make you an office Olympian and the people in these pictures are all superstars my latest Superstar is anupam care I'm having a ball of a time dealing with this Kashmir Superstar giant of a of a Bollywood celebrity now many of you who are coming in today may say but they celebrities you are the celebrity of your life they become celebrities because they chose very early on in their life to become celebrities I never knew I would become a celebrity nutritionist I always thought I'd be a nutritionist but the day I said I'm going to become a celebrity nutritionist a decade ago I began taking care of two things the talent or the necessary subject matter expertise like you as a financial individual have to become good at your job at your financial capabilities people skills and the second part is how do you get good in your body so people follow you so if you're a 27 year old in 360 TF or if you a vendor or if you are a partner or if you are a client who consumes this financial data when you beat people you are the celebrity in that introduction so it's very important how you breathe how you talk how you hold your energy in the communication today so the first takeaway from this slide is I want you to see your picture in this slide you are the celebrity of your life you own the balance sheet of your life if you don't own the balance sheet of your life you will not know your trp rating and your trp rating is what I'm going to Define for you today so I'm going to talk to you about how we can do some simple things okay I'm not going to give you a diet plan I cannot give you a diet plan because in my clinic qua nutrition where I practice yeah this logo up over here we do custom nutrition planning meaning I take your blood test I take your genetic test I take your microbiome which is your stool or poop analysis I do a blood test for your omega-3 then I sit down with you for 1 hour and I ask you where do you work what is your cult culture what is your background which part of the world are you from where have you relocated to who's cooking food for you what are the timings of your office and then I construct a very personalized nutrition plan so people ask me should I drink coffee I don't know till you do your genetic test so when I did my genetic test I love drinking coffee I to drink five cups of coffee a day and then I found out my body my genetics does not like coffee in fact drinking five cups of coffee will give me a heart attack or stroke which two of my grandfathers did get because they drank too much of coffee oh no but coffee I read this internet article no no no no no no do not go with Google by the way Google employees come to Ryan Fernando I want to tell you something in Bangalore Google comes to Ryan Fernando for diet planning and diet counseling for their webinars and seminars there will be a time when AI will be able to integrate this but still such time you need to holistically balance your nutrition with small tips okay so first point 20224 the people that are there in this webinar you've heard the statement health is the New Wealth I'll share a story with you I gentleman from the city of Dubai billionaire Indian he says Ryan I have 22 whatever you call it Elite Vehicles luxury Vehicles so I said sir Rolls-Royce he said I have eight Rolls-Royce when Co struck he's like you know what what's the use of the 22 super luxury Vehicles which are worth maybe about $100 million what's what's the point of having all of these vehicles if my body is not the Rollo of my life please understand I work with some of the richest people in the world about half a dozen billionaires with me they come for a nutrition plan because they want to bepoke how they should be eating scientifically then I ask them why do you want to do this they say Ryan Fernando we can't change our body we can change our house we can change our jet we can change our car we can change our company we can change our staff we can change our spouse you can't change your mother father and your sibling and your human body so there's a very nice joke in my house my wife keep saying why do you keep telling people in seminar you can change your spouse it's true you can change everything except your human body so what are you doing why are you behaving that you need a school principal in 2024 where there's enough of knowledge for you to get your backside off a couch and start putting down written resolutions like you do in your job you go to work because a boss is tracking you you go to work because you're an entrepreneur you go to work because you have a Top Line you have a bottom line and you have to perform you go to work and give the best that you can from this body because you feel that's the right thing to do what about your body what about your health is it not the New Wealth so can you tell me what have you written can you tell me what have you written down as a philosophy in 20124 pick one point my one point is I want to gain four kges of muscle this year I'm going to find it very difficult at the age of 48 to gain 4 kges of muscle because as you grow older in the male you lose testosterone if you're a female you lose test testosterone you lose estrogen so we all gaining only fat but what is it that I need to do so when I write down a quantifiable goal to my health don't say I want to live nice I want to have good body I want to have nice hair I want to lose weight do not use qualitative goals you are all Finance Executives use quantifiable goals I want to reduce BP no no no no no I want to reduce my BP by Five Points I want to reduce my blood sugar by 60 points but hang on Ryan Fernando I don't even know my sugar level ah you don't know your sugar level in 2024 how dumb can we get now artificial intelligence the new watches are even tracking BP and sweat what are we doing oh how many dollars how much transition how much Arbitrage how much all of that stuff you are all gurus on that but when it comes to the guru of your body you're putting it under the rug so I want you to First make a resolution for yourself like how I met page many years ago he made a resolution he said Ryan Fernando how can I make my body younger at 48 years of age that's my age my metabolic age is 33 so I'm now going to give you incentive to start taking care of your health I had a client Mr Vishnu Pai was 72 years of age and when he stood on my weighing scale in my clinic which measures body age visceral fat muscle percentage and health the the fat percentage his body age was 73 so he's one year older he worked with me for one year we dropped 11 kges of fat off his 100 kg frame we dropped only one kg of muscle his body age went from 72 to 60 on my wing scale 60 years of age his his birth age was since 72 in fact a year later he became 73 but now on my wi skill is 60 years of age his son sent me a big gift hamper massive gift hamper the biggest dry fruit hamper I've ever seen in my life it must have been worth some 40 50,000 Rupees like R sir thank you very much you made me very rich man it's like uh sir I don't understand no no no see papa whom you worked with Papa Mak makes consultancy fee of 2 CR rupees a year 2 CR rupees a year for those of you who are foreigners over here that's uh 2 crores is how much page help me out with this now two CR dollars is how much it'll be about a $250,000 about a quarter of a million dollars okay so so he's earning about a quarter of a million dollars a year so son is super excited because my papa now thinks he's 60 years of age do the math 12 years of consultancy feeling wonderful my health is so good it's my wealth 12 years into a quarter billion dollars I suddenly made $4 million just taking care of my health please understand ladies and gentlemen you are the real estate Vector you are the investment vehicle you are the creator of your wealth but unless your body is vibrating at the best possible frequency case in example Mr Rakesh junjala May soul rest in peace was a very rich man and I'm sure he would give half of his wealth to be alive today I feel his family and friends would give all of his wealth to have him around so there are two people here who need to influence you yourself and your family but if you have to influence your family like I told Mr Page he has to first take care of his health before he influences his spouse his children and his employees and now he's bringing it to you his consumers colleagues and fellow employees so it's not that HR or this is like oh we want you to take care of your health because it's the fashion thing to do if it is the fashionable thing to do then take off your shirt when you go for a Beach vacation to Goa but if it's not fashionable and you want to live till 75 ad walking Disney World with your grandchildren lifting weights in the gym whil half of your team can't keep Pace with you I have a 27 year old team also page average age half of them can't keep Pace with me I go five six seminars in the day they're like sir how are you able to talk for so long because it's what what you do how you sleep I got eight hours of sleep yesterday how many of you in today's seminar got eight hours of sleep I care G Hoots what everyone says you need to make money and if you do not have eight hours of sleep I will show you blood test data that cortisol is killing you silently you will die 15 years younger and if you're earning $1 million a year your family's lost $50 million but jok's apart jok's apart I want to be passionate about motivating you just to start not on a diet plan start with checkups start with small small things start with just writing I am weighing 79 kgs I should be 70 kges can I lose 1 kg per quarter not even 1 kg per month 1 kg per quarter once you start putting targeted those of you who run businesses understand the importance of Target this year I told my CEO I want to become a million dollar company how can you get me to become a million dollar company that's a Target so we are now thinking what all do we need to do to reach to that level it's not easy to get so many people doing that plan why am I sharing this with you I'm sharing this with you is quantifiable goals in anything that you do will result in some action plan what is the action plan the first action plan I told you about the roles tce this is a this is a statement I'm going to get out of the way this is a statement bankage can you do me a favor can you read this aloud for me yeah your body is the most expensive real estate you will ever own do you agree with me 100% right so even himaki is nodding ahead over there think about it now I'm going to ask you a very provocative very provocative question do you live in your body as a tenant or as a landlord do you live in your body as a tenant or a landlord answer this question truthfully to yourself and if you write landlord we have started your journey if you start as tenant I need to evict you from your body I need to throw you out I need you to make you Reby into your body as a new deal so we'll have page right down on a new agreement I promis 360 TF this year to enable my body to be bought what are the Investments I have to do drink six L of 4 lers of water I need to wear uh in a BMI of 22 okay what is the action plan for that I need to get 8 hours of sleep what is the action plan for that one action plan disconnect Netflix you know I went for Christmas holiday and I said I'm going to relax for 5 days I went onto Netflix I became a zombie because I suddenly started sleeping 4 hours because I binged watch and I don't know if I'm right or wrong but please check Netflix CEO one said you could Google this up and check if it's true or not and tell me if I'm wrong Netflix CEO 1 said we are in a battle with sleep your body is the most expensive real estate all of us live in it as chasis chasis is an Indian term which is meaning tune tenant so I'm I'm trying to convince the world the day you understand that you are the most valuable asset and you believe in self-love and you believe in taking care of yourself you'll start saying what can I do to stop being lazy and living like a tenant in my body so I'm hoping out of the 60 or 100 people that are here in this seminar today I'm just hoping that one of you decides to make the change saying that you know what I'm going to write down a few goals I'm going to start behaving like a tenant and don't worry if you fail to pay the bills in a few months but start like 365 days in the year can you get 8 hours of sleep but Ryan I did only 100 days I'll be like yeah you got 100 days of 8 hours of sleep balance 7 hours and maybe in Balance 100 days you got five to six hours my point is once you start tracking the next year oh 2024 I got 100 days of 8 hour sleep this year I'm going to get 120 days you improve your body year on year I want to share something with you uh if you if you look at this if if I have to go this way if you look at this whole list over here right can you see over here the fat cell yesi page how many years does fat cells reside in the human body eight years and can you look at maybe the uh the lung cell or the stomach cell stomach cell is the third from the top uh two to nine days right so your stomach cell is two to nine days but after all of that and all fat comes and say I'm your friend I am fat I'm going to sit in your hips and your bum and waste and everything and then it says you can't take me out of your body you can't you can't serve me an eviction notice for eight years hak is thinking oh my God if I eat another Bata in 2024 that Bata is going to stay as me as a tenant so I am trying to convince people to understand that as you gain weight in your working career you keep saying I'll do it next year I'll do it next year I'll do it in the next job I'll do it in the next business no that guy once it'ss inside of you is is for eight years I understood this fortunately because I'm in this business of the balance sheet about 20 years ago so hence I keep my weight in check which means that's why my body age is 33 because when I stand on the wing scale I have a body fat percentage of 18% and that's the age of a 33 percentage of a 33 year old but a person is 48 should have 29% body fat so once you begin to understand these constructs by the way uh what is not listed over here is muscle cells muscle cells lie with you for 14 years so if you can change your muscle cells and build muscle especially women I'm recommending my wife just gone for weight training right now so most important thing okay so we were talking about fat and eight years in the body now we need to do 10,000 thousand steps for maintenance walk and talk walk and talk walk and talk I'm actually here in the seminar and I'm dancing around most of you are sitting down so now I've got a few thousand steps yeah okay buy a walking desk take your best friend for a walk take your dog for a walk right let's let's have a meeting so page whenever you meet with your leadership team and all the stuff hey by let's go for a walk because as you begin to move you even put more blood circulation in your head now the reason we're gaining we weight the reason we're gaining weight is because we are a DJ Society DJ means desk jockey hello hello is my signal working I'm a desk jocky hello that's all that's all is the movement sit in your car drive to the supermarket go there come back to the nearest parking lot near to the to the to the shopping gate then drive to the basement of my house and go up the lift and I do this you do this all of us do it so we have to construct physical movement okay the other thing which is a secret and I'm not a very good expert but I go to a breath coach and what I've understood is we are all shallow breathers if you can breathe 5 seconds in slow breath 5 second hold and 5c out apparently this lowers your parasympathetic systems adrenal and and and anxiety and when that comes down you store lesser fat so here's a secret that I've given all my billion dollar clients after every phone call after every meeting after every webinar after every any interaction with anyone take 25 seconds out for your breath and you go like this now I'm holding and if you look at at your exercise variable your heart rate is just dropped by three point if you could do three such breaths so 25 into into 3 seconds sorry sorry my math is very bad CH 555 is 15 seconds 15 seconds I see I've made your life even more easier 15 seconds by the way there are people who can do 10c breath hold my yoga instructor is 22 seconds so 22 seconds in slow breath in slow hold for 20 seconds and out but for most people you and me arm admy just Joy let's do five in five hold five out now people like me are gurus of wisdom of nutrition and health and wellness we give you this I'll tell you where people fail people fail to practice because there is no guru at their desk telling them what to do so what can you do there are nice apps on Apple and Android which are known as breath apps download one breath app put it on your desktop and make it a point if your HR can convince you to take a breath work every day this will help you if your HR can convince you to take 10,000 steps or stand at your deck and do something please do this this is the first part of my diet plan this is the first basic stuff right and and what happens is if you do this correctly I just ate Christmas plum cake nice big piece because I know I'm going to work out I know I'm going to eat well for the rest of the day but I'm going to enjoy that plum cake guilt-free as a landlord in my body although my blood test might say much differently next month when I do it like he R your sugar's gone up but I'll keep you posted on that so nutrition now is bioindividual this concept is Ryan sir can I eat Mari biscuit can I have tea can I have coffee can I have dud can I have milk in fact the other day I was in a podcast and the guy's like sir do you take any stance on any food and I said n Sab I'm a judge I'm a judge on my right side is the defendant on my left side is the prosecutor in between is papaya my candidate stands in front of me and the candidate says sir should I eat papaya so I ask the defense attorney what do you feel papaya is very good in beta cartin it's very good in fiber it has got asanin in it it's got blah blah blah vitamin A which is high in it Lev other side prosecutor no sir this is a pregnant lady papaya could be abortive in effect you can't give papaya to the so now as judge I have to pass execution judgment on my client and I say considering all the inputs that I've got I deem papaya fit for you but for the other person no papaya for that person nutrition is very bio individual please understand you have been taught to eat out of love and culture from d ma from Mama from the people in your house my mother till today say hey you bloody Big Shot nutritionist you eat your bread you are a Goan I've written a book called wheatless I stopped eating wheat 10 years ago nobody ever told me I had adult acne till I was 35 nobody ever told me and then when I did my genetic testing that guy say gentic test testing you are doing so many people we will do yours free of cost I like okay okay please do it they did my genetic test hello Ryan Fernando Goan should not eat bread you know goans are called paas right we eat bread at breakfast lunch and dinner so look at it culturally I was thought I had a I had a jot harani who had a Cow Shed and 60 cows and I told them that the kid was lactose intolerant hey do last 20 Generations we' have been drinking milk but genetically the the science is now evolving how to eat scientifically so I'm just saying that what you could start with is a blood test a genetic test and a microbiome test these are some very fascinating pieces of advice because then when you go on vacation you're looking at everyone eating bread and then like would you like to try this s bread it's gluten low no call up the chef before I reach hello Ryan Fernando I need gluten-free bread yes sir we making glutenfree bread for you few things on nutrition that I'd like to convey to you you can add sprouts and micro greens to your charts to your poas to your snacks micro greens or Sprouts are amazing two issues nobody likes the taste nobody has the time to prepare it solution for no time to prepare for it go to your startups in Dubai or in bang wherever who are making the microgreens buy it for them get a subscription second point you know how you have to do sips systematic investment plan you want to you want to keep that money and spend it on a vacation to switch cylinder what but something inside of you says keep keep aside little money keep aside it's painful so is sometimes eating food that is healthy and by the way if you add a little bit of vinegar you little bit of chat Masala a little bit of tamaron a little bit of Masala it actually tastes good adding Basin to Roy FL reduce your grain of carbohydrate increase your protein in your rtin add Curry leaves to your DS and subis add Moringa leaves Dal Chini cinnamon I don't know if you know this actually is a fat burner there was a study saying when people ate qu teaspoon of cinnamon be careful you get mouth alers it's very heat but for those of you dalini or cinnamon that agrees with you it reduces belly fat over a 3month period so what I do is add it to tea or coffee green tea green coffee sunflower pumpkin seeds very good for brain health very good for musles and pun there are a lot of cranky people in your office all the those complaint pots as I call them every time they complain just give them a gift of pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds it helps the brain work very well they've got they've got a nutritional deficiency that's why they always complaining the body inside is telling them something and then that reflects in their personality trust me I meet people 30 minutes 30 seconds to 1 minute I can tell you how they vibrating using dates raisins berries instead of sugars for sweetness and porges and pancakes I know a lot of people don't do porridges but you know when you're too busy you'll have like a bowl of cereal or a bowl of porridge or a smoothie smoothie is another version of a porridge or pancakes pancakes is our Indian stylist Dosa or the other way is a chapati you can put in some of these dates raisins and berries because of the antioxidant powers and their sweetness is better than putting Jagger or sugar any day by the way when you buy buy dates raisins berries all of these things one thing that I've started doing 5 years ago is I buy organic food you come to my house you will see those fruit flies roaming around I don't know if you remember in your dad Ma's house they used to have that basket they used to put over all the food because all these flies and kidas used to be around today you go to anyone's house there's no fly or Kea why because you're spraying the crop day before yesterday a politician farmer came for a diet counseling he owns 50 acres of pomegranate farm so I like sir pomegranate is super super pomegranate sir the seeds of pomegranate if you eat it for one year 100 gr of pomegranate it clears up the blocks in your arteries this is a scientific paper the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want you to know about this paper 60% reduction in plaque formation 60% reduction anybody's a heart patient pomegranate pomegranate P he says sir if you know how much of fungicide we spray on the crop you will not give pomegranate to your um clients my housekeeping lady Mona sir pomegranate have you noticed organic food is not perfect spoils very quickly you'll get worms and LA in it very fast because the chemical is not sprayed so that guy is there which for me I see a l i don't go I'm like cool he's growing inside which means it's safe enough for me to eat Flip Flip in chemical organic to to organic practices this is what I wanted to convey to you and then what happens is you reduce your chemical load on your liver and kidney for the next 20 30 years of your life if there's nothing you take away from this seminar take away the fact that if you can eat organic now I know all the Indians over here what say by how do we know they're not cheating us I think we need to believe in a lot of people out there if you still don't believe do what I do I make friends with people I make friends with people so I buy Happy Hands in Bangalore I made friends with the founder mun hey manjun how you make these eggs so he told me the whole story how they do poultry farming and all he says see what we do we go and find 20 villages we tell all the villages we will help you in farming let your chickens roam free in the Farms we'll give ayura brahi this for fate this that omega3 in the feed and everything we'll give aurvedic we'll give natural blah blah blah so I know that his eggs are much better I can see it is much better I know his eggs spoil faster also because they're organic so when am I going with this make friends you are the landlord in your body you have to go and buy Salan for your house right how many of you own your own house I recently bought the house that I'm standing in right now so when I went to change one of the windows I happily went to the shop sir Italian Italian glass African glass Chinese glass or Bangalore glass next you take Chinese hey no no no I want I don't want Chinese Chinese I don't want I'm very patriotic why would I go and make a decision making when a contractor should be doing that because it's my house so what are you doing about your house where's your New Year resolution where is you taking care of you you know I have people spending 25,000 bucks on a bottle of whiskey and when they ask when I ask them to buy glacial mineral water sir 90 rupees for one bottle of water what sir so then people cheaply asking sir does really verat kohi drink 800 rupees mineral water like of course he does because he doesn't drink Johnny Walker no sorry I'm not supposed to take names and all of Brands and all but you get where I'm going right you will spend nicely on liquid engineering alcohol which is drying and destroying your liver and kidney but for Pure alkaline water glacial water ganga everyone please take a sip of water with 60% water imagine if 60% of your portfolio was in Gold where would you be today would you buy um a set class of equity or gold where gold is giving the highest return so you guys will do all of these case study analysis on financial instruments analysis first one change your water go organic brilliant this is my diet plan tips okay easy tip to follow do not eat three hours before going to bed sir I came back this pach fellow kept me in the office for so long till 10:00 at night now I reached home just now at 11:00 now I have to eat food and go to sleep don't eat food drink one glass of water say p sir J SRI Krishna and drink your water finished go to sleep the human race is eating too much of food do you agree with me think of our ancestors page your grand great grandfather and my great grandfather who lived let's say 1,000 years ago in fridge Supermarket they ate food which was grown in that 100 kilomet radius that's it if you're a bad you ate 100 kilomet radius if you're a poor man you atate 1 kilometer radius so we assume to we have taught my both my in-laws are medical doctors there was a massive argument then they were her for Christmas because they daughter doesn't eat breakfast father is an orthopedic breast I'm like your daughter has not had an asthma attack in 15 years of marriage she's married to me not a single Asma attack Have You Seen Her Health she doesn't go to the hospital see her weit she's in the best shape of the life she lifts the heaviest she's the sexiest looking that's what she says at least at 48 years of age where where's my point on this she has figured out she doesn't want to eat breakfast because she doesn't feel good I'm not saying you should or should not eat breakfast I eat breakfast I'm saying discover Your Capacity to eat don't eat because ask yourself are you feeling hungry if you skip a meal you're not going to die researcher showing fasting for 30 hours actually rejuvenates the body our ancient ancestor ditch shavan fast Pima fast this fast that fast length Ramadan everything there is there logically documented that fasting worked and you know why they did fasting because they knew humans were too weak to give up food on their own so they need a spiritual Direction I'm giving you a functional Direction there was a Nobel Prize one on autoi where the Japanese medical doctor said that at 30 to 60 hours of fasting all cancer cells and all fat cells in the body implode so when people come to me why do you think the best in the world come to me like this Ryan Fernando is a crazy fellow human race is eating too much think about it and if you want to talk about climate change you want to talk about climate change you my friends and me my friends are eating more than we actually require so the growing of that crop or the consumption of that crop and if you're a non-vegetarian the tripling or the quadling of the carbon footprint on animal produce that goes into your system where you could have survived with only 50 gram you've eaten 250 gam what full of Biryani brilliant Biryani in Bangalore one Biryani for one person I have calculated it feeds three people as D jockies huh if bankage you are a slave and you are doing manual labor in the field and all then you need the full Biryani so don't eat 3 hours before going to bed so try and get your dinner within 1 hour of sunset 637 sir I'm still in the office H order one sandwich eat in the office finished over done sir when I reach home I'm very tired I'm watching Netflix I want to eat something drink water you are not a tenant in your body you are a landlord if your stomach says by hello thums up thumbs up tenant tenant mentality we'll change it after 10 years after 10 years you go to doctor doctor says you can't change your stomach you can't change your acidity you can't change your liver you can't change your kidney you can't change your joint problems you can't change your heart attack problems you can't change your uh brain problems Alzheimer all of these are related to nutrition you know the Instagram is now blowing up we were doing this in 2010 we were telling people with structured advice what to do now you're hearing this on the Instagram and they actually finding patients on their own doing this stuff intermittent fasting not eating you know 3 hours before Sunset and stuff like that no your heart rate during workout a lot of people are dying of heart attack so what oh I'm landlord in my body a come on let's work out I'm gyms Bor I got to show off to that chick in the gym I'm 45 years of age I got to push more bench press I never went to the gym for the last 10 years go easy everyone post vaccin ation we have all had higher inflammatory markers the world has gotten more stressful more advanced so you want to run the rat race so you run on a treadmill very fast when you go to the gym my sincere advice to you is do what I do I smile in the gym and I enjoy it TR like our next rep by give me five minutes man let me enjoy it I've turned up in the gym no my 40 minutes workout is my peaceful time why because of the inflammatory markers people are more prone to heart attacks go slow and steady after one or two years of being James Bond in the gym slow and steady then up your level so that's why I recommend wear an exercise variable when you work out do not cross 140 150 heart rate in the gym if you're on noice W you have a tea coffee machine in your office yes we do have I'm going to save you some money okay whatever you save you send to me as a New Year's gift next year if you drink one cup of coffee or tea with milk 100 ml milk 2 teaspoon sugar himaki if you drink two cups of tea or milk himaki I'm not picking on you you're the only person I can see in the seminar today okay forgive me for this but himaki if you drink two cups of milk and tea so white milk with sugar in the full year on one cup you're consuming 27 lers of milk if you drink two cups of tea or coffee you're consuming 55 lers of milk 55 right over here I've been very nice I said you need to walk for 59 days of 1 hour Walk To Burn only those cup one cup of coffee so many of you will say yes the 59 hours of walking is equivalent to 3 kages of weight gain a year and the two cups of coffee is equivalent to about 5.5 kages of weight gain in a year now you want to know why when you join left college and join the workplace you put on weight it's because you drink too much of milk tea and milk coffee solution black tea black coffee drink plain water the human race is eating too much drinking too much simple water black tea zero calorie zero calorie no weight came in the year no sir but it doesn't taste very good and all that stuff I'm used to having coffee I'm too stressed out okay little bit of caffeine over here little bit of black coffee sir it doesn't taste very good you are landlord or you tenant in your body tastebud is the owner or you are the owner food for thought these are small changes that result in macroscopic weight loss small changes just on tea coffee page print out this slide no put it in front of the tea coffee machine I did this in a Fortune 500 company the HR came back to me and said there was complaint from staff why are you taking away our tea or coffee we didn't take away the tea or coffee we put this poster up so the consumption according to them dropped by a whopping 65% in one month everyone shifted to green tea black tea so awareness allows you to get to the next level when you travel and you go different parts the world what what could you do eat a healthy snack before you leave home drink a lot of water before your meal when you go out to restaurants choose steam Grill roasted options share it with a colleague so you split it down don't do fried potatoes do let like can you get a steak or something like that say hey can you give me instead of potatoes could you give me vegetables sauteed vegetables always start with a soup or a salad research has shown that this glycemic index Spike the sugar spike is actually lower if you start with a salad or a soup I've worn one of those CGM devices last it's absolutely true so you eat all your gaspo all your salad all your vegetables first and then eat your grain last protein second uh choose tomato B sauces over creamy sauces that would be a good option so my cop my brain is made up of 60% fat bankage this is very interesting okay if you want to build a billion dollar organization the health of your employee is directly proportional to the brain that they incubate and the brain is made up of 60% of fat unfortunately sergy the fat in our diet is the bad fat that goes and reconstructs the Brain over a 10-e period so this 27 year old young team by the time they said 37 K seriously I have actually changed leadership teams over two years I've done a pin prick test checked the omega-3 levels B omega3 levels in the gutter then we started supplementing with flax seed we started supplementing with Tria seed we started eating more Walnut and we added two fish oil capsules or two vegan algae Omega capsules per day A year later we checked again the levels had gone up people on a verbal basis reported back to me how good they felt in the brain how deep their sleep became how less suicidal they felt I had four people come up to me saying we had like Suicidal Tendencies CLE my job shoot my boss I hope nobody wants to shoot you page but if you want safety don't don't get more security get more omega-3 in everyone's diet and 50% of this brain is made up of Omega-3 you know my wife says I'm very insensitive they dode did not eat correctly wife like how can you be so insensitive there is documented research from American prisons on violence and suicide they actually took two prison blocks in Brazil or America some Australia I remember reading the scientific paper so they fed them omega-3 and removed the bad fats and a multivit wom another block they didn't do anything the incidences of violence came down by over 55% incidences of suicidal tendency dropped almost 90% so when I see employees sad in an organization maybe it's the stimulus of the people around them but what if it's biological what if the fault is that you're not eating correctly what is it if the fault is that you do not know that your grandmother and grandfather did the wrong jwy and brought into your family and omeg ga3 deficient Gene ah this is 2024 so stop spending your money and buying a stupid iPhone that cost one and a half lakh rupees and spend some money on your bloody blood test and your genetic test and your health because you're going to change that iPhone you'll be able to buy a new iPhone but you won't be able to change your brain and then when you're 60 years old I retired from pun's company I'm good and then doctor says sorry sir 50% of your brain is gone now you have to take a uh Parkin cels and Alzheimer's medication all because you did not take care of your health in your 20s 30s and 40s okay I need to move faster because U got four more slides okay this is what you need to do okay all restaurants use palm oil globally palm oil is daa palm oil is neutral in flavor which is globally why it's preferred by all restaurants Palm oil has high level of arconic acids which blocks your arteries people say hey why is India getting so many heart attacks you want to do one thing page Google up the palm oil import over the last 10 years Google up how nobody noticed two years ago the Finance Minister dropped the import Duty on palm oil because during the pandemic the farmers couldn't grow enough of natural ground nut and all of these other oils so there was a deficiency of oil to keep markets held correctly for the Common Man for oil grain and oil is the most important not to go up dro the import Duty so palm oil would come in palm oil flooded the market wow great boom nobody has talked about this as a guy who studied at IM am aabad I don't advertise that a lot I read the budget and I was like whoa whil it's great for the economy and for the poor you're killing people so I put this together so page you and I decided hey Ryan Fernando let's start a restaurant in Dubai I'm like yes pun sir we started rest started Dubai he do the balance sheet sir we'll luse daa sir hey what man it's 125 rupees and all I am nutritionist we have to use organic Ki hey 580 rupees boss the omelet will cost 500 dams nobody will buy so this is the reason why heart attacks are happening because we're eating more outside food when I was young I ate out once a month cuz I didn't have the money today I eat out five times a week because I have the money and I have the resources to click an app to get it to my office and yeah when you want to enjoy it what do you do pun your team like sir take them for a hiking trip instead of a meal tell Ryan Fernando said so eating should be the last thing

and uh just before uh we begin with all the questions I would like I I see pankaj is all set with his first question probably so page over to you uh if you have anything to to add thanks Ryan thank you so much once again we remain grateful to you to come and join and guide our team and uh client and our well wishers in the first week of January despite your busy schedule but really thankful to you uh quite a good takeway for me of course I've been following through your team uh uh you know a couple of things on a daily basis but a few more takea away for me today especially sleeping on time uh whether 6 or8 hours that's a different discussion but at least we start sleeping on time yeah uh coming very quickly uh you know in the interest of time you know the recently again that came from bangaluru from Mr Naran morti when he quoted that one must work for 70 hours and when we hear youth complaining about work and you know work in health or work life balance what's your take on the commment which Mr Nar M made about that youth should work more and uh work work life balance is not uh the discussion should for them yeah I'm sure you heard of that when yes yes I did I did I did I was asked this question once before and uh there are two parts to this okay I ask every youngster would if given a chance would you go and try and win an Olympic medal and most people say yes you are Olympians in the workplace your gold medal is the bank balance you accumulate every year I was the youngest business head uh in a pharmaceutical South Indian marw firm at the age of 31 the next youngest business head was 61 they only took old people the reason I became the youngest business head is because I worked very hard did I ignore my health absolutely yes I did so now I am on the other side of the coin as a health coach so I tell the youngsters work intelligently smart use AI use your technology be disciplined don't get distracted by social media at work so be productive for four hours or 5 hours the balance time when you go away home 5 hours 6 hours at home get that one hour of workout get that uh nutrition at work in the morning before you go to work and when you come back from the work bang on sleep as much as possible breathe in your car so when you do all of these hacks assume you want to hit 70 hours what is 70 hours so for those of you who work 5 days a week it means you have to cross 13 hours a day which is quite tough but if you work 6 days a week little bit easier if you work s days a week quite easy 7even t a 7 10 hours a day now as an entrepreneur earlier I was an employee as an entrepreneur I will tell you the pros and cons of being an entrepreneur the cons of being an entrepreneur is there's no clock in and clock out you are married to your business you're married to your employees you're married to always working because it is your other baby but if you're an employee it is not your baby but my advice to everybody is if you want a larger pile of the share of profit it comes in your salaries and bonuses then you need to work for that it's a reward system it's a capitalistic system in the process of doing this 70 hours if you do the calculation 8 hours 128s are 72 you got 72 hours for Sleep 70 hours for working so the balance is how you manage that extracurricular time and in this 10 hours of working you eat well you eat really well you eat expensive and you make sure you negotiate with your boss that you can go for a 45 minute workout during your lunch break or you get a chance to leave at 5:00 go work out and come back to the office and work again or you leave your office late at 9:00 in the evening work out but that's a bad idea because I told you not to eat 3 hours before going to sleep so then you need to contact me and how we can reject the whole thing and men should work out in fasted state which means the best time for men to work out is morning as soon as you wake up go work out shower get to work women should work out in fasted state which is all the women I would advise a work out um around 3:00 in the afternoon you have an early lunch at 12:00 and work out at 3:00 so these are my recommendations to people um and the choice is personal Evolution has made people uh to to be the Warriors in the tribe so you'll run and go to the next Village and plunder then there'll be the 30% of the tribe which is they'll see what the leader is doing and follow the leader and then there's 30% the tribe that'll sit like I'm not going to go to war today so Evolution has made some of us to be go-getters some of us to sit in the middle of the pie and some of us to be completely laid back figure out which one you are there's no harm in it and if you're the guy who's going to be like sitting down and you guys do all the work open up a beach hack and go and run a business from there that's the best thing you could do thanks man thank you so much you know uh you know very very useful I think your message is clear and I we will see definitely if uh we could have some option of jimming during uh just after the lunch hours or in the lunch break very quickly second one you know we've been hearing about a lot about intermittent fasting what quickly you like to share you know what is the right way of executing intermittent fasting if that work you did spoke about the you know religious what we have you know this fasting and otherwise but intermittent fasting has been growing I mean have been people have been using this what's your suggestions to our listeners very very simple there are two ways to do intermittent fasting either you're a morning person or you're a night person if you're a morning person and you love your breakfast eat early then eat very early your dinner finish your dinner at 5:00 if you're an evening person then eat your breakfast at 12:31 and eat your last meal at 8:00 this is the best way to eat intermittent fasting the novice intermittent faster can do 8 hours of eating window meaning I'll eat my breakfast at 10:00 so 10 to 6:00 is 8 hours or do 12 to 8:00 which is 8 hours this is the nvest the intermediat guys are 6 hours eat your breakfast at 6:00 12:00 and finish your dinner by 6:00 the the pros the guys who eat at 2:00 one meal and eat another meal at 6:00 and then they're done I think this is the best way to do intermittent fasting the scientific way also is to put a CGM glucose monitor on you for the heck of it and figure out when you eat how do you get sugar Spike so I recently did a client and we found out that her morning fasting created more sugar spikes so we shifted her entire eating to the morning half and so her only problem was after 5:00 I feel like eating because all my life I ate so we came up with Solutions which distracted her where she just drank specialized herbal teas or water and within 9 to 10 days she completely changed her eating cycle now what's the biggest problem when she goes out with friends they are all saying let's go to this restaurant she's saying let's go for a movie I don't want to eat let's go shopping but I don't want to eat and if they say we're going to eat she has a cup of green tea along with them so I think intermittent fasting is a thumbs up if you're overweight if you've got cholesterol diabetes IES or hyp hypertension I'm sorry BP hypertension same thing or any brain fog or digestive problems then please consult a medical nutritionist my my team are medical nutritionist we will do it scientifically for you so that you don't harm your body thanks one of the I will just pick up well we had have few questions let me go to the audience one of the audience have asked that what precautions should I take as I just finish cancer treatment okay so this is important we have an oncology division in our company and the the Benchmark is depending on male or female in female most of the cancers are driven by estrogen or progesterone from breast cancer ovarian point of view so there are certain foods you should eat and certain foods you should not eat if you're related to cancer with blood cancer digestive system cancer which is any of the organs of the human body then we have to look at what is the treatment that was given to you and when you have come out of cancer this is my solution number one do a food allergy intolerance test from Germany that will tell you which are the foods which will do kui in your body remove those Foods second do a DNA genetic test for your nutrition so you'll get the genetic Viewpoint of how to see the nutritional deficiencies in your body and then accordingly construct third do a poop a stool a potty sample DNA analysis called the microbiome analysis now this will give you a bird's eye view of how your microbes digest the food love certain foods hate certain foods so when you put all of this together now you're eating very scientifically as a choice of foods and then that's the first one then the second one is how much should this person who just suffered from cancer now eat so step on a wing scale what is your muscle what is your fat oh this person requires 1,200 calories a day now we know that when you feed cancer with sugar the cancer tumor grows so this person has come out of cancer treatment assuming that you've got all the cancer tumors we now know that this person probably was feeding too much of sugar to the cancer tumors so now the second decision is do I give more calories than required by this person or lesser and when I give calories cies the percentage of fat carbohydrate and protein is accordingly decided for that individual based on genetics and body weight and cancer treatment so as I always say I'm the judge I cannot pass execution of judgment on what are the right things to do but I do know that foods that are rich in polyphenols flavonoids antoy so these are the greens the purples and all of that stuff are really good now I will share something with you I recently had a breast cancer lady and I told my dad give a resol resol is found in grapes and fortunately by the grace of God I have an amazing team and an amazing software so when we put everything together it came back there was a study that resol for estrogen positive women actually promotes breast tissue tumor growth so even celebrity nutritionist Ryan Fernando knows Fu it's like saying some guy stock market everyone is a Financial expert everyone is a nutritionist so when we come to medical conditions it's a case basis analysis where food is a therapeutic drug so in my interest to improve anti-aging recovery to this lady and because she was a marathon runner my first line of thought was high antioxidants which is the best guy asai Berry so asai Berry passed through but resol didn't pass through this is why people with cancer have to work with a medical dietician and not Wing It fortunately for me the latest doctors at Sloan in the Cancer Treatment Center of America are now all working with medical dietitians in India slowly they've started coming to us but the normal thing is do you know that most of your cancers have come because of your diet or your environment so food for thought that's why I say go organic reduce the chemical exposure uh reduce your stress breathe better take a chill pill thanks another one from our one of our colleague you know which actually inspire everyone in our office Ken Ken he said grow more mus yeah that's a resolution she has asked later a question What vitamin supplements are essential for vegetarians or women in their 20s 30s 40s and 50s so I built neutralite in India which is the largest food supplement brand I used to work for them and we would prescribe supplements to all Distributors take take take take take take take fast forward 25 years I now have my own nutrition clinic and I do the testing and you don't need a multivitamin unless you have a nutritional deficiency so step one do the Complete vitamin and mineral blood test once a year if money is not an issue do it twice a year if any vitamin or mineral is deficient pick up the phone call up Ryan Fernando I will help prescribe from my team what you should do for a food PL first assume you have low vitamin B9 pist 6 months lat a test has it gone up or take a standalone vitamin B9 alternate T what doctors do they they give you a prescription for 30 days take for 30 days but do you have a genetic receptor that is not absorbing vitamin B9 and therefore you need a lifelong management of BB9 so a girl taking a vitamin or mineral actually is not a standardized practice in my opinion I come back to the bio individuality you are going to remember me 10 years later Ryan Fernando said bio individuality there is going to be an Apple iPhone bloody you put your finger on it it'll take out a blood sample and tell you sir G today ma'am G today you have low vitamin B9 please eat more of this bio individuality so taking a multivitamin if you want to take a multivitamin on your own prescription the safest thing I don't advise it but the safest way is do it twice a week Saturday Sunday take a multivitamin with your breakfast sir why should why don't I take seven days a week you could overdose your body is smart enough to know that this is a chemical is not coming from food so whenever you take a multivitamin take it with your food so that vitamin C and that zinc and all is like Hey by you ate nice baked beans no I'm going along with the baked beans into the body so that would be uh the thing uh am I anti supplement no I'm not anti supplement I'm actually Pro supplement but I'm not pro supplement when every person on the planet thinks that they are a nutritionist because then I can sit down and argue with you saying that you're actually harming your body we had this incident where this lady took ayurvedic um herbals and um so she came to us and her hemoglobin dropped in two three months it was 12.8 then it dropped to 9.6 so I asked all the questions did you have Deni do you have malaria did you have so nothing nothing liver was showing very bad parameters like what are you taking she says no my aurvedic doctor gave me something I said go meet a hematologist and please tell him you have liver poisoning she didn't believe me she went to that guy that guy did some extra test on says they found out heavy lead content in her so she assumed that ashwag gandha very good for brain health safe now ashwag gandha is okay but the compounding of ashwag gandha by that ayurvedic manufacturer in traditional practice of a weather was to roll the medicine with heavy metals so when people say Do You Believe In Aura of course I believe in Aura the same way my grandfather rode a cycle I believe in riding a cycle but I also have a luxury vehicle let's advance to 2014 where prescription of nutrition prescription of superfoods prescription of supplements should be the main state so learn more about it and look at the end of the day stop experimenting with your body you have only one rolls rice this is like page driving rolls R gives him a brand manual says boss don't off-road this car on the Dubai desert huh page is like we drive this in the Dubai desert next day it takes to the mechanic sir left ball bearing is gone of the road right you went offroading you broke it you're born and he could buy another old rice then but what I'm trying to communicate to you is your body can't be changed so in the interest of not breaking your body in 20s 30s and 40s eat healthy eat organic do a blood test of vitamins and minerals if anything is low get in touch with Baba ran great one of attende has asked how to get some nutrition in when someone has eating disorder like recommendation of any food items so eating disorder is a psychological issue plaguing a lot of our teenage girls these days uh because of the image problems uh because and and just to share with all the parents in this group and all mostly with girls because they image conscious and even though their weight may be overweight or I have had girls who are 38 kgs thinking they are overweight so it is a psychological problem for which I work with a psychiatrist on my team number one so please please do not think you can self-help your child get medical Intervention number two no matter what you say which food is good or bad or ugly that child if they psychologically do not work on the mental part of anorexia or Bulma which are the medical conditions or the eating disorder conditions will never consume even what you say scientifically I've had a girl who used to come she used to drink one and a half lit of water before walking into my clinic this so that she'd weigh 1 and a half kg more and my team asked me sir how did you find out I was like dude before I went I went to the toilet I went and stood outside my office and I'm looking at the car down and I can see this chick SE sitting the car and drinking water so I just asked her casually how much water you drink I just had a sip of water so I I I said okay wait I went down I spoke to the D like no she drank to she asked me to buy two bottles of water and she finished two bottles of water so anorexia and eating disorders are a very complex psychological model first I can give you the best foods on the planet a date or guava a calorie dense Dr fruit Lao but would that kid want to eat that is the question so we do have three people on our team liia Ru and soas who are psychological eating disorder specialist I do not I don't do that um I'm not being able to convince because I'm very logical I'm like dude just skinny your BM is wrong please eat I'm like landlord ATT tenant I don't have like I'll Kajol you to come out of your uh tenant into landlord model so with children we need a little bit of finish uh it is a long process uh and we need to give them a lot of confidence building measures like they're beautiful they're wonderful as children many of these children the fault is the parents huh by the way parents you guys have eaten wrong and all of you are 27 to 35 if you're smoking and drinking and deciding to have an accidental pregnancy I'll punch you in your bloody nose because you'll have only one kid so if you decide to have a kid Don't drink don't consume alcohol and eat correctly so your sperm and your egg is absolute perfection so that soul that is roaming around in the dun that comes into your sperm and egg Fusion is a perfect Soul Thing roll R sperm or rolls rice egg the problem today with all our diseases psychological problems and xxyz I just look at the parents dude you screwed up you screwed up at work you ate wrong you did not sleep enough you smoked too much you had too much alcohol take it from a guy who has seen thousands of cases autism Down syndrome children with deformity sometimes I I just like I'm just so grateful to God that I have a normal kid and my kid is dyslexic he can't spell properly he gets 2 on 25 in Hindi I'm like shabash beta 2 and 25 you got one Mark more than last time children are special they're born to us so please when you become a parent you decide to become a parent don't have an accidental pregnancy have a planned pregnancy sorry page I get very passionate about this topic because I see the future with people who are 70 who come to me and if I ask them what would you do if you went back when you're 25 the first thing people say take care of my health learn more in my job make more money when I'm younger because as I get older I don't have the health or bandwidth capacity to go to that level so these are small small things that I would say to everyone listening in today I agree the two last question one is from vij from Saudi Arabia vitamin D3 and B12 deficiency is common issue with most veggies in Gulf so this is not only in Gulf this is the entire Indian genomic race has a vitamin B12 and D even I have a vitamin D deficiency so what I'm doing is I'm testing twice a year all my vitamins and minerals and I know after about six or seven testings that I have to take vitamin D twice a month 60,000 I to keep my levels at 40 to 50 don't try and be bottom of the class in your vitamin D and b12 levels don't try and be 218 in B12 and don't try and be 30 in vitamin D try and be at 50 levels 50 nanogram levels in vitamin D and try and be at around 300 to 400 all vegetarians will not get B12 in their diet you need to take a nutritional supplement for that take a sublingual which you put on your mouth it is called not methy cobalamine it's called it's not called cobalamine it's called methy cobalamine vitamin B12 methy cobalamine level yeah we have one question from chel Individual resident in the pgs are able to prepare their own meels so what should they consume to maintain their health very very good question this is most of my team so what I tell them see pgs we get very very basic food very basic and that PG is like all restaurant owners they will not use olive oil and all they cheap daa cheap ration rice everything is cheap so first things first those who live in pgs when you order out don't order Biryani from a local chiper restaurant order a good healthy meal when you're eating out if it's three four times a week number one number two when you go to work stop at the local supermarket or order online from the organic stores carrot cucumber tomato keep it in a tiffen box carry it to work cut a carrot make friends with the housekeeping my housekeeping loves me every month I give her 500 rupees I'm like Mary every day 11:00 one guava so I pay for the guava I pay for the carrot and the Tomato but I pay her 500 Rupees to cut it specially for me and give it to me so all if you earn enough yeah pay the housekeeping domestic staff to get you that healthy cut salad cut fruit at your desk look at dry fruit ldo because of the thing or do what I used to do I used to keep some pistas and almonds and walnut and I used to pack it in Ziploc bags and make five of them and keep it in my office so every day I would eat pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds something so that's another way to get nutrition do a blood test vitamins and minerals if anything is low take a multivitamin twice a week for those of you who are skinny like me you could buy a protein shake without sweetener in it and mix it in an Armond or coconut milk or normal milk if you're not allergic to milk other point that you should do is once a week make sure that the one meal you cook yourself or go to a friend's house and cook and all the ladies and all the mothers if there are any women watching this seminar you have no idea the power of your touch research has shown that food water vibrates at a real frequency when I serve my kid I pray dear Lord bless this food I'm giving it to my son I didn't even prepare it but I'm praying to the angels and the creators of the universe and I'm saying make this food energetic today we can't measure it but mark my words in the next 100 years we will be able to measure the quantum energy signature coming off food who has grown it who has harvested it who has carried it who has sold it to you who has cut it who has prepared it and who has served it to you all of this will add to the energy coming to and if you don't know anything of this before you eat ladies and gentlemen do what I do I pray over my food for 10 seconds thank you dear Lord thank you Creator thank you bhagan thank you Allah thank you Vishnu thank you Shiva for this food in front of me Bless the people that gave it to me Bless the people that provide me the ability to eat this food dear food as you enter my body please heal my Cal muscles today was karate so broke my calf muscles dear dear food also heal my brain I had too much of a session with 360 TF today so my brain has gone full Bea so please rejuvenate my brain thank you start eating it's very important this is one way PG people can change the energy signature of your food I know I sound like a quack Guru or something that you have nothing lose to lose to just try this out next we have one interesting question like how to avoid the mlight Cravings if you have have midnight Cravings most likely your B12 and vitamin D and hemoglobin is low so when people have midnight Cravings Cravings is the human evolution of the body come here so it's most likely you have a vitamin or mineral deficiency so what I would do is I would add soda sparkling water with electrolytes or salt in it with lemon in it in the evenings I would take a magnesium supplement at night I would drink chamomile tea and then eat two large pieces or half a credit size of 100% dark cocoa chocolate and tell me in 3 months if your sugar Cravings do not disappear if they do not disappear you have a insulin problem or sugar problem and you're moving towards diabetes so then you need to do an hba1c blood test a fasting glucose blood test or homas score and an insulin fasting level when I look at all of this I will tell you if you're moving in in the direction of becoming a diabetic and we can see it a decade in advance I can see it 10 years in advance that you're going to become a diabetic with the blood test so then I tell you this information then you're like okay pastry at night no Ryan said eat two pistas two walnuts two wenss just eat that drink water go to sleep and you have midnight Cravings because you're not supposed to be awake at midnight you're supposed to go to sleep at 8:00 at night no no sir how you can go to sleep we created electricity you know but evolution was last 200,000 years in homo sapian but electricity is only last 100 years our grandmothers and grandfathers created so many children because they have no Netflix no they to entertain each other so by the time the sun went down what you do put the children to sleep and then you banged each other think about it we should be bed in bed by 10:00 please everyone go to sleep early stop watching Netflix Netflix is controllable you could watch it early morning on your way to work right U I'll just take up two more questions one posted by pun but just before that uh this is a query by most of the women out there and we've received this as a question uh you know while we were doing these registrations during my periods of menstrual cycle I experienced vomiting and food doesn't digest well what should be the ideal food to eat I've had this condition before where women don't feel like eating during their menstration and this comes from Evolution a lot of women see women there are different types of women okay women are created for birthing a lot of children women are there to take care of the birth of children but do not produce children and there are women who are warriors so and this is evolution point of view so what I believe is that when a person cannot eat there are underlining conditions of maybe pcod or thyroid so there is a hormonal fluctuation and it affects the gut microbiome the bacteria in the gut who say stop don't give me anything I don't want to digest any food now in such a condition we rechange the entire weight of a woman over a six-month one-year period how she eats for nutritional deficiencies magnesium deficiency iodine deficiency thyroid deficiency then we put in foods like red clover tea give her a vitamin E Avon during the 5 days before the start of a menstration cycle shift over to foods like in AA which we call call as low heat Foods cucumber micro greens a salad maybe a little bit of curd rice pomegranate and rice not heavy food and as I said before a human lady if she's not planning to have a pregnancy can go three days without food just have electrolytes and water and put some amount of food to prevent acidity burn could be a banana could be a guava so you can even have fruits during the you don't need to do Dal chavel roty because your ancestors thought you eat Dal CH rotti at breakfast lunch dinner the only issue comes is the woman is any IC has low fertin and has low body weight then this advice that I just gave is defunct then I would request this said person to meet a medical dietitian who works on what we call as menstration cycle issues and try and figure out what is the best eating pattern what is the best superfood pattern and what is the best uh supplements that they G in fact there's something known as seed cycling there are certain dry fruits and seeds that are given in the first 14 days of the menstruation cycle and the certain type of Drive fruits are eat in the next 14 days of the menstruation cycle it's called seed cycling for menstration you can Google this up it's actively available on the internet and you can do your own jard but if money is not an issue please hire a dietitian and work with the dietician like a financial adviser last question and I apologize that we we posy of time and we don't want R to be holding back for so you can of course email your questions I've sent the IDS where you can email uh the last question for the evening is from Saudi Arabia Mr Chandra Shar and J raan has asked how to avoid thyroid uh through food habits for a person who is age of 25 so first of all if a person has thyroid at the age of 25 the TSH which is the thyroid stimulating hormone is dependent on 10 nutritive molecules which is inclusive of protein vitamin B12 vitamin C magnesium selenium chromium zinc and a host of other things I can't remember all 10 so when you eat correctly this goes to the pitutary and says Hey by TSH B now when there's a nutritional deficient TSH so thyroid like boy thyroid stimulating hormone come stimulate me produce thyroid nutrition I'm not talking about being gundu or fat or muscle no no no I'm talking about micronutrition so the first things first is to look at the micronutrition blood test second is to look if this person has a family history of thyroid problem where thyroid can be genetically also having an issue and I had many cases where I have to take people of milk and gluten and the thyroid has improved so look at removing gluten from wheat Bley and dry look at removing lactose or milk for a period of 6 months improve your nutrition take a multivitamin twice a week after doing a blood test meet a nutrition or dietician this should work in terms of the foods that slap the thyroid in the old school we had something known as goitrogenic foods which are foods like cauliflower strawberri spinach uh ragi which or or millets which did not agree with the thyroid and hence they are avoided so please meet with a dietitian at Quan nutrition clinics it it cost 16,500 rupees for a three-month plan uh at the Quan nutrition clinics you can do all of these things and blood test and then get a new diet plan every month and then experiment with that and and hopefully at the age of 25 we can actually reverse any thyroid issues because people should get thyroid only at 50 or 60 not at 25 if it's at 25 there's there's a nutritional deficiency diet problem right uh thank you Ryan that was that was really interesting thank you for all the tips and I I can tell you Ryan from last year's time we we did have our office flooded with camomile tea uh just after your webinar and uh I you know that's that's something that we did as as as a practice you know himaki the thing is there are all gurus and experts out there but going from the level of knowledge awareness or spiritual following to practicing it in daily life requires Community effort so I'm really happy that it started in your offices and places and this financial Community because um look at running in some parts of the world it's literally a craze right so if you go to like Amsterdam and all everyone Cycles everyone walks right it is a community ideology so I believe that the financial guys are some of the most astute Visionaries actuaries they're able to see Based on data so if you as a team if you as a team start with 10 15 people 20 people it creates a moment I've been doing this for 15 years and maybe I have a fan fan following of about one lakh people but the thought process himan is if he can get camomile te in the office if he can get 10,000 steps if you can do all of these small small things changes diet plan comes secondary exercise plan comes secondary first make these changes right and and we also did the implementation I think for the last six months in office everybody walks after lunch and we do uh you know few steps that we that we definitely do uh we also have small small competitions going on amongst the team members about how many steps each one did did for a particular day so that's something that keeps us inspiring and thank you for inspiring us uh I'll probably put it across
