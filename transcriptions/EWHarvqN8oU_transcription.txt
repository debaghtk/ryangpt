Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiovascular health, and its potential impact on atherosclerosis has been a subject of interest in scientific studies. Atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in arterial walls, is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Vitamin C is renowned for its antioxidant properties, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammationâ€”two key factors in the development of atherosclerosis. Moreover, vitamin C is involved in the synthesis of collagen, a structural protein essential for maintaining the integrity of blood vessels. Research suggests that adequate vitamin C levels may contribute to healthier arteries by preventing the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a process that initiates plaque formation. While more research is needed to fully understand the nuanced relationship between vitamin C and atherosclerosis, incorporating vitamin C-rich foods into a balanced diet is a sensible nutritional strategy for supporting cardiovascular health.
