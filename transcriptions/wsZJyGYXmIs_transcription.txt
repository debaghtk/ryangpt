[24.24 - 29.08] more protein so I'm going to create a
[26.52 - 31.80] list of restaurants around your office
[29.08 - 34.00] space from you can order healthier meals
[31.80 - 36.28] now check out my meal today I've ordered
[34.00 - 38.80] a brilliant Meal which has got my
[36.28 - 40.28] protein in it it's got my salad in it
[38.80 - 42.60] some zucchini which is going to give me
[40.28 - 44.56] a lot of fiber and they've got beetroot
[42.60 - 47.20] beetroot is one of my favorites because
[44.56 - 50.28] it reduces blood pressure and calms you
[47.20 - 52.32] during work now the biggest issue I have
[50.28 - 54.84] with this healthy meal that I've ordered
[52.32 - 57.88] is the amount of rice or Roy that they
[54.84 - 59.76] will send you and I are not laborers we
[57.88 - 62.00] are desk chalkies we use our brain we
[59.76 - 64.92] don't do much of physical movement so so
[62.00 - 67.60] much of rice is not required so I tell
[64.92 - 70.64] every person going to work you need to
[67.60 - 73.64] carry two of this in your laptop bag or
[70.64 - 76.04] your napsack one is a fruit peeler one
[73.64 - 78.92] is a bowl the bowl should be designed
[76.04 - 81.64] for your carbohydrate content your oats
[78.92 - 83.24] intake your cfake content keep this as
[81.64 - 86.72] your portion measure and carry it to
[83.24 - 89.48] work this is my bowl of rice I put about
[86.72 - 92.20] 6 tablespoons of rice in this and the
[89.48 - 94.88] rest of the the rice I've got a secret I
[92.20 - 97.12] share my ordered meal with my colleague
[94.88 - 100.08] so India half your portion meal by
[97.12 - 101.40] sharing it with your colleague so these
[100.08 - 104.68] are the some of the quick tips that you
[101.40 - 107.60] could do do not drink water before your
[104.68 - 110.84] meal in copious quantities take a small
[107.60 - 112.96] sip of 50 ml during your meal try to
[110.84 - 114.96] reduce the amount of water taken so the
[112.96 - 117.96] acid in your stomach can help break down
[114.96 - 122.08] the food and digest it my quick tip to
[117.96 - 123.92] India eat early lunch finish it off in
[122.08 - 126.48] 10 to 15 minutes and then take a break
[123.92 - 129.52] of half an hour relaxing normally watch
[126.48 - 132.00] some videos my podcast or I read the
[129.52 - 136.00] newspaper you need time to let that food
[132.00 - 138.24] digest also please don't eat standing up
[136.00 - 140.32] please sit down and if you can sit in a
[138.24 - 143.28] corner cross-legged in the ancient
[140.32 - 145.36] Tradition Way that's even better where
[143.28 - 148.60] you have to bend over to eat your food
[145.36 - 152.12] which helps in allowing you not to eat
[148.60 - 154.64] too much if you have more ideas on how
[152.12 - 156.84] you can make your recipes healthier
[154.64 - 158.56] share them with me or comment below what
[156.84 - 161.84] are the healthier recipes that you take
[158.56 - 164.40] to work and I on my hand will send you a
[161.84 - 166.80] few healthy lunch recipe options that
[164.40 - 168.84] you can pack from home so today let's
[166.80 - 171.40] Deep dive into my healthy lunch ordered
[168.84 - 173.56] from out now first things first this is
[171.40 - 177.44] a lot of rice so I'm going to do a
[173.56 - 180.04] portion control by taking out only what
[177.44 - 182.68] I want to eat which is about 6 to 8
[180.04 - 185.24] tablespoons of rice for my height and
[182.68 - 187.72] weight now if you do not know your body
[185.24 - 189.64] fat percentage and your weight come to
[187.72 - 192.48] us at the quad clinics and I'll arrange
[189.64 - 194.68] for you to get your body assessment done
[192.48 - 196.56] now I know that my visceral fat is at 4
[194.68 - 198.44] and if I eat all of this rice for one
[196.56 - 200.12] year my visceral fat is going to go up
[198.44 - 203.04] by three points my body age is going to
[200.12 - 204.92] go up by 5 years so portion control with
[203.04 - 206.48] a bowl is very important so that's the
[204.92 - 209.88] amount of rice that I'm actually going
[206.48 - 211.04] to eat but more importantly my mouth
[209.88 - 212.44] actually watering right now is I'm
[211.04 - 215.80] looking forward to having the chicken
[212.44 - 218.68] breast that's my protein that's ideal on
[215.80 - 220.80] a fat loss program I would do only the
[218.68 - 223.32] chicken breast no carbohydrates and I
[220.80 - 226.12] would do my salad with tomatoes cucumber
[223.32 - 227.76] and zucchini and the beetroot now cures
[226.12 - 229.84] normally give you a little bit of mouth
[227.76 - 232.08] flavor because when you eat rice you
[229.84 - 234.76] need a curry along with it but both the
[232.08 - 237.64] carbohydrates and the curry will be a
[234.76 - 239.96] weight gain program for you so if you
[237.64 - 244.56] can avoid that at the lunch time what I
[239.96 - 247.24] would do is I would do a three
[244.56 - 249.12] tablespoon drizzle for the amount of
[247.24 - 251.16] rice that I eat for my body weight so if
[249.12 - 252.96] you're a 100 kg guy well you would do
[251.16 - 255.12] half of this if you had to lose weight
[252.96 - 257.64] but if you're a 50 kg woman you would do
[255.12 - 260.20] 4 tablespoons of rice and 2 tbspoon of
[257.64 - 262.16] Curry now you get it what's happening
[260.20 - 264.92] over here is when the restaurants send
[262.16 - 267.32] food to you they have a standardized
[264.92 - 269.20] portion and that's why you're putting on
[267.32 - 271.08] weight at work because you're eating
[269.20 - 273.00] food from outside maybe not a healthy
[271.08 - 275.40] restaurant maybe a healthy restaurant
[273.00 - 278.64] and even this from a healthy restaurant
[275.40 - 282.72] this is equivalent for a 90 kg man and I
[278.64 - 284.40] am only 70 kgs so that 20 kgs the food
[282.72 - 286.56] that is coming to feed that extra person
[284.40 - 288.40] is causing me to gain weight so potion
[286.56 - 290.68] control I also want to talk to you about
[288.40 - 293.04] why I carry a fruit peeler you see I
[290.68 - 294.80] feel hungry at 11:00 and 5:00 in the
[293.04 - 298.64] evening and that's when you can order
[294.80 - 302.16] Samosa bada kachori chai biscuits
[298.64 - 305.40] instead carry an apple with you take a
[302.16 - 307.72] fruit peeler peel the skin because when
[305.40 - 310.00] you peel the skin it's got a wax coating
[307.72 - 313.00] the apple is going to fill you it's low
[310.00 - 314.88] calorie low glycemic index a great way
[313.00 - 317.76] to keep your brain getting a little bit
[314.88 - 320.28] of fruit sugars to function very well in
[317.76 - 322.16] the office but not have weight gain a
[320.28 - 323.88] lot of you are doing two cups of tea
[322.16 - 326.52] three cups of coffee a day with milk and
[323.88 - 329.32] sugar that's 5 kg weight gain reduce
[326.52 - 331.52] that to black tea or black coffee
[329.32 - 333.72] without sugar and better still if you
[331.52 - 336.76] don't want any of these just have
[333.72 - 338.12] sparkling water or soda water and I've
[336.76 - 340.80] always seen that when I feel a little
[338.12 - 343.44] sluggish having a little cold water
[340.80 - 345.04] wakes me up these are few of my tips and
[343.44 - 347.36] this is what I would recommend for India
[345.04 - 349.52] to do when you're ordering outside hey
