[10.80 - 14.88] so um
[12.32 - 17.76] devika why did you decide to do a
[14.88 - 20.56] genetic nutrition testing for i can what
[17.76 - 22.96] was the predominant reason
[20.56 - 24.56] see i go to his pediatrician and they
[22.96 - 25.44] recommend me
[24.56 - 27.76] food
[25.44 - 30.00] food stuff to eat
[27.76 - 31.92] but more or less i'm very confused what
[30.00 - 34.16] to give him because they all give me
[31.92 - 35.84] conflicting foods to eat when i go to
[34.16 - 39.28] the emergency one and to my normal
[35.84 - 42.08] pediatrician like last week i went for
[39.28 - 44.32] uh because he was unwell
[42.08 - 45.76] and i asked her whether i could give her
[44.32 - 48.32] give him banana
[45.76 - 50.24] and i understand that banana is not
[48.32 - 52.48] supposed to be given when you have cold
[50.24 - 54.56] so the potassium
[52.48 - 57.12] you know the pediatric
[54.56 - 59.60] doctor at the emergency said that you
[57.12 - 60.96] can give the banana also when i was
[59.60 - 62.64] talking to suharsani who was the
[60.96 - 64.00] pediatric nutritionist
[62.64 - 66.16] for nutrition
[64.00 - 68.72] she recommended the genetic test to let
[66.16 - 71.68] me know whether what kind of foodstuff
[68.72 - 73.44] that i can give him at this small child
[71.68 - 76.08] you know in terms of
[73.44 - 79.44] the protein carbs and fat percentage
[76.08 - 82.48] which can be perfected right away
[79.44 - 84.08] uh rather than later and you know it
[82.48 - 87.76] also gives me
[84.08 - 90.08] the input of a lifetime so i can use it
[87.76 - 91.60] i can so you don't feel that spending 30
[90.08 - 93.68] 000 rupees on a genetic test is
[91.60 - 96.56] expensive no i don't think it is
[93.68 - 99.04] expansion because when you see that it
[96.56 - 101.28] is 30 000 rupees over what value that
[99.04 - 102.80] you get over a lifetime it's actually
[101.28 - 104.32] extremely cheap
[102.80 - 106.56] uh overall
[104.32 - 108.64] let's look at it this way it is 20 30
[106.56 - 109.76] 000 now it might be very very expensive
[108.64 - 111.52] tomorrow
[109.76 - 113.60] so it's much more cheaper than doing it
[111.52 - 116.88] today than doing it
[113.60 - 118.64] so ask me as a pediatric nutritionist uh
[116.88 - 121.44] what takeaways will you get from the
[118.64 - 124.16] genetic test see uh the genetic test is
[121.44 - 126.08] going to tell me uh what
[124.16 - 128.80] icon is going to
[126.08 - 130.32] have to eat in terms of the vitamins and
[128.80 - 132.64] they're going to have to eat in terms of
[130.32 - 134.56] this diet and um like you all know
[132.64 - 136.88] genetic test is a one-time test it's not
[134.56 - 138.00] gonna change today he's seven months of
[136.88 - 140.24] age it's not going to change when you
[138.00 - 142.16] become seven years so it's all about
[140.24 - 144.80] what he has to eat and what are his
[142.16 - 147.12] requirements now this generic test tells
[144.80 - 148.32] me his vitamin profile which means it
[147.12 - 150.96] tells me
[148.32 - 153.84] is vitamin b
[150.96 - 155.60] how are they in his body genetically is
[153.84 - 158.16] it going to be high is it going to be
[155.60 - 159.92] enough or is it going to be less so if i
[158.16 - 162.00] know at the age of 7 months that his
[159.92 - 164.72] vitamin b for example is going to be a
[162.00 - 166.96] little low i make sure that his diet has
[164.72 - 168.40] adequate amount of vitamin b coming in
[166.96 - 170.80] not only today but throughout his
[168.40 - 173.68] lifetime similarly it also tells me
[170.80 - 175.04] about his um you know for the mother's
[173.68 - 177.04] point of view it tells him about the
[175.04 - 179.52] brain performance the memory the reading
[177.04 - 181.36] and all of that but the type of exercise
[179.52 - 183.68] that he is going to benefit from
[181.36 - 185.84] genetically so if the mom knows that
[183.68 - 188.48] he's going to be good with cardiac i
[185.84 - 189.68] mean with the arabic exercises then
[188.48 - 193.60] she's going to make sure she puts him
[189.68 - 195.44] into a sport which has such kind of a
[193.60 - 197.60] training routine don't you feel it's too
[195.44 - 199.36] early at seven months to do the gene
[197.60 - 201.28] testing
[199.36 - 203.52] why is it too early it is not really
[201.28 - 204.72] because it's a one time test i can i'd
[203.52 - 207.52] rather know in the beginning of
[204.72 - 210.16] everything rather know it later on uh
[207.52 - 213.04] when i am not able to be able to change
[210.16 - 215.28] it like i believe that what you teach
[213.04 - 217.44] your child today is what he's going to
[215.28 - 218.80] implement later on at the age of five if
[217.44 - 220.40] you do this test your child is going to
[218.80 - 221.76] be the last person to eat what you ask
[220.40 - 223.92] him to eat
[221.76 - 226.80] uh you know he's seven months old and
[223.92 - 228.48] he's already started to eat solids so i
[226.80 - 230.56] think it's the right time to know you
[228.48 - 233.60] know what kind of solids that he's going
[230.56 - 235.28] to eat so we have the right balance in
[233.60 - 238.08] terms of
[235.28 - 241.04] carbs proteins and fat right from the
[238.08 - 243.60] beginning rather than know it later
[241.04 - 245.36] so in that sense it makes it easier for
[243.60 - 246.16] him to form a habit
[245.36 - 249.52] now
[246.16 - 252.52] so that it is it's in his lifestyle
[249.52 - 252.52] okay
[274.56 - 276.64] you
