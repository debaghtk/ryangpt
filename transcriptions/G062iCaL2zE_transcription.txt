Transcript: is there a requirement to have a trainer or not have a trainer I primarily feel people don't know how to go about things why do I need a trainer people in India don't help they think that you should be like them they'll say h sir food is the most abused anti-depressant and exercise is the least utilized one after the age of 60 every year we lose about 800 to 900 G of muscle mass if you take at least 60 G of a day it stops this muscle mass loss Dr Kip Singh will reveal his secrets to maintaining a chisel physique at 60 through cycling and strength training let's discover how he manages to eat healthy amidst of his busy schedule as a practicing doctor so sit back and enjoy the episode [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi doctor good evening how are you doing today hi Ryan I'm doing fine thank you was a very generous introduction let's talk about you first um in your school days how are you as a teenager sporty kid are there any rules that you made at that time that are still there with you see I was a very lean thin kid you know those days parents biggest problem was child doesn't put on weight and I was in a school where to play All Sports was compl you were punished if you didn't play oh and therefore we got into playing all sports like from baseball to basketball to football to hockey to Cricket so that was a very good three years 9th 10th 11th which I got and I think that stood with me throughout amazing and when you went into medical college did you have time as a medical student for doing your Fitness because everyone says when once you get into medical studies there's no time to do anything else yeah so first year I would play All Sports and then everybody said if you keep playing you can't study so I thought uh I should focus on exercise because one of my seniors he was a wrestler so I asked him give me tips how to build muscle how to get a good body and he said you actually have to have one L of milk and one kg of banana mangoes every day extra wow so I continued this for a month and exercise like mad and actually lost weight I said no this is not working for me but I think that got it in the head that you know you have to do that okay and um in terms of being a doctor and pushing your body and having lost weight and all over the years I know that you have you know you are a very very Fitness conscious person um did you have a trainer with you or my question to you would be how important is it for people to have a trainer you being a doctor how important is your guidance to the people out there that is there a requirement to have a trainer or not have a trainer yeah most people you will see they say why do I need a trainer I can exercise alone so that is not the issue one number one is the trainer corrects you he corrects your posture he remembers he takes a note last time what did you do today what you have to do so he maintains the schedule secondly he helps you especially in your last reps when you're tired you can drop the dumble or you can drop the barbell he's there to help you thirdly he makes sure you finish your workout and that is important because many times you know I'm in a hurry and I want to shortcut something and just do a little and run away no he will not but most importantly he will make sure that you follow a schedule and that is important speaking of shortcuts doctor which a lot of people who come to my nutrition clinic and you know they want to do a shortcut diet shortcut workout we're seeing a lot of injuries in gyms or death in gyms and I think the trainers help modulate this what is your advice as a doctor to people saying like don't go to the gym don't do aggressive workouts don't do all of these things about the uh how to go to a gym number one is that if I know that I have medical problems then I should consult my physician first and see what can I do what are my limits but what happens is most of the people don't know how to go about it like today cardio is most of the program that is just a warm up you cannot do cardio for 1 hour so 10 minutes of cardio warm up and then you go on to strengthening exercises resistance exercises so most of people don't think because they're they're just doing what they've heard or see other people do secondly there are two types of trainers one is the younger ones who just you know bodybuilding and very young they think that you should be like them they'll say ha sir whereas then you have the other group which is mature which is like 40 plus they say Sir hold do slow you don't need to do more weights you do it carefully you do it slowly and I have a trainer fortunately who used to dealing with older people he restrains you he controls you he makes you do things slower he makes sure the technique is right he says weights will come don't worry but you get your Technique right your position right and your schedule right and that is what is important so Dr Kip is saying go slow even his trainers who are older say go slow correct rep range correct rep timing so I think the most important thing that people who are now hearing about Fitness a medical doctor is also advising that working out is good it's not injurious to your health go slow and steady and so that really helps you know I also studied in a medical college and you studied many years ago you look like a handsome young 40-year-old doctor but I remember when I studied in Med College in 1995 96 that nobody used the premises of the gym or the the what we called is the gymnasium those days it was empty right it was the support staff that you would use it at Goa Medical College what's your advice to medical students today in the fastpac mbbs degree if if you were there teaching them what would you advise them in seven days of a week when should they go what should they do and how quickly can they do a workout see I think uh some exercise should be done daily and that should not be in a gym necessarily so and three days a week at least you should work out and uh so the remaining three days you can just do brisk walking I'm okay with that 30 minutes of brisk walking is good the day you're not going to exercise in the gym the three days you go to a gym 10 minutes of warmup and then you do whatever exercise you do you so I had a trainer I'll tell you this when I started this was about 15 years ago who said sir every day your warm-up will be after cardio two sets of push-ups and two sets of squats okay so I have been doing two sets of push-ups for the last 15 years as my warm up every time I go to the gym and you know it opens up all your muscles and it is a good warm-up actually I spend more time in warmup and stretching than the actual exercise and as you get older that is important because what you have to do is injury-free exercise and that is important so warmup and relaxation later stretching are as important if not more doctor cuep you have inspired me because when I met you I had an ACL tear I'm 49 years old you know Dr cuep you have inspired me because when I met you I had an ACL tear I'm 49 years years 48 years old uh going on to 49 and you know when I met you you was like look at me I cycle I do so many kilometers more than 100 kilometers a week and you said I've had both my knees replaced and that was an inspiration because you continuing to exercise after having an injury and then getting it replaced so what's the what's the voice in your head what's the secret that's pushing you because you motivated me so how can we motivate people out there who are getting older 30 to 40 40 to 50 50 to 60 or even 60 plus 70 plus even if the body is hurting or injured you is a medical doctor who does surgery who replaces things in people uh why should we push the human body they say that food is the most abused anti-depressant and exercise is the least utilized one wow and that is because the relaxation and happiness and stress busting which exercise can get you nothing can parallel and it is one hour where I don't remember anything what I have to do whether my patients are there I finished my work for the day you take your phone into the gym uh I take my phone but it is lying in one corner and my trainer asked me sir should I bring it to you I said only if it says from the hospital otherwise just leave it but we have installed uh a direct line into the gym because I said if somebody has even a fainting spell you need to have something and that is another reason why you should have a trainer you are alone okay you have a fainting spell or God forbid if you have an epileptic have a seizure or maybe have an heart attack anybody can have there should be somebody who can call uh the emergency Cod blue in our hospital so or in the gym so you are actually a doctor working out in the gym in his own Hospital yes yes so what we did was that during covid there was time but we couldn't go to gy gyms were closed okay so we managed to convince our MD to open the a gym in the basement with the biometric access and only one person could go in at a time and sanitize it and my trainer was there with his double mask so so we would do that and uh we installed this phone so that code blue can be called if there is a problem and it is important so I I'll tell you another thing before that somewhere uh before covid uh we do what is called the primary trauma care uh uh training courses in our free time whatever that you may be so uh I got all the trainers from my gym 24 of them from talwalkar gym in Delhi two gyms and we trained them in primary trauma care so my trainer actually doctor for the UN uninitiated what do you mean by primary trauma care primary trauma care is suppose somebody gets an injury and falls down we think people in India don't help but that is not the problem they can't help because they don't know what to do and if you train them in that basic care how to approach the person call out his name make sure he's conscious make sure he's breathing make sure he has a pulse make sure he's and then if not then do a CPR call for help do CPR to resuscitate so this is a very basic thing and we teach it to lay people and I thought my trainers were the persons who should be knowing this and so all our trainers were trained and half the money for that raist the hospital subsidized and half the gym owner subsidized no trainer had to pay money for that but we trained 24 trainers yes that's that's amazing um so talking about trainers and gyms and all um why do you cycle so uh when I had this knee problem first we used to play tennis okay so I had to give up playing tennis and I said I have to exercise so um I got a cycle and uh uh then I said I must start cycling so I started cycling was painless even with the knee problem even with patients with arthritis uh cycling is relatively painless and my Orthopedic Sur allowed it he said it improves gliding and so it is good so I started cycling and then my son joined me and then we would go to longer distance we made Loops one Loop bigger Loop bigger Loop so depending on your mood you would take that Loop okay so that was fun and we had a Midway break and take black coffee and then continue with our cycling so it was fun it was a good substitute for not playing tennis how old was your son when he started cycling with you so he uh I think he was around 28 so it's it's a great way for parents to bond with their kids in an exercise activity absolutely and uh it is good and it is fun and doesn't sound like exercise and uh we would do like a minimum of 20 km that was shortest Loop wow wow yeah so so we would do that yes so you know when we met in Mumbai and we were talking about your life and how you're the doctor that tells everyone to do a diet in the hospital come to me I will tell you what to eat how much protein to take and all and what you shared with me was so remarkable so um any any inspirational stories that you want to share with us as a doctor who works out ask people to work out and then you're also very very uh V iferous about diet being very important for your Fitness regime you know I am a big uh nuisance that way if I see somebody who's not taking care of himself or herself I will point out and uh so what happened we were in one of our meetings and I met this young lady she's a dermatologist from Bangalore and uh I said hey uh do you need advice because I primarily feel people don't know how to go about things do you need to uh help lose weight she said I don't want to talk to you then next day she came to me and said Dr kulp I think I want to talk to you so we discussed this was in August in one year and we went back and then we communicated on WhatsApp uh she said you have spoiled my food I can't have idlies I can't have this I said you slowly modify start with breakfast then we'll do lunch then we'll do dinner and gradually you will feel the energy once your protein intake gets to 60 gam a day you will have enough energy to start exercising so on New Year she sent me a email I talked to her today she said yes you can talk about me happy New Year happy new me wow and she had lost almost 15 kgs and she was working and she said I think I must change my trainer because my weight is not going further down and uh she is 63 now from 80 kgs and continuing this and and she says every time I go cycling I remember you so there are some people who you manage to convince to change their lifestyle and they're looking for it you know they don't know how to go I say there are three things required knowledge resource and motivation three things are required and most of the people don't know these if you can fulfill these three needs uh most of the people will be on track that's that's amazing so uh you know you talked there's a nice point that I wanted to give as a takeaway you didn't tell a person do the whole diet at one shot first start with breakfast so you took one meal you broke down one challenge or one meal got it right then went to the next meal and would you say that you know whenever we advise diet or exercise to people they need to have patience of at least 180 days before they see something yeah because because I tell them see you cannot do it all at once and I what I do is I tell them to First mail me their diet their food diary for 3 days or 5 days I said I want to know how you eat so we can insert things into your food plan without disrupting everything because if I disrupt everything you can't sustain it so they send me the food plan we start with breakfast then lunch then dinner and then we are on to it so gradually and I still tell them every week or two weeks send me progress not about things you've been able to do even things you've not been able to do uh so and it it works and it even works long distance that's true that's very true I work with clients across the world with with the same methodology send me a food diary tell me what you do tell me what you don't do so I think there are some final very cohesive points over here that doing nutrition or doing exercise is no rocket science it's absolutely breaking down basic habits now speaking of habits and speaking of nutrition tell us some of your personal secrets that of the food department that you consume to stay healthy yeah so I always say that uh Indian society when a mother puts food on the table she doesn't think nutrition she thinks taste mhm and I say that if you every time you go for a meal if you say is my food nutritious is my diet balanced half the battle is done true true and and if you can sort out your breakfast I say so I have a protein shake for breakfast mhm and that makes my day because I make it in soy milk soy milk and way protein because till 2:00 I don't feel hungry although at 12 I take a break have some fruit but it is sustaining and that sets my day the tone that yes I have to eat healthy you know what you just said we eat out of love and culture but we don't eat out of science absolutely wonderful so that's that's really good so doctor going fine on the high protein in the morning but a smoothie form having an Apple at 12:00 and getting the first traditional Indian meal maybe around 2:00 in the afternoon I'm presuming by then you've done all your surgeries yeah the surgery is finished even if surgery is not finished I need 10 minutes because my meal is small I'll have either some brown rice grilled chicken and vegetables or I'll have one Roti and uh some uh fish and uh veggies or and a salad so it'll be a very small thing one plate I never take a refill that is my rule doctor I want to ask this question if you have a very long surgery do you come out you fed your food in 5 or 8 minutes and you go back into the surgery yeah because we are many people we work as a team so if it is taking long I'll take a break 10 minutes go to the L have water eat something maybe have a cup of coffee and then come back so so this is this is a guidance to all the corporate people out there who are not saving lives and use this excuse that meeting I have to get my 1 hour lunch break so I'll skip my food I'll change the timing I'll go to the next door daa and eat all the wrong food whereas here is a surgeon who says I still continue my work but I'm eating healthy at the same time and I just need that 8 to 10 minutes to do that eating and go back to my job you know my my staff in the department they all know that I will eat at 2 and they'll tell me Dr Kip 2:00 time for you to eat so that is so good you know even if you don't remember and the day they don't remind me I said boss you are not looking after me you're not reminding me so it a very good thing you know people around you remind you that it's 2:00 and time for you to eat and I tell one thing more to people never bring a whole lunch in one box get your food in small components you get five minutes have salad you get five minutes have one rooty and subzi you get five minutes have fruit you get five minutes you take some uh you know uh bji egg bori or something so unless you want to take the whole meal together you need half an hour which you'll never get but two minutes and you can finish a portion and go back so speaking of portions um you know I've been working with a lot with longivity and fasting and small portion sizes because I was so impressed with your muscular frame and skeletal frame as a 60 plus doctor what's your take on the muscular part and longevity or muscles and Longevity yeah so U longevity is related to lean body mass which is basically our muscle mass and uh there are studies which say that after the age of 60 and even more so after 70 we lose about 800 to 900 gram of muscle mass every year and that affects our quality of life in Walking In climbing stairs in running and if you take at least 60 gam of protein a day it stops this muscle mass loss and improves quality of life so that is one thing if you want your older period in life and now in Indians even younger period because muscle mass is very poor it will improve quality of life and it is directly related to longevity awesome so you're telling the youngsters muscle train you're telling the old people muscle train you're losing muscle add 60 grams of protein in the day doctor your five favorite muscle exercises so like I said my warm-up is always push-up two sets of yeah two sets of 12 push-ups and two sets of squats even now with my replac knees I do that and uh then I go on to uh at least uh one body part three exercises so I try either Chase so if I'm in a hurry I will do my big muscles which are the big muscles so big muscles is back big muscles is chest big muscles thighs so I'll say okay I'll do my thighs and go because today I have less time I'll do this or I'll do my back or I'll do my chest the smaller muscles if you have time you can do that but in a hurry uh do your big muscle uh it metabolizes more calories it increase your BMR more what is your shortest workout you have ever done because you were in Aur today tell today no I had to go I had to go uh um help a colleague's mother I had to do a dressing before I came here okay so I told my trainer that look I went in I I did my warmup I did 10 minutes of cardio I did push-ups I did squats and I said today that is enough see there are three exercises which you can do and exercise your whole body push-ups squats and pull-ups if you can do these three exercises all your body muscles are excise so quickest is two two sets of each after your warm up and then my trainer did five minutes of stretching for me stretching is important you cannot get in exercise get out you know one cardiolog this friend of minded uh he found out that his cholesterol is higher his weight is increasing bought a treadmill he would jump onto the treadmill 30 minutes and then run off he developed such severe fibromyalgia in his back his entire back was stiff it took us six months to get him all right I said you can't mess with exercise so what you're saying is people who suddenly decide to oh I'm going to get fit I'm going to start running suddenly stretch first warm up properly start slow and steady because I think a lot of people are getting motivated by these Instagram videos your podcast my podcast and they suddenly think they're James Bond so I say your mind is stronger than your body you think you can do it but you actually cannot so so what are the tips listen to your body should I check my heart rate like for example a lot of people say no no I don't have time but I'm going to run so I'm going to run for 10 minutes but I don't have time to do 10 minutes of stretch up so when somebody's fat somebody's Plum somebody's a medical profession somebody's in a techie you know everybody says they're so busy busy in today's world and and the person came in front of you what is the exercise regime that you would tell them to do I tell them that I want you to do 30 minutes of brisk walking every day that's all and in that I tell them how to go about it I said if you're in a park first round relaxed you will do it in a park you will wear good shoes you will walk on kacha soil not on a hard track you will do bris so first round is relaxed that is warmup then you increase your speed and at till the speed where you're starting to get breathless then slow down a little that's Rhythm do 5 minutes at fast pace and then one round to relax so start with 5 minutes of brisk walking after a week 10 minutes after a week 15 minutes so you have to reach 30 minutes of brisk walk I don't want you to go go to the gym your body will tell you your nutrition will tell you now I'm ready to exercise in the gym awesome advice doctor for everyone to follow in India start slow and steady in 2024 when you start making a resolution this is the way to start now doctor you are a surgeon you're an aesthetic surgeon plastic surgeon you change people from outside but you're also very passionate about diet you're very passionate about exercise does nutrition affect our gut health and our digestion yes absolutely um uh the uh so I tell them it has to be a balanced right you have to have fiber you have to have green vegetables you know colored vegetables are the key to your vitamin health and then one more thing it is there that uh I always always uh take glutamine in my workout drink glutamine my favorite amino acid yes it is the it is the exclusive food for our gut cells ocytes ocytes do not consume anything else other than glutamine so glutamine is an excellent thing for gut health uh lot of cancer uh medical oncologists use it for their patients it also enhances good recovery of the muscle so glutamine supplementation enough fiber in your diet in enough water see you need water and fiber both to get the gut rolling so that you move the bowel and what people don't do is they don't drink enough water so I think a little bit of exercise to have gravity shake you up uh a little bit of water a little bit of glutamine little bit of fiber uh but doctor you know I as a nutritionist I've been uh telling people in the older days we ate out once a quarter because Daddy got some money and we could go to this Posh Restaurant and then maybe about 10 years ago we ate out once a month about 5 years ago everyone's eating out once a week now everyone's using the click of a button and ordering all of these online Foods I'm sure you see it with the younger doctors in your hospital yes so are you a doctor that promotes a tiffen box carrying order out from these apps from a digestive point of view what's your take so I believe that if you carry your food you will eat it if you're not carrying food you will eat whatever is available and that that may not be healthy so so that is the uh most important thing about food what happens Ryan is that once you start building muscle bulk you feel the need to have enough protein in your food and if you don't get it you get upset we go to parties and there are two three of us like-minded people we are hunting for protein so you have to have enough protein you have to have some carbohydrates you have to have enough greens and salads and you're done so if even if you sometimes have to order order something which contains all of these rather than saying no I'll order some maybe chart or a burger or something order a sandwich order a multigrain sandwich you'll have fish in that uh with salad and is good and uh you can order healthy food but it should be in your mind that I want to eat healthy is it true doctor because I read one study that says when people are the most stressed out or most short of time they're very hangry and they make the worst decisions to order the most unhealthy food at that moment yeah these are people who are not loving their bodies see I said I push my body every day to the extreme why would I now eat unhealthy I mean why am I doing all this if I'm not going to feed it so I feed my body I feed my muscles I feed my health so if Dr kulp was a vehicle or a car he'd be a Rolls-Royce and he would be telling everyone my body is the most expensive real estate I own I live in it as a landlord I don't live in it as a tenant would you say that's true Dr K AB absolutely I own it you own it and now speaking of internal beauty and stuff like that we talked about nutrition exercise now you're a doctor which who makes people beautiful also from a skin perspective uh nutrition and exercise how will it help from prevention acne point of you wrinkles growing older or how do I get more clear and radiant skin I remember when I met you in Mumbai for the aesthetic conference that I automatically assumed you were in your 40s your skin was glowing it had that it had that glow to it so what's your secrets to adding food in your diet so um I think what you have to do is have enough vitamins have enough antioxidants there is so much of free radicals being generated everywhere uh environment by the Sun and so many things that if you have enough antioxidants you will do well so uh like I was talking I I consume uh one gr one gram of that amla extract vitamin C every day so for dinner when I sit down in my water I add one and I have that with my food so I'm doing that vitamin C is a brilliant antioxidant it is also a very strong immune booster it is a depigment it is something which is you know helps in almost every part of your body and that is one thing which has been with me and I always make sure there are enough col colored vegetables in my food and that helps your skin I tell my patients nail is pure protein you need protein for the hair you need protein for the blood you need protein for the bone you need protein for muscle for everything hemoglobin is half globin and half H iron and protein so you have to make sure now since covid people have become more sensitive I do their nutritional profile when they come to me if there is hairfall if they have bad skin if they have acne I said you you have to at least know that your nutrition is adequate and they're surprised sometimes they fall see everything ha wire and then we sort that out slowly and they get into a better regimen of diet skin care nutrition exercise Dr Kip is wonderful talking to you today you know as a medical doctor surgeon expert any fascinating study that you have come across that will motivate millions of Indians which when you get your private clients coming to you and you're telling them correct your exercise correct your dat is there any fascinating study that you would like to share with our listeners yes so so there was a study published in the American Journal of nutrition and this was a systematic review of 50 studies and they had compared a high carb low protein diet to a low carb high protein diet and there were three distinct advantages which all studies agreed on one is eating more protein is thermogenic you need more calories to burn protein so if you just change your diet don't change your lifestyle at all you will will probably burn uh lose about 1.5 kgs per year just by changing your food second is it provide Sati third is it promotes selective fat loss so these were three conclusions of the systematic review uh published in the American General Nutrition and that has stuck with me it is such good satiety carbs the more you carbs you eat the more carbs you want to eat again because hunger is sustained rather than satiated so would you also say that fasting is part of your G not fasting I I I don't really fast if I think I have eaten enough in the evening sometimes evening I come and snack then I skip my dinner and I just have a protein shake uh and go to sleep awesome and uh yeah that is good because then I balance out everything one thing I want to tell you we have a doctor's lounge and every day or every alternate day some of the other consultant is giving lunches you know daughter is got married we have a grandchild so what did I do I got 250 bottles of milk protein shakes so I said this is lactose free this is no sugar and you will drink this and uh this will you know you will at least get a taste of what a protein Che you have very bad impressions of how protein tastes so doctor you know we talk about the skin and we talk about health and we talk about exercising and workout and you start breathing heavily and all now speaking of breathing situation it's really polluted uh schools are closing down and we're hearing doctors talking about the risk elements to health to the skin to the immunity system to the liver to the lungs what is it that a person can do to biohack their body so um when I first started cycling uh even in times when the uh pollution is less I've always used an n95 mask sorry even before Co used to use it yeah for the last 15 years so that means people who work out in cities they're taking in all of this smoke and pollution and they think they're getting fitter but they're also putting in a lot of smoke yeah but what convince what convinced you to use an n95 mask before what was the thought process as a doctor n95 masks are primarily anti-pollution masks we have used them for covid later ah so so they are anti-pollution masks it is written there it is an anti-pollution mask and uh what I happened was when I in the evening when I come back I blow my nose I could see uh dust I mean uh the what secretions come they are uh contaminated with dirt you'll be surprised I used to go cycling and I wear white masks so the outside would be turned dark blackish and the inside would be absolutely white and when I blew my nose after coming back from cycling it was absolutely clean so that encouraged me and it was like a sort of hypoxic training because there's a part on Nelson Mandela Road where it is uphill and for 3 kilomet so that was a good exercise and I used to keep my mask on so in Co actually it conditioned me I didn't have any problem wearing a mask all the time you know James Nest has written a latest book called breath uh and he's a journalist that interviewed pulmon pulmonologists across the world and the latest information from deep sea divers to highend athletes is that the same intensity of breathing uh is better when you breathe only in through your nose and out through your nose and what you mentioned more carbon dioxide allows for lesser hyperventilation and lesser effort to an exercise but you know people in Delhi are smoking 25 30 cigarettes a day as per a Times of India article yeah so we don't see the pollution is your advice to people to try and wear a mask during the season of high pollution yeah so what what I did Ryan was I bought a sensor uh which uh senses uh BM 2.5 okay and uh I took it to my workplace in my room in the lobby in my car in my study in my drawing room and outside okay and then I could place which place is clean and which place I need to wear a mask so my hospital is clean the theaters actually have the lowest PM 2.5 is like 910 because they have hea filters all over uh my rooms are also clean uh air conditioning also to a certain extent brings down uh the pollution level especially uh Central air conditioning which is not getting in direct air from the outside the big cars all have hipa filters and I could have 40 inside my car and 400 outside the PM 2.5 the smaller cars don't have HEPA filters so my daughter's car we put a Philips car small portable portable filter into the car in 5 minutes it makes the PM 2.5 go to 40 wow wow so everywhere once I know where pollution is more and where it is less then I say only when I'm outdoors I will wear a mask very intellectual and very fantle question uh or utopian question if you were the health minister of India what would you change for this pollution thing so I tweeted one day to to the environment Ministry to the chief minister of Delhi I said the best thing we have seen for pollution is if you have weekly rain you know it was raining for some time this year we had the longest low pollution period this time in this year before this pollution started again and that was because almost every week we would have rainfall it washes everything down aqi is down and we are good so the I said the best thing is seed clouds have rain every week for these two months and you're done so I think that is the easiest they've been only cribbing they've not been doing anything the measures are all half measures so we should end on a less chokey note and a more happy note what about sleep doctor how many hours do you sleep what do you recommend to your patients your clients and uh uh e is there anything in the Sleep Department that you take from improving your sleep is there any biohacking or any nutrition that you do so um workout drinks mostly contain caffeine yes so if you are doing evening exercise take yeah you have to be careful or you get uh low caffeine medium caffeine high caffeine pre-workout drinks or make it half a scoop or drink only little or remove it entirely from your but you have to be careful or like me if you sleep like at midnight see I my my mental faculty is more active at night if I have to do written work I do that but I sleep definitely by 12:00 and I get up at 6:45 or 7 so 7 hours of sleep I get every day and surprisingly from the time I started working out I can sleep like this your body demands sleep s so exercise is the best sedative work out and you sleep like a baby so so doctor we'll end this episode with if senior Dr kulp had to travel back in time and meet Junior kulp what would you tell him differently so uh yeah I will tell you about this one of my colleagues son he was going to engineering college and he was quite thin and he said Uncle I want to build some muscle so I said okay you're going to boarding I mean it is hostel what can you eat what protein can you get can you get eggs he said yeah I can get eggs I said okay so One Source done second you can take we protein with you and otherwise everything else is a bonus every day you will eat four egg whites one whole egg three whites and one scoop of a protein anytime you get you drink milk you can drink with that so we gave him resource and he's a lazy person he would go to the gym only 3 days a week and he would do only eight reps per set and when he came back after 5 years because this 18 to 20 period now you know what do you need three things to build muscle which I didn't know then you need nutrition you need exercise and you need testosterone and an 18-year-old has an abundance of testosterone it is so easy to build muscle I didn't know it then nor did we have resources now if I would go I would be like a hunk in medical school you are you are a hunk in a lot of people's eyes Dr Kip thank you so much for being part of heal shots podcast with Ryan Fernando may God grant you a very long life uh hope you're lifting into your 90s and um I'll join
