[0.08 - 4.48] coffee has one of the highest amount of
[2.52 - 6.68] antioxidants on the planet so I don't
[4.48 - 9.12] recommend too many cups of coffee but
[6.68 - 11.28] one to two cups of coffee in the day can
[9.12 - 12.84] help an individual get not only the
[11.28 - 15.52] caffeine which stimulates the brain but
[12.84 - 17.56] just the antioxidants and my all-time
[15.52 - 20.52] favorite is dark chocolate in the exam
[17.56 - 23.44] season I would tell every kid have hot
[20.52 - 25.24] cocoa before you study don't eat a
[23.44 - 26.48] chocolate bar because of the sugar in it
[25.24 - 28.20] which is going and cancel out the
[26.48 - 30.16] benefits but I'm talking about dark
[28.20 - 31.72] chocolate put it in a hot chocolate mix
[30.16 - 33.00] that's got a lot of sugar also right no
[31.72 - 34.32] you put a lot of sugar because you had
[33.00 - 37.12] sugar so when you do your drinking
[34.32 - 39.24] chocolate it's loaded with 55 60% sugar
[37.12 - 41.16] so you've got a train people you got to
[39.24 - 43.76] train your palette not to take so much
[41.16 - 43.76] of sugar
