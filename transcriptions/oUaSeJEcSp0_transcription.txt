Title: 1 solution for DIABETES

Description: Including daal (lentils) in the diet can be beneficial for individuals with diabetes. Daal is a rich source of complex carbohydrates and fiber, which contribute to stable blood sugar levels. The low glycemic index of lentils helps prevent rapid spikes in blood glucose after meals. Additionally, daal provides a good amount of protein, which is essential for overall health and blood sugar management. The soluble fiber in lentils slows down digestion and absorption, promoting better glucose control. It's important to pair daal with other nutritious foods and maintain a well-balanced diet, along with regular exercise, for effective diabetes management. Always consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice based on individual health conditions.
