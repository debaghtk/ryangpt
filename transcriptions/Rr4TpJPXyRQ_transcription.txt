Nutrition holds the power to heal you. The right nutrition strategy can speed up recovery.



***********************************************************************************
Recovering quickly from the injuries while avoiding major fitness loss is a common goal among athletes. Nutrition often is overlooked in the recovery process.

The human body is made to heal itself. When injured, the molecules inside the body kickstart the recovery process. During this phase, the body requires a lot of energy. So if the nutrition is not right and the body is not getting the required calories it will hinder the recovery process and prolongs the duration for which athlete need to be out of action on the sidelines.

Including anti-inflammatory foods and avoiding pro-inflammatory foods in the diet is critical for faster recovery. Inflammation is the bodyâ€™s protective response to injury and facilitates the repair process. But too much inflammation can hinder the healing process.

Along with the right foods, the right supplement strategy can help speed up the healing process. The dosage and timing of the supplements are very critical for proper recovery. Self-prescribed supplement dosages can have detrimental effects and will aggravate the problem further.

No one diet fits all. Injury specific nutrition interventions based on individual needs will only be able to deliver the desired results.

Transcript: at the end of I love you thank you hi my name is Maya and I'm the chief nutritionist you just saw one of my athletes talk about recovering from his dementia in 25 days which we predicted a vs. is doctor predicting us 60 days recovering now in an athlete's is very important quicker you recover the faster you come back the better is your recovery the least is the amount of scar tissue formation this is almost possible from my spectrum of rehabilitation which is the nutrition head and it's divided into diet and the violence often and so how do you keep preview on what is on budget and by the way I'm not going to give you specific dosages because do is not for free advice this video is to convince physios orthopedic surgeons doctors many people helping athletes who have just gotten injured to guide them in the direction of please get your tie please get your supplementation done on the way to the hospital whites are getting an x-ray done so let's understand how we can take this forward the number one protein in your ligament cartilage and you're born is collagen and it's raw material will come from mostly gelatin now research says that when you enhance gelatin intake all quality negative growth and strength can be improved now it can be this in the face of growing technologies or it could be the case of an injured active again injury born tissue ligaments cartilage all of these can we heal quicker and faster if you give the property so there was in search where they found that the collagen content in the desired place of injury was actually increased when it's supplemented with gelatin so in my mind there's a cheap nutritional to keep hey hang on collagen or gelatin that's number one second thing an ancient Indian hope in either the the name is called sis's quadrangle Asst and this in research has shown to reduce the fraction recovery to four weeks instead of six weeks so whenever wherever the ancestors quadratus there's a specific ghost known on we get the dose to you because this is your body weight it's based on your gender basically come to us at quarks and we tell you how to use this is quadratus for me vocal cometh free advice view it's a lot of purple cabbage when you get and eg because it contains anthocyanins and research has shown that it increases the endothelial nitric oxide synthase simply with nitric oxide productions of the greater vasodilation greater circulation so more proliferation is happening at the job at the aid of eg and it's a human vascular cell migration if you're gonna understand science and your simple kapadia above an ethical human basket vascular muffler the the circulation system so cell migration new cells have to go at the point of Mg and replicate of building bridges of building big faces so that's very important with popping garbage now in your muscular skeletal system you have born because you deserve in the bone you could get injured in the ligaments you could get injured in the cartilage all of these okay if we take comprise of what I talked about collagen but let's have an in-depth view of the bones but only is around eighty percent which is compact and 20% which is spongy now you have millions of protein in your water in bones but cheaply I will point this out to you collagen is a key guy looking at so if you see over here 22% is protein and the remaining 70% is the Middle's so people forget to add the protein and the members are human and windows 29% this caption and every 33 percent is constant you have to make sure that this is dynamically given and the biggest problem over here is that when kids get injured they feel they can do chips and pizza and ice cream because the injure and they don't need to further the diet because they're not in training this is far from the truth in fact during injury time remember this you have to save your body from putting on weight you exercise you burn calories when you injured you don't exercise because we're not exercising you're going to have the same appetite eating quantities that you are eating when you are exercising so we gain happens you put more load on the body become party Goomba rocky you're not recovering from your injury faster and you're putting a greater stress burden on your body when you come back from the heel so put forth our by the way in governments and in tendons the number one criteria of raw material is 95 percent in tendons and about 90 percent in we have collagen by one so for me if I remember the first one I need collagen on how delicate my body breaks it up with some wine acids and then basically produces the payments on me so how the collagen will be when I kind of all together and this makes the stuff so sub-sub and then goes to build the fibers point is get to the raw material when you have in gd7 now energy you start with a broken part leaving information on is not to be external meaning but the phase the phase that we want to go through is in inflammatory this is where most of your damage is beginning to happen the body starts recovering proliferation is when you start adding raw materials and everything and this whole thing can take anywhere from it is to maybe up to three four five months and it varies from different different structures in human body whatever to you is that your inflammatory phase sorry your inflammatory phase is about six days very important omega-3 having curcumin based foods which are anti-inflammatory really reduce inflammation down so your proof proliferation can start faster if your proliferation starts faster this is where you keep all your raw material so that the tissue remodeling instead of 60 days which a doctor will say or take about two months let's bring it down to 25 days so we have been we have been able to bring back athletes faster and if you see in the inflammation phase if I can get collagen coming in faster by reducing my information then I can get to metrication much faster lots of technically simple thing you break something you need raw material you need to know which raw material you know how much of that raw material give it to your body and when to give that raw material such that you rebuild whatever structure is there inside you faster will come that down I've had quite a few people they haven't talked about it but let me tell you Boca Chica the again he was told eight weeks to come back we got him back in the nutrition you know again and so we quickly and raucous a massive broke his neck just because of the vitamin D deficiency so the moment you break one of the things you can do immediately so there are three parts one eat well so that your body is much stronger look at it stronger connective tissue look at stronger bones there's a gene test you can do which will look for preventive point of view whether you are Co l5 a1 gene works well or not in terms of absorbing and you seal collagen better if the genius law is a new treatment with will supplement in your diet more quantity of one rocks of in fact if the gene is knowing your non-vegetarian I mean ask you to take a non-veg photo the reason being is and wanting to protect yourself against it the second point if you get injured how quickly should you pick up the phone well in my opinion you are if you're ever injured you have to contact us on the way to the x-ray when you're in the ambulance very very important you get a great one handsome tear you contact me all to buy this do this do this do this then you start immediately even before you get your MRI done you already have that because in Chile healing is dynamic and the last and third point your shelf life and athlete the third point your shelf life and an athlete is dependent on reducing injury the vectors of nutrition the longer your shelf like the nests of the injury my name is Ryan Fernando I walk on interview habilitation programs across the world a six-month plan would be on an injured athlete we just probably saved a couple so please don't touch
