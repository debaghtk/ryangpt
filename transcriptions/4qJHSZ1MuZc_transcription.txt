Title: Psyllium Husk - Explained by @DrPal   #beprohealth #podcast #nutritionguide #nutritionfacts

Description: Psyllium husk, derived from the seeds of the Plantago ovata plant, is a soluble fiber renowned for its health benefits. Often used as a dietary supplement, psyllium husk aids in digestion by absorbing water in the gut, forming a gel-like substance that promotes regular bowel movements. It is commonly used to relieve constipation, improve bowel regularity, and support overall digestive health. Additionally, psyllium husk may help lower cholesterol levels and regulate blood sugar levels. However, it's important to consume an adequate amount of water when taking psyllium husk to prevent potential digestive issues.

[0.04 - 4.52] cium husk is a wonderful option we also
[2.52 - 6.44] give it to all my patients in us as well
[4.52 - 8.32] it comes with a brand called matam musil
[6.44 - 10.16] idea behind that is as we talked about
[8.32 - 11.88] fiber is absolutely critical for the gut
[10.16 - 13.44] in our modern days era we don't get
[11.88 - 15.40] enough fiber so we add this fiber
[13.44 - 17.48] supplements but the problem is we need
[15.40 - 19.48] to add it very slowly because all the
[17.48 - 21.56] gut all the people's every individual is
[19.48 - 24.32] different so sometimes fiber can
[21.56 - 26.12] precipitate abdominal bloating so most
[24.32 - 27.76] of the times what happens is I take as
[26.12 - 29.32] them to take celium husk they take one
[27.76 - 30.56] day and then they get bloated and they
[29.32 - 32.00] like you know this do is not good let's
[30.56 - 34.16] go to a different doctor so you should
[32.00 - 35.80] talk very very slowly sometimes you
[34.16 - 37.56] might be able to even take two to three
[35.80 - 39.28] capsules that you'll be surprised
[37.56 - 42.04] sometimes you'll be able to eat only one
[39.28 - 43.96] or even better is forget about celium
[42.04 - 46.00] mask and just take fiber through natural
[43.96 - 48.72] sources until you reach 25 G of fiber
[46.00 - 48.72] per day minimum
