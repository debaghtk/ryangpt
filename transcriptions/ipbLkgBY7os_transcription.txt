[139.84 - 144.20] um first of all thank you so much Ryan
[141.56 - 147.52] for having me in this podcast let me
[144.20 - 150.24] take you back a couple of years when I
[147.52 - 153.44] was in school I actually grew up in an
[150.24 - 156.76] entirely different country and the food
[153.44 - 159.68] that was available there the vegetables
[156.76 - 163.32] they were all imported so even if I was
[159.68 - 165.00] eating a well balanced diet back then
[163.32 - 167.96] comparatively better than most of my
[165.00 - 169.60] friends in fact I was in fact known as
[167.96 - 172.44] one of the people who used to be very
[169.60 - 175.20] health conscious even then and after my
[172.44 - 178.08] school was done I came to India I
[175.20 - 180.48] studied in nit TR my entire body
[178.08 - 182.52] completely shifted I started to see a
[180.48 - 184.44] lot of changes within my body itself I
[182.52 - 186.00] started to develop dust allergy when I
[184.44 - 188.92] did not even have that in the first
[186.00 - 192.04] place sinusitis I started developing
[188.92 - 195.40] stomach ulcers every 6 months that I had
[192.04 - 197.64] to be hospitalized I had to take drips
[195.40 - 200.68] bottles of drips every six months and
[197.64 - 202.28] that that bad it was that bad could it
[200.68 - 204.80] be could it have been the food that you
[202.28 - 207.16] were eating at the hostels where you
[204.80 - 208.88] were studying one could definitely be
[207.16 - 210.68] that food could have been something
[208.88 - 215.00] another Factor could be the way that my
[210.68 - 217.92] gut microbiome itself was earlier versus
[215.00 - 222.28] now I may not have been resistant to
[217.92 - 223.84] certain foods which certain Indians were
[222.28 - 225.56] building that resistance as they were
[223.84 - 228.08] living in this country so because of
[225.56 - 230.04] that shift my body just could not take
[228.08 - 232.68] that so what so what did you do then
[230.04 - 235.04] from that discovery of not being well in
[232.68 - 236.16] the gut and falling sick all the time at
[235.04 - 237.60] that point I could not really do
[236.16 - 239.56] anything I was not able to understand
[237.60 - 241.84] how to figure this out I was going to
[239.56 - 244.76] the hospital every 6 months and I was
[241.84 - 247.04] also having my NCC routine where I was
[244.76 - 248.68] fit as well so I was having a good
[247.04 - 250.48] enough body I was having a good enough
[248.68 - 252.96] diet but still there were several
[250.48 - 255.92] factors which were holding me back
[252.96 - 258.96] healthwise I was not understanding as to
[255.92 - 261.48] what more could I possibly do to make my
[258.96 - 264.08] health better so that is where it truly
[261.48 - 266.96] started after those four years I came
[264.08 - 269.04] into Bangalore and the story continued I
[266.96 - 270.72] thought having better quality of food me
[269.04 - 272.96] controlling the ingredients that I was
[270.72 - 275.52] having would make the situation better
[272.96 - 277.92] but it truly did not that is when I
[275.52 - 279.24] started to reflect back looking how old
[277.92 - 283.92] were you when you when this was
[279.24 - 286.80] happening um I was 18 19 20 and when I
[283.92 - 291.76] came to Bangalore I was 21 years old so
[286.80 - 294.52] this is when 21 was the start of when I
[291.76 - 296.40] truly realized that it was not just the
[294.52 - 299.04] food that I was eating but it was the
[296.40 - 301.16] way I was eating as well was there any
[299.04 - 303.28] one point in those years when you were
[301.16 - 305.80] doing chemical engineering is what you
[303.28 - 308.00] said yeah so when you were like studying
[305.80 - 309.72] chemistry and engineering and all of
[308.00 - 311.16] that stuff obviously to get into
[309.72 - 313.52] engineering means you're very smart in
[311.16 - 315.84] the head so there must have been a smart
[313.52 - 318.20] brain Point saying that I need to do
[315.84 - 320.56] something about this was it in the first
[318.20 - 322.80] year second year third year did you
[320.56 - 325.44] watch a video or did your mother say
[322.80 - 327.52] something to you could it was it one
[325.44 - 330.96] specific point or it was happened over a
[327.52 - 335.32] period of time okay um I think it was
[330.96 - 337.96] those every 6 months I had some sort of
[335.32 - 340.76] a realization that there was something
[337.96 - 343.44] definitely going wrong right but it was
[340.76 - 345.44] it still took me a lot of years to
[343.44 - 347.08] really pinpoint as to what I was doing
[345.44 - 348.84] wrong it was not one thing that I was
[347.08 - 351.32] doing wrong it was multiple things that
[348.84 - 353.68] I was doing wrong on a constant basis I
[351.32 - 356.04] was not happy with the way that I
[353.68 - 359.00] generally was I was having so much
[356.04 - 361.24] stress for absolutely no reason at all
[359.00 - 363.88] and that was causing a lot of the issues
[361.24 - 365.88] that I was having inside I was so
[363.88 - 367.60] stressed that the food that I was eating
[365.88 - 370.56] was just not doing me any sort of
[367.60 - 372.36] service as well the stress of Performing
[370.56 - 374.52] well in those four years especially when
[372.36 - 376.12] it is a Government College it's very
[374.52 - 378.16] competitive you have these certain
[376.12 - 380.48] standards you need to meet you need to
[378.16 - 382.44] be on top of the class at all points of
[380.48 - 386.24] time you need to get the right kind of
[382.44 - 389.24] job so it was several things which sort
[386.24 - 391.32] of contributed to this which took me a
[389.24 - 394.60] lot of maturity and it did take me a lot
[391.32 - 397.64] of years to understand so when you
[394.60 - 399.36] finished and you came out you knew you
[397.64 - 402.00] were going to go in the direction of
[399.36 - 405.08] Health and Wellness or it was still
[402.00 - 408.92] unknown at that point I would say that
[405.08 - 410.80] from college I was very well aware that
[408.92 - 412.40] Health Fitness and Wellness was
[410.80 - 415.36] something that was very
[412.40 - 418.36] integral however I did not deep dive
[415.36 - 421.24] deep as much as I did until a couple of
[418.36 - 423.80] years ago it was more of me just
[421.24 - 425.60] reflecting back on my body I started to
[423.80 - 428.08] do all sorts of diets you would not even
[425.60 - 429.76] believe I went on this water diet for 4
[428.08 - 432.20] days where I did not drink water because
[429.76 - 434.16] people said it will detox your body from
[432.20 - 436.32] inside and you will have Clarity of Mind
[434.16 - 438.76] thoughts any stomach related issues
[436.32 - 440.68] would also get cleared I presume you
[438.76 - 442.48] went through a nightmare of a period by
[440.68 - 444.80] the end of that it was absolutely
[442.48 - 447.36] horrible I would stare at swiggy and
[444.80 - 449.00] just look at Dal Mak and be like oh man
[447.36 - 451.36] when is the time when I will get that
[449.00 - 454.32] Marcel of food into my mouth and
[451.36 - 456.68] eventually I just once that was done I
[454.32 - 458.48] did not go back to doing all these so
[456.68 - 459.96] you you work with thousands of people
[458.48 - 461.88] and you guide them from the Mind
[459.96 - 464.00] perspective and all so from your
[461.88 - 466.64] personal learning uh you would not
[464.00 - 468.64] recommend anyone to do a nonwater fast
[466.64 - 471.36] right with without water fast go with
[468.64 - 473.16] nothing am I right yeah it does not make
[471.36 - 476.24] sense I mean at the end of the day your
[473.16 - 479.12] body itself naturally detoxifies itself
[476.24 - 481.88] from within all we need to do is Aid
[479.12 - 483.72] that how do we help our body do that
[481.88 - 485.24] better that is what we need to really
[483.72 - 487.04] look at going on these fasts where you
[485.24 - 489.12] only drink water for a couple of days
[487.04 - 491.08] only go on these raw vegan diets I'm not
[489.12 - 493.24] saying these diets are wrong do it in
[491.08 - 495.60] the right way do it balanced such that
[493.24 - 498.76] it's actually nourishing you from inside
[495.60 - 501.00] my mental health went to an absolute
[498.76 - 502.48] Downer during those 4 days I was so
[501.00 - 504.08] miserable but that is not how it's
[502.48 - 507.28] supposed to be right you shouldn't your
[504.08 - 509.96] answer should not be an extreme solution
[507.28 - 512.72] your answer should be a balance and that
[509.96 - 515.64] is what needs to wise words very wise
[512.72 - 518.16] words you know I genuinely believe that
[515.64 - 519.72] people try fasting research has shown
[518.16 - 522.68] that 30 hours of fasting actually
[519.72 - 525.68] rejuvenate the body but people don't do
[522.68 - 528.00] it right and the the word right equals
[525.68 - 529.16] scientific every body is different and
[528.00 - 531.88] you know you have to change it
[529.16 - 533.80] accordingly now speaking of you doing
[531.88 - 536.92] these different diets and
[533.80 - 540.52] all what's your normal daily routine
[536.92 - 543.64] like as a wellness coach he health coach
[540.52 - 546.72] a practitioner of yoga a teacher of yoga
[543.64 - 548.64] what's your normal day like all right so
[546.72 - 550.40] when I wake up in the morning it is
[548.64 - 553.88] usually at about
[550.40 - 556.44] 6:30 and at that time I'm not joking you
[553.88 - 560.28] will have the absolute best poop of your
[556.44 - 563.72] life because your body at that time is
[560.28 - 566.00] ready to detoxify that time between 4:
[563.72 - 567.32] to 6:00 a.m. is one of the best times to
[566.00 - 570.52] actually go and take a dump in the
[567.32 - 573.12] bathroom so you will see the poop that
[570.52 - 575.48] comes out is actually very free flowing
[573.12 - 577.92] and you it's completely flushed out from
[575.48 - 580.56] your body so that time is the time when
[577.92 - 582.64] I usually wake up complete my business
[580.56 - 584.44] in the bathroom and post that I
[582.64 - 586.56] immediately take my yoga mat to the
[584.44 - 588.88] Terrace don't do anything I don't even
[586.56 - 590.48] take my phone for the first one or two
[588.88 - 592.04] hours in my day when I wake up that is
[590.48 - 594.28] something that I've kept very strictly
[592.04 - 596.96] for myself I don't want any sort of
[594.28 - 600.00] distractions as a meditation
[596.96 - 601.92] person why do you advise people
[600.00 - 604.20] not to touch their phone first thing in
[601.92 - 605.68] the morning as soon as you wake up the
[604.20 - 607.36] first thing that you see sort of sets
[605.68 - 610.40] the intention for the rest of the day
[607.36 - 613.44] sets the intention yes so your intention
[610.40 - 617.08] is to do yoga and meditation what sort
[613.44 - 619.68] of intention comes out of that okay when
[617.08 - 622.64] I go up and sit for pranayam what is
[619.68 - 625.96] pranayam pranayam is the art of
[622.64 - 630.28] regulation of breath that you do on your
[625.96 - 633.28] own to improve your state of being now
[630.28 - 636.40] Prana itself pranayama is broken into
[633.28 - 639.52] two parts one is Prana Prana means the
[636.40 - 643.52] life force energy and iama is the
[639.52 - 646.56] regulation of it so we practice these
[643.52 - 649.28] breathing techniques which will give us
[646.56 - 651.28] certain kinds of results so for example
[649.28 - 653.40] if you are someone who are who is in
[651.28 - 655.48] general feels very cold during the
[653.40 - 657.52] winter there are certain pranama
[655.48 - 660.08] techniques which you can practice to
[657.52 - 662.04] build up that heat from inside so there
[660.08 - 663.68] was one uh time when I was actually
[662.04 - 665.40] riding the scoty in Bangalore and I was
[663.68 - 667.36] feeling absolutely cold I was wearing
[665.40 - 668.60] half sleeves like you know I was
[667.36 - 670.84] thinking that you know I can handle it
[668.60 - 672.80] and all of that and I was driving and I
[670.84 - 674.52] was feeling very cold the air just hits
[672.80 - 676.80] your chest right I was sitting and doing
[674.52 - 679.44] pranam while I was driving to build the
[676.80 - 682.04] heat inside of my body and I was fine
[679.44 - 684.08] right so pranayam is so beautiful
[682.04 - 686.72] because it I just thought of I just
[684.08 - 689.52] thought of the Tibetan Monks who sit in
[686.72 - 692.08] the Himalayas and they put these cold
[689.52 - 694.60] blankets in him so I'm thinking of Muna
[692.08 - 696.40] is riding a scooty and you can see you
[694.60 - 698.12] can see steam coming off her body
[696.40 - 699.60] because it's cold in Bangalore and she's
[698.12 - 701.72] like a fog machine going through the
[699.60 - 703.96] city so that's the thing right you see
[701.72 - 705.80] these yogis who have been practicing
[703.96 - 708.04] pran for years and years and years
[705.80 - 710.00] who've dedicated their life to that they
[708.04 - 712.60] are sitting in the Himalayas with just a
[710.00 - 714.64] cloth around their waist and that's it
[712.60 - 716.28] and people wonder and think how is that
[714.64 - 718.20] possible is because they're doing these
[716.28 - 720.24] practices for years and years with the
[718.20 - 722.00] right kind of intention building that
[720.24 - 725.24] kind of immunity from inside you will
[722.00 - 728.28] not believe the benefits of pranayam are
[725.24 - 731.44] absolutely like wonderful it any stress
[728.28 - 733.88] related issue or stress induced uh
[731.44 - 735.64] disease that you might get pranayam
[733.88 - 737.12] completely reverses that or helps you
[735.64 - 739.92] manage that better so so for the
[737.12 - 741.56] unenlightened like me uh we get up in
[739.92 - 743.36] the morning and we rush and take our kid
[741.56 - 744.76] to school obviously it means I have to
[743.36 - 747.96] get up a little bit
[744.76 - 749.68] earlier how fast could I do a pranayama
[747.96 - 751.92] and a yoga technique like you going up
[749.68 - 754.72] to the Terrace and doing it for 1 hour
[751.92 - 757.00] right is it allowed to do it in a
[754.72 - 759.52] shorter duration and if shorter duration
[757.00 - 762.24] how short can I get the benefits of this
[759.52 - 764.28] okay I don't do plan for one I do 20
[762.24 - 765.84] minutes only 20 minutes only 20 minutes
[764.28 - 767.60] what's the shortest you know today we
[765.84 - 768.76] have all of these shorts and one minute
[767.60 - 772.04] videos and
[768.76 - 774.64] all as an expert what's the shortest
[772.04 - 776.88] period that you can practice where we
[774.64 - 779.44] will get some mental and physiological
[776.88 - 782.24] benefit 15 to 20 minutes 15 to 20
[779.44 - 784.00] minutes of just pranay okay I'm not
[782.24 - 785.68] talking about meditation yoga ASAS that
[784.00 - 788.44] is not that so I'm a little confused
[785.68 - 790.44] over here when I think pranayama now I'm
[788.44 - 791.64] thinking oh I'm going to meditate and
[790.44 - 794.48] I'm going to link my thoughts and I'm
[791.64 - 796.64] going to meditate also so pranama just
[794.48 - 798.32] focus on breathing it's only your breath
[796.64 - 800.00] work so right now when you're sitting
[798.32 - 804.24] yeah okay so so can I read the newspaper
[800.00 - 806.72] and do pranayama you cannot actually do
[804.24 - 809.12] that so I need to be emptying my mind at
[806.72 - 810.44] that period technically yeah so I need
[809.12 - 812.08] need to have no distraction that's why
[810.44 - 813.52] you said don't take the phone exactly
[812.08 - 815.84] that is why I do that the first thing in
[813.52 - 818.44] the morning itself so you kind of
[815.84 - 820.24] recalibrating your body first thing in
[818.44 - 821.64] the morning it's like setting fine
[820.24 - 823.60] tuning it first thing in the morning
[821.64 - 826.32] exactly so the thing is right now we are
[823.60 - 827.56] we are living such busy lives and we as
[826.32 - 829.24] soon as we wake up the first things we
[827.56 - 830.88] do is actually check our phone check our
[829.24 - 832.52] notifications like what is our calendar
[830.88 - 835.24] for the day so you're saying check your
[832.52 - 837.72] breathing yeah check your mind yes take
[835.24 - 840.64] your yoga mat try and start at least
[837.72 - 843.52] with 15 minutes a day if you are not
[840.64 - 845.88] giving yourself the priority to do that
[843.52 - 847.92] 15 to 20 minutes of that practice in the
[845.88 - 850.28] morning how do you expect the rest of
[847.92 - 852.00] the day to work for you very powerful
[850.28 - 853.92] how do you expect the rest of the day to
[852.00 - 856.08] work for you if you're not respecting
[853.92 - 857.88] your body exactly powerful words for
[856.08 - 860.44] miruna over here so you're doing the
[857.88 - 862.24] pranayama you're doing the yoga but now
[860.44 - 865.44] I'm confused because somewhere in my
[862.24 - 867.24] head meditation is floating okay so so
[865.44 - 869.32] put the dots together for all of us who
[867.24 - 870.60] are uninitiated into this practice all
[869.32 - 872.44] right let me just tell you about the
[870.60 - 874.72] rest of my day what I usually do and
[872.44 - 878.60] I'll come to the meditation part as well
[874.72 - 882.40] so as soon as I'm done with my pranama I
[878.60 - 885.72] do couple of Arenas which are targeted
[882.40 - 887.12] towards my specific needs now this is
[885.72 - 890.60] not something which I have usually
[887.12 - 892.60] shared with people actually in fact
[890.60 - 895.68] people don't know but I have actually
[892.60 - 897.92] had a thyroid issue for very long and I
[895.68 - 899.32] am practicing pranama specifically to
[897.92 - 901.64] treat that and manage that and I've
[899.32 - 904.76] actually got it under control by myself
[901.64 - 907.00] without any medication wow right only
[904.76 - 909.60] through pranayam breathing only through
[907.00 - 911.76] the ASAS so there are certain pranam
[909.60 - 915.20] techniques which Target your thyroid
[911.76 - 917.56] gland which Target your neck right as
[915.20 - 919.36] well as ASAS these inversion ASAS where
[917.56 - 920.84] you do sarvangasana you see people doing
[919.36 - 922.76] the shoulder stand right they put their
[920.84 - 925.32] legs completely up it targets your
[922.76 - 927.04] thyroid gland so depending on what you
[925.32 - 929.84] want to work on or do you want to work
[927.04 - 933.24] on your overall Wellness right you
[929.84 - 936.76] target you do the specific pranam or
[933.24 - 939.40] ASAS for that so once that is done I
[936.76 - 940.80] come down and I have my lemon water
[939.40 - 942.76] everyone knows why lemon water is
[940.80 - 944.36] absolutely beautiful now people think
[942.76 - 946.68] that having lemon water tends to
[944.36 - 948.40] increase the acidity in your stomach but
[946.68 - 951.24] when it's mixed with your saliva it goes
[948.40 - 953.96] inside and becomes alkaline it's very
[951.24 - 956.16] good for detoxification have my meals
[953.96 - 957.40] and towards the evening that is when I
[956.16 - 960.88] do my
[957.40 - 963.08] meditation right PanAm is different it
[960.88 - 964.92] works on your breath it works on your
[963.08 - 967.64] stress levels it works on certain
[964.92 - 969.72] conditions that you might have right but
[967.64 - 971.76] meditation is more of the connection
[969.72 - 973.32] that you have with yourself you know
[971.76 - 976.48] there are a lot of people Ryan who go
[973.32 - 979.00] and look for answers outside right you
[976.48 - 982.44] could go to a temple you could go to
[979.00 - 984.40] someone who is very well very
[982.44 - 987.48] knowledgeable right you might go to
[984.40 - 989.08] different places for answers but truly
[987.48 - 990.72] with meditation what happens is it it
[989.08 - 994.48] forces you to look into
[990.72 - 997.64] yourself the answer is always closest to
[994.48 - 1000.16] home we ask the questions which are very
[997.64 - 1002.40] further away but meditation teaches you
[1000.16 - 1004.48] to ask the questions closest to home and
[1002.40 - 1007.12] when you ask that you will be able to
[1004.48 - 1010.32] get the answers which are further away
[1007.12 - 1012.44] right so it is a discipline I would say
[1010.32 - 1014.80] where you sit some meditation you have
[1012.44 - 1016.56] different forms of meditation itself
[1014.80 - 1018.92] right you could do and this you do in
[1016.56 - 1020.36] this you do in the E evening time this
[1018.92 - 1022.44] this is my self- practice that I do in
[1020.36 - 1024.52] the evening okay right so you can do
[1022.44 - 1026.96] meditation in the morning as well that
[1024.52 - 1029.16] is what is generally preferred however I
[1026.96 - 1031.48] have these certain habits which I have
[1029.16 - 1032.96] set for myself I do my pranam and yoga
[1031.48 - 1034.92] in the morning evening I do my
[1032.96 - 1037.56] meditation always make sure you have an
[1034.92 - 1040.60] empty stomach so post lunch 3 4 hours
[1037.56 - 1042.72] post lunch is always the best time to do
[1040.60 - 1045.40] the meditation so either you can do your
[1042.72 - 1049.56] own chanting or you can just focus on
[1045.40 - 1053.36] your breath so when you breathe in
[1049.56 - 1058.92] it sounds like so
[1053.36 - 1062.68] H hum H so you can focus on that
[1058.92 - 1064.48] so and hum right you could do that or
[1062.68 - 1066.88] you could do the chakra meditation that
[1064.48 - 1069.36] is we have seven chakras in the body you
[1066.88 - 1071.44] set the intention for each of the chakra
[1069.36 - 1074.32] and you there are certain mantras for
[1071.44 - 1075.92] each chakra that we chant out loud so
[1074.32 - 1077.36] those are different ways as well to
[1075.92 - 1079.16] balance your chakra so this is the
[1077.36 - 1080.88] different these are the different ways
[1079.16 - 1083.16] in which you can do meditation anyone
[1080.88 - 1085.84] can pick up anything that best suits
[1083.16 - 1088.28] them in meditation they say clear your
[1085.84 - 1090.80] mind now somebody like me who tries to
[1088.28 - 1092.48] clear the mind I'm thinking apples
[1090.80 - 1093.96] blueberries cherries this diet
[1092.48 - 1097.28] counseling that diet counseling this
[1093.96 - 1101.00] celebrity that celebrity and I can't
[1097.28 - 1103.52] clear my mind it doesn't rest so any
[1101.00 - 1105.00] tips for that okay that's a beautiful
[1103.52 - 1107.08] question and actually that is something
[1105.00 - 1108.52] that happens to everyone in fact oh it
[1107.08 - 1109.96] happens to everybody of course it
[1108.52 - 1112.36] happens to everybody oh I just thought
[1109.96 - 1114.16] my brain is wasn't wired to shut down
[1112.36 - 1115.92] absolutely not we all have a monkey mind
[1114.16 - 1118.12] right right have monkey mind I like that
[1115.92 - 1119.96] term that's exactly where my mind goop
[1118.12 - 1122.24] oop oop here and there and everything
[1119.96 - 1124.80] yeah exactly and why is that is because
[1122.24 - 1128.16] our brain always wants these
[1124.80 - 1130.36] distractions it wants these distractions
[1128.16 - 1132.60] it wants different things to get
[1130.36 - 1135.24] stimulated by at all points of time that
[1132.60 - 1137.00] is why we are so addicted to Reels that
[1135.24 - 1139.96] is why we're so addicted to shorts
[1137.00 - 1142.24] because we're getting that do mean that
[1139.96 - 1144.00] our brain wants that happiness in a very
[1142.24 - 1146.24] short amount of time we all have monkey
[1144.00 - 1148.40] brains so we need to get from Monkey
[1146.24 - 1151.16] Brains to meditation brains India are
[1148.40 - 1152.88] you listening in monkey brain to
[1151.16 - 1155.44] meditation brain that's what we need to
[1152.88 - 1157.32] do says miruna all right so let me tell
[1155.44 - 1160.12] you what you can do on a daily basis in
[1157.32 - 1162.12] a very simple way right can you start
[1160.12 - 1164.00] with doing one minute every day
[1162.12 - 1165.72] absolutely absolutely right that is that
[1164.00 - 1167.36] you don't even need to put any effort so
[1165.72 - 1170.32] I started one minute set the intention
[1167.36 - 1173.08] for one minute today H next week can you
[1170.32 - 1175.12] increase it to 2 minutes right I can
[1173.08 - 1177.28] absolutely possible and another way to
[1175.12 - 1179.28] also train your brain is while you are
[1177.28 - 1182.12] doing something are you doing something
[1179.28 - 1183.68] else also along with it while you are
[1182.12 - 1186.12] drinking your tea are you looking at
[1183.68 - 1188.36] your phone or can you just drink your
[1186.12 - 1190.52] tea by only focusing on your tea and
[1188.36 - 1193.00] completely enjoying it in that moment
[1190.52 - 1194.88] that is also meditation right I am
[1193.00 - 1197.72] taking a one minute break and meditating
[1194.88 - 1199.92] into my cup of tea right now but that's
[1197.72 - 1201.48] an amazing thought break it down into a
[1199.92 - 1203.44] smaller goal cuz I always thought I had
[1201.48 - 1205.20] to meditate for 1 hour and after 30
[1203.44 - 1207.28] seconds I'm like I can't do this it's
[1205.20 - 1209.32] just too long I got to get back to my
[1207.28 - 1211.40] pods and real cast and this and that and
[1209.32 - 1213.44] everything so 1 minute is your
[1211.40 - 1215.36] recommendation per week go to 2 minutes
[1213.44 - 1217.56] the next week and build from there take
[1215.36 - 1219.28] your time so you can increase 1 minute a
[1217.56 - 1221.76] day you can increase 1 minute a week
[1219.28 - 1224.08] that is up to you what you can do on a
[1221.76 - 1226.12] regular basis is train your mind as you
[1224.08 - 1227.92] doing your daily activities right when
[1226.12 - 1229.80] you are washing the dishes are you
[1227.92 - 1231.56] listening to music music and washing the
[1229.80 - 1234.20] dishes or can you just do that on your
[1231.56 - 1236.12] own by only focusing on these dishes
[1234.20 - 1239.00] right we are constantly training our
[1236.12 - 1240.76] brain to focus on this one activity so
[1239.00 - 1243.24] that when you sit for that meditation
[1240.76 - 1245.88] practice in the evening it is easier for
[1243.24 - 1247.76] you to focus on your breath or focus on
[1245.88 - 1249.52] whatever intention you are setting at
[1247.76 - 1253.08] that point and so how long do you do
[1249.52 - 1254.40] your meditation I do it for 20 minutes
[1253.08 - 1257.44] and that's about it because in the
[1254.40 - 1260.56] morning I will have about 1 hour of fan
[1257.44 - 1263.04] am my Asa do even when you do your ASAS
[1260.56 - 1266.20] it is some form of meditation because
[1263.04 - 1268.76] you're focusing on the posture you're
[1266.20 - 1270.92] focusing on your breath that's why my
[1268.76 - 1273.04] yoga instructor always keeps saying
[1270.92 - 1274.76] focus on your breath when I'm actually
[1273.04 - 1277.28] focusing on a diet chart when I'm doing
[1274.76 - 1279.56] Mas now definitely we all very busy
[1277.28 - 1282.88] right right you're very busy so I think
[1279.56 - 1286.08] that W that we give our body every day
[1282.88 - 1289.08] which is kind of I think 4% of the day
[1286.08 - 1291.88] um is respecting the body
[1289.08 - 1294.96] uh recalibrating the mind recalibrating
[1291.88 - 1297.32] the muscles and in your case controlling
[1294.96 - 1299.68] even your thyroid recalibrating the
[1297.32 - 1302.04] thyroid using breath using your thoughts
[1299.68 - 1304.28] so powerful thoughts powerful thoughts
[1302.04 - 1307.96] and are you an early dinner person in
[1304.28 - 1311.00] your routine absolutely so I complete my
[1307.96 - 1314.60] dinner at 7 at Max if there is some
[1311.00 - 1316.92] obstacle in the way my Max is 8:00 and
[1314.60 - 1319.96] that's it and I will probably go to bed
[1316.92 - 1323.44] at 11:00 and I wake up at 6:30 that is
[1319.96 - 1326.76] my daily routine so why eating very
[1323.44 - 1328.08] early is important in fact the one
[1326.76 - 1329.92] biggest change you will see is you'll
[1328.08 - 1332.40] start to lose weight in fact you'll
[1329.92 - 1335.36] start to lose fat because what happens
[1332.40 - 1337.36] is when you eat early your body will
[1335.36 - 1340.32] anyway take those 3 to 4 hours to digest
[1337.36 - 1343.60] the food and the rest 6 to 7 hours your
[1340.32 - 1345.92] body is only focusing on detoxifying
[1343.60 - 1347.80] detoxification from inside cleaning we
[1345.92 - 1350.60] go out for these detox juices these
[1347.80 - 1352.52] detox diet and drinks no you don't even
[1350.60 - 1354.80] need that just have an early dinner just
[1352.52 - 1357.28] have an early dinner complete it have a
[1354.80 - 1358.84] well balanced dinner right that is more
[1357.28 - 1361.08] than enough it doesn't even have to be
[1358.84 - 1363.40] as complicated it's so simple right
[1361.08 - 1365.96] these are these small small simple ways
[1363.40 - 1369.84] in which you're helping your body become
[1365.96 - 1371.40] better from inside right so so I'm very
[1369.84 - 1373.92] enamored that you're talking about
[1371.40 - 1376.28] thyroid and your working on the breath
[1373.92 - 1378.88] and the ASAS to to help it and it's
[1376.28 - 1380.80] succeeded for you and I know a lot of
[1378.88 - 1383.20] yogic and gurus who have done this and
[1380.80 - 1385.52] it works for them and therefore as a
[1383.20 - 1387.44] nutritionist as a health coach I like to
[1385.52 - 1389.56] encourage my clients to bring that into
[1387.44 - 1391.04] their practice now a lot of people that
[1389.56 - 1394.12] follow you and a lot of people that
[1391.04 - 1396.52] follow me have very sedentary lives
[1394.12 - 1400.28] where desk jockies we sit at a desk and
[1396.52 - 1403.72] we work we use our brains we use our
[1400.28 - 1408.00] fingers a few tips from you about the
[1403.72 - 1410.32] yoga positions that we can focus on and
[1408.00 - 1413.60] uh some that can help people because
[1410.32 - 1416.72] they're not moving okay so this entire
[1413.60 - 1419.28] concept of sedentary life came into
[1416.72 - 1421.84] picture only over the past 30 to 40
[1419.28 - 1423.36] years there wasn't even a concept or
[1421.84 - 1424.56] knowledge about sedentary life
[1423.36 - 1426.12] especially in the time of our
[1424.56 - 1428.60] grandfathers right that was the
[1426.12 - 1430.80] Industrial Revolution manufacturing SE
[1428.60 - 1432.76] sector they were always out and about
[1430.80 - 1434.32] they were always walk in of course they
[1432.76 - 1436.68] had different stress that was going on
[1434.32 - 1438.60] but now it's the Scientific Revolution
[1436.68 - 1441.40] the technological Revolution right right
[1438.60 - 1444.24] we are forced to sit down our bodies are
[1441.40 - 1446.96] meant to move we are built to move and
[1444.24 - 1449.84] when we don't do that we see a list of
[1446.96 - 1452.96] issues that is inside couple of people
[1449.84 - 1455.20] who definitely need that are people with
[1452.96 - 1456.92] arthritis as you know that arthritis
[1455.20 - 1458.24] when you have two bones which are joined
[1456.92 - 1460.80] together you have the synovial fluid
[1458.24 - 1464.08] around it when you do not move the
[1460.80 - 1466.28] circulation of that fluid reduces and it
[1464.08 - 1469.00] worsens your pain that is why arthritis
[1466.28 - 1471.44] patients need to walk Di diabetics as
[1469.00 - 1473.28] well because they need to expend that
[1471.44 - 1475.96] glucose that is there in your blood
[1473.28 - 1479.24] small things you can do on a daily basis
[1475.96 - 1481.68] now one ASA which is very powerful is
[1479.24 - 1484.16] your ad mukas Swan ASA that is your
[1481.68 - 1487.00] downward facing dog so these ASAS which
[1484.16 - 1488.96] I'm telling you is for people who do not
[1487.00 - 1491.80] have enough Mobility do not have enough
[1488.96 - 1494.44] flexibility even people who are older
[1491.80 - 1496.76] can do this and start it off right so
[1494.44 - 1499.44] first one is your Adas Swan Asana that's
[1496.76 - 1501.88] your downward facing dog what it does is
[1499.44 - 1503.92] it strengthens your hamstrings
[1501.88 - 1506.84] strengthens your calves improves the
[1503.92 - 1508.60] flexibility of those regions as well as
[1506.84 - 1511.64] it improves the circulation to your
[1508.60 - 1513.48] brain so what this does is it helps you
[1511.64 - 1515.72] with your brain functions as well
[1513.48 - 1519.00] strengthens your shoulders a very simple
[1515.72 - 1522.20] ASA that you can do and how long should
[1519.00 - 1524.96] you hold this ASA hold it for one minute
[1522.20 - 1526.56] okay and how many times should I do it
[1524.96 - 1528.52] do it around three to four times that's
[1526.56 - 1531.56] more and in between the ASA what should
[1528.52 - 1534.00] I do go back to child's pose so as you
[1531.56 - 1535.76] are doing the ASA right you need to go
[1534.00 - 1539.00] back as you are resting you go back to
[1535.76 - 1541.72] the inversion of that pose okay right so
[1539.00 - 1543.60] Adas swanana you are in that downward
[1541.72 - 1546.28] facing dog you are in the inversion
[1543.60 - 1548.16] right opposite of that is your child
[1546.28 - 1550.76] pose so you go back to that child pose
[1548.16 - 1553.64] and rest right so that is one that one
[1550.76 - 1556.24] thing that you can do another one is
[1553.64 - 1557.36] virabhadrasana that is Warrior B POS
[1556.24 - 1559.20] right this is something that a lot of
[1557.36 - 1561.24] people have heard very simple you don't
[1559.20 - 1562.72] even need to put an effort for this pose
[1561.24 - 1565.36] but what is so beautiful is it
[1562.72 - 1568.04] strengthens your arms strengthens your
[1565.36 - 1570.08] shoulders and improves the flexibility
[1568.04 - 1572.08] of your hips so there are a lot of
[1570.08 - 1573.84] people who tend to lose this out when
[1572.08 - 1576.08] they get older right they find it
[1573.84 - 1578.36] difficult to move that is it because we
[1576.08 - 1580.52] sitting at the desk all the time so the
[1578.36 - 1582.76] hip flexors shorten up and stuff that
[1580.52 - 1584.56] right so that kind of opens it up opens
[1582.76 - 1586.84] it up right so this is also something
[1584.56 - 1588.68] which is very simple that you can do
[1586.84 - 1590.12] right on either side on the left side
[1588.68 - 1592.76] and on the right side so it's called The
[1590.12 - 1595.88] Warrior B pose another one that you can
[1592.76 - 1599.52] do is bujang gasana that is your Cobra
[1595.88 - 1602.48] pose right so what this does really well
[1599.52 - 1604.88] is it improves the flexibility of your
[1602.48 - 1607.20] spine now cuz we always sitting at the
[1604.88 - 1609.32] desk every day like that exactly exactly
[1607.20 - 1611.64] so it improves that it improves the
[1609.32 - 1614.80] upper respiratory system as well
[1611.64 - 1616.24] improves the strength of your wrist now
[1614.80 - 1617.96] people face a lot of issues with their
[1616.24 - 1619.56] wrist also right when they grow old the
[1617.96 - 1622.00] knee KN and the wrist is something that
[1619.56 - 1623.80] is first affected I feel like that is
[1622.00 - 1625.44] also something that works on your wrist
[1623.80 - 1627.92] was it because it puts some pressure
[1625.44 - 1630.72] there it helps you in the mobility of
[1627.92 - 1634.28] your R do you feel that if you start in
[1630.72 - 1636.32] your 20s and 30s these yoga ASAS these
[1634.28 - 1639.20] three that you mentioned uh it has a
[1636.32 - 1641.00] long-term effect in your old age as in
[1639.20 - 1642.84] it really helps them out so it's a
[1641.00 - 1645.00] mixture of a lot of things right when
[1642.84 - 1646.80] you are practicing your breathing right
[1645.00 - 1649.32] when you are practicing your
[1646.80 - 1650.80] ASAS that is
[1649.32 - 1652.60] when you start it off early you will
[1650.80 - 1655.32] definitely reap the results towards the
[1652.60 - 1658.76] end why I'm asking this question is a
[1655.32 - 1662.68] majority of my clients that come to me
[1658.76 - 1664.96] are in the 45 Plus Age category so they
[1662.68 - 1667.56] have done the hard work sedentary work
[1664.96 - 1669.96] working in the office you know climbing
[1667.56 - 1672.36] the corporate ladder getting successful
[1669.96 - 1676.04] ignoring their health ignoring their
[1672.36 - 1679.76] body and when I do meet youngsters 20 to
[1676.04 - 1682.08] 40 I keep telling them I meet the 40s to
[1679.76 - 1685.24] 70s and the one thing that they say is
[1682.08 - 1690.04] can I go back in time and change my
[1685.24 - 1692.16] health okay so you're a young lady you
[1690.04 - 1696.28] do this as a
[1692.16 - 1699.24] profession do you think that the Young
[1696.28 - 1701.76] Generation will get a better benefit in
[1699.24 - 1704.32] starting yoga in their 20s and 30s or
[1701.76 - 1706.48] 30s and 40s or they can start it later
[1704.32 - 1708.16] on in their life once they retired so
[1706.48 - 1710.44] here's the thing right let's take the
[1708.16 - 1712.36] example of money okay when you take
[1710.44 - 1714.80] money you are saving let's say 1,000
[1712.36 - 1717.64] rupees every month starting now starting
[1714.80 - 1720.88] at your 20s right and you are constantly
[1717.64 - 1723.40] deposit depositing that into an FD or
[1720.88 - 1725.64] your stocks your sips whatever it is
[1723.40 - 1728.44] towards the end you probably have
[1725.64 - 1729.76] Financial Freedom by the time you're 40
[1728.44 - 1732.44] that's what happens right whereas when
[1729.76 - 1734.84] you start at 40 you need a higher
[1732.44 - 1736.96] Capital that's me it's 40 I started
[1734.84 - 1738.92] saving so now I have lesser bank balance
[1736.96 - 1741.04] than a 25 year old today because a
[1738.92 - 1744.56] 20-year-old started so you're saying do
[1741.04 - 1747.28] a sip for yoga and breath and meditation
[1744.56 - 1750.00] exactly you will see yourself aging very
[1747.28 - 1753.28] slowly so people wonder right why yoga
[1750.00 - 1755.08] gurus or teachers they look so young it
[1753.28 - 1758.76] is because we are practicing these
[1755.08 - 1760.56] things from inside not just on the mat
[1758.76 - 1763.00] people think that yoga is about
[1760.56 - 1766.08] practicing this pranaa ASAS for that 1
[1763.00 - 1768.16] hour on the mat but it is not just that
[1766.08 - 1771.12] it is about how you live the rest of the
[1768.16 - 1773.04] day as well when you are eating when you
[1771.12 - 1775.20] are sitting do you have the intention of
[1773.04 - 1777.76] just focusing on your food and are you
[1775.20 - 1779.48] sitting up straight now why this is very
[1777.76 - 1780.88] important is that when you're sitting up
[1779.48 - 1783.12] straight and when you're eating your
[1780.88 - 1784.64] food your breathing automatically goes
[1783.12 - 1786.44] into your stomach whereas when you're
[1784.64 - 1789.40] sitting a little crunched or
[1786.44 - 1790.88] hunched your stomach is constricted now
[1789.40 - 1793.08] the breathing automatically goes into
[1790.88 - 1795.44] your chest so what your body thinks is
[1793.08 - 1797.80] it's in a state of stress as it is
[1795.44 - 1800.44] breathing in your chest your body moves
[1797.80 - 1802.32] into to a parasympathetic state of mind
[1800.44 - 1804.60] and the food that you eat is not
[1802.32 - 1806.48] digested well or the glucose is always
[1804.60 - 1808.48] in your bloodstream whereas when you
[1806.48 - 1810.16] breathe through your stomach you're
[1808.48 - 1812.72] telling your body that I am in a state
[1810.16 - 1815.24] of rest and digest please take the food
[1812.72 - 1818.04] that is there utilize it well for the
[1815.24 - 1820.68] cells to function when you are breathing
[1818.04 - 1822.00] every part of the day are you in a
[1820.68 - 1823.48] constant state of stress where you
[1822.00 - 1825.48] breathing through your chest you know a
[1823.48 - 1827.28] lot of my students have told me that yes
[1825.48 - 1828.48] mirina I'm mostly breathing out of my
[1827.28 - 1831.16] chest
[1828.48 - 1833.28] it is right it is necessary but are you
[1831.16 - 1836.60] allowing your body to go back to that
[1833.28 - 1839.48] state of relaxation after that that is
[1836.60 - 1841.48] what is very important this is why
[1839.48 - 1843.76] knowing this understanding this
[1841.48 - 1846.44] knowledge understanding how to implement
[1843.76 - 1849.52] that in your body in the right ways will
[1846.44 - 1852.64] automatically help you look better feel
[1849.52 - 1855.08] better in fact yogis do not really need
[1852.64 - 1857.44] that much food you see people they are
[1855.08 - 1858.92] barely eating they will eat so little
[1857.44 - 1860.76] food
[1858.92 - 1863.68] they will barely need anything for their
[1860.76 - 1866.48] sustenance why it is because even what
[1863.68 - 1868.84] they are eating is enough to energize
[1866.48 - 1870.72] them the pranayama that they practicing
[1868.84 - 1872.84] every single day is enough to energize
[1870.72 - 1875.72] them that's life force energy basically
[1872.84 - 1878.12] for you so speaking of Life Force we
[1875.72 - 1880.72] both live in one of the most happening
[1878.12 - 1883.92] cities in the world with a lot of life
[1880.72 - 1885.28] in it there's a lot of force in it uh
[1883.92 - 1887.44] and so let's talk about our beautiful
[1885.28 - 1889.36] city of Bangalore um you know and there
[1887.44 - 1892.40] are a lot of issues that are happening
[1889.36 - 1893.96] for us and I believe the younger
[1892.40 - 1895.64] generation is the generation that's
[1893.96 - 1898.16] going to lead us to the better
[1895.64 - 1900.48] development of our cities and the world
[1898.16 - 1903.96] so let's take a few holistic health
[1900.48 - 1906.24] things you know we live with hard water
[1903.96 - 1908.56] and you're a person who influences a lot
[1906.24 - 1911.52] of youngsters what's your advice we live
[1908.56 - 1913.84] with hard water any tips from miruna
[1911.52 - 1915.96] okay so first we need to understand what
[1913.84 - 1917.40] hard water even is it is of course the
[1915.96 - 1920.40] calcium and magnesium salts that are
[1917.40 - 1922.32] present in water now why this is really
[1920.40 - 1924.96] bad is you will see an immediate
[1922.32 - 1927.40] difference when you wash your hair your
[1924.96 - 1930.64] hair becomes dry it becomes brittle it
[1927.40 - 1932.36] starts to fall a lot in fact I had done
[1930.64 - 1936.36] uh hair coloring and bleaching in
[1932.36 - 1938.76] another city came to Bangalore and I'm
[1936.36 - 1940.60] not joking within 2 weeks my hair
[1938.76 - 1943.32] started to look like a
[1940.60 - 1946.84] broomstick it became so bad so it is
[1943.32 - 1949.08] very bad for colored hair as well this
[1946.84 - 1950.88] hard water right so how simple ways in
[1949.08 - 1953.52] which you can test whether your building
[1950.88 - 1955.36] has hard water or not so this will be
[1953.52 - 1957.16] again dependent on the water supply that
[1955.36 - 1958.36] you have right depends on the areas
[1957.16 - 1960.56] depends on the buildings where you're
[1958.36 - 1962.76] getting your water from a simple way to
[1960.56 - 1965.76] test it is take a clean water bottle a
[1962.76 - 1968.72] clear water bottle put half of it with
[1965.76 - 1972.28] water and put a clear soap any sort of
[1968.72 - 1974.44] liquid soap right just shake it well if
[1972.28 - 1977.32] the entire half the other half of that
[1974.44 - 1978.92] water bottle has soap bubbles right then
[1977.32 - 1981.28] your water is soft water it is good for
[1978.92 - 1983.68] your hair but most of our Waters we will
[1981.28 - 1985.04] see the soap is just a very thin layer
[1983.68 - 1986.72] on top of the water that is when you
[1985.04 - 1988.88] know it's hard water or you see your
[1986.72 - 1991.28] utensils you see your shower faucets
[1988.88 - 1993.80] they're all salt salt marks exactly
[1991.28 - 1996.80] those white deposits and I tend I used
[1993.80 - 1999.16] to think that those white deposits were
[1996.80 - 2000.96] soap the soap that you used to clean
[1999.16 - 2003.40] your dishes right I thought it was that
[2000.96 - 2005.12] but in fact it was the water so those
[2003.40 - 2007.20] are the small ways in which you can see
[2005.12 - 2010.12] whether you have hard water or soft
[2007.20 - 2012.36] water and how you can overcome that so
[2010.12 - 2014.72] one thing that I started to do in
[2012.36 - 2016.56] Bangalore I is I started to wash my hair
[2014.72 - 2018.96] lesser you don't need to be washing your
[2016.56 - 2020.56] hair every two days not needed there are
[2018.96 - 2023.44] some people who wash their hair every
[2020.56 - 2027.04] day why do you want to subject your hair
[2023.44 - 2028.56] through so many chemicals so much uh of
[2027.04 - 2032.20] these salts every single day it's not
[2028.56 - 2035.40] required in fact over time I trained my
[2032.20 - 2037.40] hair to I train my hair in such a way
[2035.40 - 2039.52] that I just need to wash it twice a week
[2037.40 - 2042.00] before before I wash my hair I soak it
[2039.52 - 2043.76] in oil really well those disgusting
[2042.00 - 2046.48] smelly oils that you get from your
[2043.76 - 2048.44] hometown the ones that you used to shy
[2046.48 - 2051.08] away from or I used to think what is my
[2048.44 - 2053.40] dad even applying on his hair the entire
[2051.08 - 2055.80] house smells so bad those are the best
[2053.40 - 2057.88] oils unfortunately not the ones which
[2055.80 - 2060.40] smell very beautiful right so I soak it
[2057.88 - 2062.96] on my hair for a good four to 5 hours
[2060.40 - 2065.56] take a head wash only twice a week and
[2062.96 - 2067.44] have these shampoos which don't do not
[2065.56 - 2069.28] have these harsher chemicals right which
[2067.44 - 2071.68] do not not have sodium Laurel sulfate
[2069.28 - 2074.04] sodium laal sulfate parabens all of that
[2071.68 - 2076.28] because those tend to dry your hair and
[2074.04 - 2077.64] when they dry your hair you think I need
[2076.28 - 2081.24] to apply
[2077.64 - 2085.88] conditioner so I'll share my secret with
[2081.24 - 2087.48] you so my wife also has frizzy hair
[2085.88 - 2089.72] she's like do something about the hard
[2087.48 - 2092.40] water you're a famous nutritionist I'm
[2089.72 - 2094.24] like I'm not the water supply guy right
[2092.40 - 2097.36] so what I did is I went and did a little
[2094.24 - 2100.60] bit of research and on the Sha head you
[2097.36 - 2103.48] can actually put a filter a water
[2100.60 - 2106.00] softening filter so there's a company
[2103.48 - 2109.44] called water science okay that develops
[2106.00 - 2112.20] these filters so every 6 months I put in
[2109.44 - 2114.56] a new filter and that filter is actually
[2112.20 - 2117.76] um particles of they look like salt
[2114.56 - 2120.00] crystals so apparently it bonds with the
[2117.76 - 2122.72] salts of calcium magnesium and other
[2120.00 - 2125.16] salts and holds it back and you get a
[2122.72 - 2127.24] softer water yeah so unless you go for a
[2125.16 - 2129.36] really good company like that it works
[2127.24 - 2131.08] whereas initially I went to Amazon and
[2129.36 - 2133.04] just checked what is the most reviewed
[2131.08 - 2135.84] researched whatever I picked that and it
[2133.04 - 2139.28] did not work at all so in fact what I
[2135.84 - 2141.24] started to do is um I started to use the
[2139.28 - 2143.20] filter water the that you get for
[2141.24 - 2145.32] drinking I have many of my clients
[2143.20 - 2148.32] celebrity actors and actresses who do
[2145.32 - 2151.00] that and so they have the normal shower
[2148.32 - 2153.80] but then the last rinse exactly the one
[2151.00 - 2157.24] or two liters is done with a softer
[2153.80 - 2158.92] water or a water that is uh ph balanced
[2157.24 - 2160.40] for their hair yeah so that is also
[2158.92 - 2162.28] something that I do once I'm done with
[2160.40 - 2164.68] the entire wash towards the end I have
[2162.28 - 2167.44] this entire jug where I just dunk my
[2164.68 - 2170.16] entire head in the filtered water that
[2167.44 - 2172.12] is I would say not very environment
[2170.16 - 2173.80] friendly probably but if you have severe
[2172.12 - 2175.88] hair loss then this is probably one of
[2173.80 - 2177.52] the best ways to go you know I've just
[2175.88 - 2180.64] got a thought in my head is like we talk
[2177.52 - 2182.68] about water um and the first thought
[2180.64 - 2185.32] that came to my head was plastic water
[2182.68 - 2188.28] bottles now we surrounded by a lot of
[2185.32 - 2191.52] microplastics what do you do Mar
[2188.28 - 2194.00] as meditation and yoga practition now
[2191.52 - 2196.92] you know Wellness is your main state so
[2194.00 - 2200.48] what do you do to reduce the Plastics in
[2196.92 - 2204.76] your life okay well there are two ways
[2200.48 - 2207.96] in which you can approach this one is to
[2204.76 - 2210.20] reduce your exposure towards it and the
[2207.96 - 2212.60] second is to make your body or enhance
[2210.20 - 2216.20] your body's natural detoxification
[2212.60 - 2218.16] mechanism right so the first thing is
[2216.20 - 2222.40] your synthetic
[2218.16 - 2224.88] textiles that is that produces 38% of
[2222.40 - 2228.56] the world's microplastics whe Believe It
[2224.88 - 2230.56] or Not wow synthetic textiles only why
[2228.56 - 2232.24] is because when you provide this kind of
[2230.56 - 2234.96] abration when you rub against it when
[2232.24 - 2237.00] you put it in the washing or the dryer
[2234.96 - 2239.64] that friction that is created releases
[2237.00 - 2241.72] these polyester Fabrics into the air or
[2239.64 - 2244.68] onto your skin or you could probably
[2241.72 - 2247.12] ingest it you never know right whereas
[2244.68 - 2249.76] when you look at these natural fibers
[2247.12 - 2252.28] made out of of cotton hemp jute whatever
[2249.76 - 2254.28] it is they are bigger so even when the
[2252.28 - 2256.84] friction happens they tend to Clump up
[2254.28 - 2258.88] together and it's big enough for you to
[2256.84 - 2261.44] realize that okay I've inhaled something
[2258.88 - 2264.00] else inside of me and those actually
[2261.44 - 2265.88] will not cause any kind of endocrine
[2264.00 - 2268.44] disruption or anything as such in your
[2265.88 - 2270.76] body whereas synthetic fibers is one of
[2268.44 - 2272.60] the largest so switching to natural
[2270.76 - 2277.00] cotton natural fibers is always one of
[2272.60 - 2279.88] the best options another thing is your
[2277.00 - 2282.52] cosme ICS believe it or not one of the
[2279.88 - 2283.76] lipsticks that I actually had had the
[2282.52 - 2286.04] word
[2283.76 - 2289.12] polyethylene in the ingredients that's
[2286.04 - 2291.36] used in um wind uh to prevent the wind
[2289.12 - 2292.84] screens from frosting up yeah a lot of
[2291.36 - 2295.24] these Plastics have that right all these
[2292.84 - 2297.16] plastic was in lipstick yes so you're
[2295.24 - 2298.56] putting it in you're swalling it every
[2297.16 - 2302.12] day exactly and not I never thought
[2298.56 - 2304.20] about lipsticks yeah and women whether
[2302.12 - 2306.24] they use a foundation whether they use
[2304.20 - 2308.80] you know blush kajel whatever it is
[2306.24 - 2310.76] lipsticks are the biggest
[2308.80 - 2313.56] game changers I would say when it comes
[2310.76 - 2315.72] to like transforming your look lipsticks
[2313.56 - 2317.60] make or break your face I mean I love
[2315.72 - 2319.48] lipsticks in fact that is the one piece
[2317.60 - 2321.16] of makeup that I always use so so what
[2319.48 - 2324.36] would you advise all the women go for
[2321.16 - 2326.12] more organic uh um lipsticks are such
[2324.36 - 2327.40] things available I don't know about this
[2326.12 - 2329.32] yeah they are available but they are
[2327.40 - 2331.76] definitely little bit more expensive but
[2329.32 - 2333.00] isn't your body worth it right exactly
[2331.76 - 2335.68] because then you're putting Plastics
[2333.00 - 2338.76] directly into and you use the word
[2335.68 - 2340.56] endocrine disruptor so I'm assuming that
[2338.76 - 2342.76] in addition to microplastics all the
[2340.56 - 2345.80] other chemicals are also disrupting your
[2342.76 - 2348.44] system yeah exactly so is it possible
[2345.80 - 2349.96] for you to reduce the consumption of all
[2348.44 - 2351.72] of these synthetic products that are
[2349.96 - 2353.40] there outside not just your lipsticks so
[2351.72 - 2355.52] when you look at lipsticks you have
[2353.40 - 2358.84] polyethylene polypropylene these are the
[2355.52 - 2360.60] two major components which you should be
[2358.84 - 2363.24] avoiding in lipsticks not just lipsticks
[2360.60 - 2365.44] but any kind of Cosmetics right another
[2363.24 - 2367.36] thing would be looking at your daily
[2365.44 - 2370.08] consumption of plastics itself your Cho
[2367.36 - 2371.80] choing board right we are using I used
[2370.08 - 2373.44] to use the plastic chopping board and I
[2371.80 - 2375.76] used to use a very sharp knife it used
[2373.44 - 2377.36] to have all of these scratches did not
[2375.76 - 2378.92] bother at all and we used to cut the
[2377.36 - 2381.48] vegetables on that and we used to
[2378.92 - 2383.96] scratch it scrape it and push it onto
[2381.48 - 2385.88] the pot right and then we wonder how is
[2383.96 - 2388.32] it possible to have microplastics in our
[2385.88 - 2391.40] blood because we are directly consuming
[2388.32 - 2394.44] it every single day in fact it was even
[2391.40 - 2397.44] proven that the feces of
[2394.44 - 2399.44] babies had large amount of microplastic
[2397.44 - 2401.28] that were present than the mother
[2399.44 - 2403.12] because through the placenta it's going
[2401.28 - 2404.68] to the child through the breast milk
[2403.12 - 2406.88] it's going to the child probably through
[2404.68 - 2409.72] the feeding bottle or like whatever it
[2406.88 - 2411.68] is right it is there all of us have
[2409.72 - 2414.04] these microplastics in our blood so one
[2411.68 - 2416.52] thing is to reduce the consumption
[2414.04 - 2419.48] reduce our exposure to it and another
[2416.52 - 2422.72] thing is how do you detoxify from within
[2419.48 - 2425.00] right one thing would be to um of course
[2422.72 - 2427.16] do pran and breathing pranama there are
[2425.00 - 2429.80] these specific practices which you can
[2427.16 - 2434.12] do do which will detoxify yourself from
[2429.80 - 2435.88] inside improve your lung um strength
[2434.12 - 2437.56] remove the toxins from your blood as
[2435.88 - 2439.24] well that is why you see these people
[2437.56 - 2441.64] when they practice for a very long time
[2439.24 - 2443.84] their skin clears up their face will
[2441.64 - 2445.00] start glowing their hair will get
[2443.84 - 2448.40] stronger and you will wonder what are
[2445.00 - 2450.44] they doing Simple just pra right another
[2448.40 - 2453.16] thing would be can you sweat every
[2450.44 - 2455.48] single day how do you improve that sweat
[2453.16 - 2458.12] is a beautiful way of detoxifying from
[2455.48 - 2459.80] inside not just for plastic
[2458.12 - 2461.72] but also for the heavier metals also
[2459.80 - 2464.20] that are there right so that or even can
[2461.72 - 2466.56] you go to a sauna sauna where you have a
[2464.20 - 2468.24] lot of heat subjected to you right where
[2466.56 - 2470.24] you are increasing that sweat and
[2468.24 - 2472.32] finally it's just the regular thing of
[2470.24 - 2474.52] having a good amount of fruits and
[2472.32 - 2477.24] vegetables in your diet as well as water
[2474.52 - 2479.68] see our body itself is made up of 60% of
[2477.24 - 2482.12] water so we need to give that right kind
[2479.68 - 2486.32] of food which will help our body also
[2482.12 - 2488.00] detox from within and the food which has
[2486.32 - 2489.80] the maximum amount of water is fruits
[2488.00 - 2492.28] and vegetables so just increase your
[2489.80 - 2495.16] consumption of that and just allow your
[2492.28 - 2497.04] body to detoxify from within awesome and
[2495.16 - 2499.92] you know when we started the podcast you
[2497.04 - 2502.20] say you don't touch your phone you start
[2499.92 - 2504.52] off your pranayama and yoga practice
[2502.20 - 2507.52] first thing in the morning we all know
[2504.52 - 2510.40] about phones cellular radiation
[2507.52 - 2512.92] electromagnetic frequency EMF what's
[2510.40 - 2516.60] your thought process what's your take on
[2512.92 - 2518.60] this okay so with each phone before
[2516.60 - 2521.92] anyone work purchases the phone there is
[2518.60 - 2524.96] one specific value called s value s now
[2521.92 - 2527.16] this is an engineer first and then a
[2524.96 - 2530.24] yogic person telling us so saf is what
[2527.16 - 2532.92] we're looking for S value s yeah and
[2530.24 - 2534.72] where do we look for that so s value you
[2532.92 - 2536.40] will have to look at it online or you
[2534.72 - 2538.12] can probably ask the person who is
[2536.40 - 2540.00] selling you that so I want to buy a new
[2538.12 - 2544.40] phone right now so I go and say the
[2540.00 - 2547.24] model of the phone s rating s value
[2544.40 - 2549.48] value yeah so what this is is is called
[2547.24 - 2551.04] specific absorption rate now when you
[2549.48 - 2553.92] have a phone it emits your radio
[2551.04 - 2556.64] frequency right it is the amount of
[2553.92 - 2560.24] energy that our body per unit mass of
[2556.64 - 2562.92] our body absorbs these radio frequencies
[2560.24 - 2565.92] right and what we want to do so higher
[2562.92 - 2569.16] the value more bad or lower the value is
[2565.92 - 2571.48] more okay so your what is the safe limit
[2569.16 - 2575.80] that is been prescribed to everyone is
[2571.48 - 2578.28] 1.6 watts per kg in fact my phone has at
[2575.80 - 2582.12] 0.98 there are phones which have the
[2578.28 - 2584.16] value of 0.2 0.3 I'm telling my research
[2582.12 - 2587.00] team to find this phone the lowest
[2584.16 - 2589.12] possible s value guys I need to buy a
[2587.00 - 2593.28] new phone my batter is dying out find me
[2589.12 - 2596.64] the lowest s value right so what this
[2593.28 - 2598.92] does is even if it might be a non-
[2596.64 - 2601.04] ionizing radiation right this is
[2598.92 - 2603.12] something that has come into picture
[2601.04 - 2605.28] probably over the last 20 30 years there
[2603.12 - 2607.88] isn't enough evidence or there isn't
[2605.28 - 2609.64] enough research which has put into into
[2607.88 - 2611.84] this particular field which tells us
[2609.64 - 2613.52] exactly how it affects our body there
[2611.84 - 2615.20] are two sides to this but why would you
[2613.52 - 2617.40] want to take that risk in the first
[2615.20 - 2619.84] place so even if those phones might be
[2617.40 - 2621.72] slightly expensive can you possibly make
[2619.84 - 2623.40] a better choice for yourself there are
[2621.72 - 2627.80] phones which are at
[2623.40 - 2629.60] 1.9 which are very high even some people
[2627.80 - 2631.28] might gravitate towards that probably
[2629.60 - 2634.00] because of the cost but they do not
[2631.28 - 2636.52] realize that the radiations that these
[2634.00 - 2637.80] phones are emitting are so high right so
[2636.52 - 2640.08] that is one thing that you really need
[2637.80 - 2643.16] to look into a couple of things which
[2640.08 - 2645.08] you can do in Bangalore as someone who
[2643.16 - 2646.80] is working in your desk job you are
[2645.08 - 2649.32] constantly surrounded by these EMF
[2646.80 - 2652.04] radiations all around us right so small
[2649.32 - 2654.80] practices can you do that is distance
[2652.04 - 2656.76] yourself from these for a good amount of
[2654.80 - 2658.52] time in a day that is when I wake up
[2656.76 - 2660.24] tell yourself that you will not use
[2658.52 - 2662.56] these devices for probably one or two
[2660.24 - 2665.00] hours finish your sad finish your
[2662.56 - 2667.64] practice finish your meals and then go
[2665.00 - 2669.32] towards these devices can you reduce the
[2667.64 - 2670.36] amount of Bluetooth devices that are
[2669.32 - 2671.76] there also in your phone this is
[2670.36 - 2674.00] something that you've also spoken about
[2671.76 - 2676.04] right your Bluetooth headphones your
[2674.00 - 2679.12] Bluetooth speakers all of that can you
[2676.04 - 2681.00] change to a wired one instead can you
[2679.12 - 2683.68] put your phone on airplane mode before
[2681.00 - 2685.84] you sleep or rather can you create a
[2683.68 - 2688.44] bedroom in such a way that it is an EMF
[2685.84 - 2691.64] fre Zone put all of your devices in
[2688.44 - 2694.44] another room and have one room which is
[2691.64 - 2696.72] dedicated having no EMF radiation
[2694.44 - 2698.60] whatsoever right or can you reduce
[2696.72 - 2701.68] amount of of smart devices imagine a
[2698.60 - 2704.36] techie marrying a yoga instructor saying
[2701.68 - 2707.20] no technology in the bedroom that's
[2704.36 - 2709.76] going to be the first thing Young
[2707.20 - 2712.88] Generation jenz when you approach in
[2709.76 - 2715.80] shadi.com bharatmatrimony.com ask us of
[2712.88 - 2717.44] other person manour to keep the phones
[2715.80 - 2718.80] out of the bedroom computers out of the
[2717.44 - 2721.12] bedroom or
[2718.80 - 2723.20] not so here's the thing right there are
[2721.12 - 2724.96] these small small things that you can do
[2723.20 - 2726.52] on a regular basis it doesn't have to be
[2724.96 - 2728.72] something that is very extreme very
[2726.52 - 2731.12] drastic you have to find that kind of
[2728.72 - 2735.16] balance within right so these are the
[2731.12 - 2737.36] awesome awesome and um a lot of us are
[2735.16 - 2741.80] living in this beautiful city of
[2737.36 - 2744.28] Bangalore the Silicon capital of India
[2741.80 - 2745.76] and soon maybe we can say the Silicon
[2744.28 - 2749.60] capital of the world we'll take the
[2745.76 - 2752.68] crown from San Francisco but U everybody
[2749.60 - 2755.24] who's young and comes to the city lives
[2752.68 - 2757.44] in paying guest accommodation studio
[2755.24 - 2760.00] apartments what's your advice
[2757.44 - 2763.16] to the youngsters coming in from their
[2760.00 - 2765.88] college into this great City focusing on
[2763.16 - 2769.76] their job but maybe not focusing on
[2765.88 - 2770.80] their health okay so um there are a
[2769.76 - 2773.88] couple of things that they can
[2770.80 - 2776.64] definitely do one thing is focus on what
[2773.88 - 2779.16] you can rather add to your meal rather
[2776.64 - 2781.24] than remove from it so people say that
[2779.16 - 2783.88] yeah processed food is bad sugar having
[2781.24 - 2785.28] high amounts of sugar and salt is bad
[2783.88 - 2787.52] instead of looking at what you can
[2785.28 - 2791.08] remove from your meal can you look at
[2787.52 - 2793.00] what positives I can add to it that's an
[2791.08 - 2795.84] entire attitude shift that you must have
[2793.00 - 2798.00] from within so when I wake up right when
[2795.84 - 2801.44] I'm staying at my PG can I have a small
[2798.00 - 2803.80] nuts jar a nuts mix where I keep next to
[2801.44 - 2805.96] my bed where I break my fast in the
[2803.80 - 2808.80] morning with a couple of nuts and a
[2805.96 - 2811.16] fruit or have an omelette rather than
[2808.80 - 2813.28] heading out for your PG food which tends
[2811.16 - 2816.16] to be heavy on the simple carbohydrate
[2813.28 - 2818.92] side right make these small changes
[2816.16 - 2820.68] instead of reaching out for coffee a lot
[2818.92 - 2822.68] of people who live these fast-paced
[2820.68 - 2825.00] lives not just people who are living in
[2822.68 - 2827.92] pgs as well but people who are working
[2825.00 - 2830.00] professionals also coffee or tea is the
[2827.92 - 2832.16] first thing that they reach out to but
[2830.00 - 2834.32] we all know that that does not exactly
[2832.16 - 2837.04] like work in our favor and what you do
[2834.32 - 2839.92] is lemon water first so that's a good
[2837.04 - 2842.28] tip uh do you have people who are
[2839.92 - 2844.72] youngsters who stay in pgs that come to
[2842.28 - 2847.40] you to do pranayama and meditation and
[2844.72 - 2849.52] does that help people so can in addition
[2847.40 - 2851.36] to the Food Part change of attitude
[2849.52 - 2853.32] which is what you just said do something
[2851.36 - 2855.84] more positive to your food rather than
[2853.32 - 2859.04] only focus on elimination of foods is
[2855.84 - 2863.76] there anything that um you can prescribe
[2859.04 - 2866.20] to the pg people okay so with PG or with
[2863.76 - 2869.16] anyone living a very hectic lifestyle
[2866.20 - 2871.40] prioritize your self-care beyond
[2869.16 - 2873.00] anything else and that would be can you
[2871.40 - 2875.28] do something to keep your mental health
[2873.00 - 2877.04] in check in fact pranay and meditation
[2875.28 - 2879.04] is something that will absolutely do do
[2877.04 - 2881.16] that because one thing you see with
[2879.04 - 2882.88] people who live these fast-paced lives
[2881.16 - 2885.00] it is like running a marathon right it
[2882.88 - 2887.56] is not a Sprint at the end of the day in
[2885.00 - 2889.28] a marathon when you see towards the last
[2887.56 - 2890.92] few kilometers that is there every
[2889.28 - 2893.72] single Runner will always say it is a
[2890.92 - 2895.56] battle against your mind right so the
[2893.72 - 2897.32] one thing that you can do to overcome
[2895.56 - 2899.20] that is your self-care take care of
[2897.32 - 2900.92] yourself from within how are you doing
[2899.20 - 2902.68] that are you practicing pranayama in the
[2900.92 - 2904.76] morning just take 15 minutes right as we
[2902.68 - 2906.52] had said earlier 15 minutes of that
[2904.76 - 2909.40] practice in the morning have your nuts
[2906.52 - 2912.24] and seeds are you having a good variety
[2909.40 - 2916.00] of fruits vegetables your legumes your
[2912.24 - 2918.08] pulses your whole grains your nuts and
[2916.00 - 2920.00] seeds and a good amount of water these
[2918.08 - 2922.80] are the five basic things that you need
[2920.00 - 2924.72] even in nutrition itself that is all are
[2922.80 - 2926.56] you able to take care of all of that are
[2924.72 - 2928.60] you doing your sad to take care of your
[2926.56 - 2930.88] mental health if these two parts are
[2928.60 - 2932.88] taken care of in your body your body
[2930.88 - 2935.32] will do so much more for you and you
[2932.88 - 2937.36] will see that you will be able to do
[2935.32 - 2939.80] your work in such a happy way you will
[2937.36 - 2942.12] no longer see your work as such a burden
[2939.80 - 2944.92] right so having that attitude shift that
[2942.12 - 2948.16] mental shift is like very much needed
[2944.92 - 2950.00] awesome so uh you know some of us have
[2948.16 - 2951.88] children inside of us and we don't know
[2950.00 - 2954.52] how to take care of oursel but many
[2951.88 - 2957.52] people already have children what are
[2954.52 - 2960.16] some of the tips that you give parents
[2957.52 - 2964.04] for children that is actually very much
[2960.16 - 2966.08] needed what you said in fact children
[2964.04 - 2968.36] look up to their parents right ever
[2966.08 - 2970.24] since they are the smallest of kids as
[2968.36 - 2972.20] soon as they understand what is going on
[2970.24 - 2974.96] around them they want to copy their
[2972.20 - 2976.60] parents right you you see all these cute
[2974.96 - 2978.72] videos also going around the internet
[2976.60 - 2980.60] where children are having the same
[2978.72 - 2982.36] sleeping Styles Behavior styles of
[2980.60 - 2984.76] probably their father or their mother
[2982.36 - 2988.76] right so they want to copy them can you
[2984.76 - 2991.00] as a parent show your kid that you are
[2988.76 - 2993.16] going to the gym to work out can you
[2991.00 - 2996.12] show your kid that you're eating healthy
[2993.16 - 2997.96] rather than reaching out for a couple of
[2996.12 - 2999.96] drinks when you are stressed out in the
[2997.96 - 3003.16] day right so one thing that I would want
[2999.96 - 3006.44] to tell your parents is that try to
[3003.16 - 3009.20] involve your kid a lot in the healthier
[3006.44 - 3011.60] activities that you have right when you
[3009.20 - 3013.52] are doing your meal prep can you make
[3011.60 - 3015.00] your kids wash a couple of vegetables
[3013.52 - 3016.68] which may look very colorful and so
[3015.00 - 3018.92] beautiful these kids will be so excited
[3016.68 - 3021.64] by seeing that have a small platter
[3018.92 - 3023.56] where you have healthier snacks rather
[3021.64 - 3026.24] than reaching out to probably french
[3023.56 - 3028.32] fries or something now I see a lot of
[3026.24 - 3030.12] this happen happening not just with kids
[3028.32 - 3033.20] but even with adults right when we look
[3030.12 - 3034.76] at certain mental related stresses that
[3033.20 - 3036.72] we may have in the day if our day goes
[3034.76 - 3038.92] bad what do we do we reach out to
[3036.72 - 3042.80] comfort food and these Comfort Foods
[3038.92 - 3046.52] tends to be overly salty overly sugary
[3042.80 - 3049.32] overly fried why is that because these
[3046.52 - 3051.56] salty sugary oily they cause neuro
[3049.32 - 3055.28] excitement in us they give us that sort
[3051.56 - 3057.76] of pleasure right can you instead help
[3055.28 - 3060.56] your kid feel these same things with
[3057.76 - 3063.52] healthier food have just cut a couple of
[3060.56 - 3066.64] lady fingers and just bake it with just
[3063.52 - 3068.96] some salt and chili powder and it tastes
[3066.64 - 3071.56] so beautiful it is so much better than
[3068.96 - 3074.56] having a french fry right so associate
[3071.56 - 3077.60] your kid with having these snacks into
[3074.56 - 3079.60] these positive emotions they will when
[3077.60 - 3081.12] they face all these mental stress mental
[3079.60 - 3082.96] disorders whatever it might be when they
[3081.12 - 3086.04] are not feeling so good they will
[3082.96 - 3088.72] automatically gravitate towards better
[3086.04 - 3091.60] eating you know when I was uh when I was
[3088.72 - 3094.20] a kid in fact in school my mother used
[3091.60 - 3096.52] to give me lunch boxes which were a
[3094.20 - 3098.28] little bit annoying for me you know my
[3096.52 - 3100.76] friends used to bring Maggie they used
[3098.28 - 3104.00] to bring chicken nuggets and sausage and
[3100.76 - 3106.52] all of that and I was so jealous of them
[3104.00 - 3108.28] whereas my mother gave me a chapati she
[3106.52 - 3110.48] gave me Dal she gave me some vegetables
[3108.28 - 3112.08] which was so cumbersome they could eat
[3110.48 - 3114.60] with folks and spoons whereas I had to
[3112.08 - 3117.16] sit on the table and properly eat my
[3114.60 - 3119.24] food but because of the ways in which
[3117.16 - 3121.88] she brought me up that is what makes me
[3119.24 - 3123.68] who I am now when I reach out to comfort
[3121.88 - 3126.36] I reach out to these kind of
[3123.68 - 3128.36] foods rather than reaching out to
[3126.36 - 3131.04] process food yeah reaching out to an
[3128.36 - 3133.84] unhealthy lifestyle I'm not saying don't
[3131.04 - 3136.32] eat that eat that as well but where is
[3133.84 - 3138.24] the balance are you having that 8020
[3136.32 - 3139.08] balance or not right that is what is
[3138.24 - 3142.16] more
[3139.08 - 3146.08] important and you know when you do this
[3142.16 - 3148.36] shopping for groceries and items and all
[3146.08 - 3151.32] what does miruna look for when she goes
[3148.36 - 3154.44] shopping you know for her health for her
[3151.32 - 3157.12] well-being for just the way she looks at
[3154.44 - 3160.72] life okay so this is actually something
[3157.12 - 3164.16] that is uh that is pretty funny when I
[3160.72 - 3166.52] go shopping I come with four huge bags
[3164.16 - 3168.72] of vegetables like you would not believe
[3166.52 - 3170.52] some friends of mine have also made fun
[3168.72 - 3174.12] of me saying you're like the vegetable
[3170.52 - 3175.96] uh vegetable vendor of you know our flat
[3174.12 - 3178.00] and all of that because I absolutely
[3175.96 - 3181.32] love vegetable I was not as fond of
[3178.00 - 3183.52] fruits as much but uh vegetables I would
[3181.32 - 3185.44] say that I would buy so much of
[3183.52 - 3188.44] vegetables what's your favorite
[3185.44 - 3190.56] vegetable that's very difficult um you
[3188.44 - 3192.60] have many of them I have many of them
[3190.56 - 3194.32] there's the only thing that I did not
[3192.60 - 3196.92] like was bitter guard but I found a way
[3194.32 - 3199.68] to love that as well so it's all in the
[3196.92 - 3203.04] preparation and the acceptance yeah how
[3199.68 - 3206.32] do you prepare your bitter God okay so
[3203.04 - 3209.56] um you will have to cut it from cut it
[3206.32 - 3212.40] like L wise remove the white portion out
[3209.56 - 3214.72] and slice it up probably put some salt
[3212.40 - 3216.92] little chili powder Hali and just
[3214.72 - 3218.84] shallow fry or bake it and that's it it
[3216.92 - 3221.36] becomes like crispy chips my mouth is
[3218.84 - 3223.12] already watering too it becomes these
[3221.36 - 3225.52] crispy chips which you can eat and it
[3223.12 - 3227.68] has like no oil also so you mentioned
[3225.52 - 3229.36] that Bindy could be done in the same way
[3227.68 - 3231.20] and and bitter good can be done in the
[3229.36 - 3234.52] same way so these vegetables have these
[3231.20 - 3236.64] natural flavors of their own we don't
[3234.52 - 3238.44] need to as Indians we tend to add so
[3236.64 - 3240.92] much spice so much Masala so much
[3238.44 - 3243.56] gravies to it it's not needed at all
[3240.92 - 3245.20] bring out its natural characteristics so
[3243.56 - 3247.96] Mir you come back with four shopping
[3245.20 - 3249.76] bags okay of vegetables let's say you're
[3247.96 - 3252.32] not buying vegetables okay and you're
[3249.76 - 3254.44] going to buy any products in the market
[3252.32 - 3256.76] or what are you looking at as a person
[3254.44 - 3259.88] who's into the Wellness category all
[3256.76 - 3262.48] right so when it comes to let's say um
[3259.88 - 3264.88] not vegetables I gravitate towards
[3262.48 - 3267.84] having let's say you pick up a box of
[3264.88 - 3271.00] musle for breakfast right A lot of
[3267.84 - 3273.36] people have cereals these grains oats
[3271.00 - 3275.00] whatever it might be for breakfast right
[3273.36 - 3278.12] even if you might be having something
[3275.00 - 3280.92] that is packaged I look at the back look
[3278.12 - 3283.16] at the ingredients list usually if it
[3280.92 - 3284.24] has like a very large ingredient list it
[3283.16 - 3286.20] tends to have a lot of these
[3284.24 - 3290.52] preservatives additives
[3286.20 - 3292.96] synthetic um flavors
[3290.52 - 3295.92] colors can you look at all of that and
[3292.96 - 3298.12] see whether they are healthy or not and
[3295.92 - 3300.92] usually it is listed in their volume
[3298.12 - 3302.92] ratio right the one that is produced or
[3300.92 - 3304.36] it is present the most is present in the
[3302.92 - 3306.24] beginning that will be the first couple
[3304.36 - 3308.36] of ingredients and then it goes to the
[3306.24 - 3310.88] whatever is present the least right so I
[3308.36 - 3313.56] look at that is it healthy or not yes no
[3310.88 - 3315.60] I purchase it right and look at the
[3313.56 - 3317.72] amount of sodium also that is present in
[3315.60 - 3321.32] that product right the amount of sodium
[3317.72 - 3324.96] that our body needs per day is only 5 G
[3321.32 - 3326.12] that is half a teaspoon whereas now if
[3324.96 - 3327.32] you see there are a lot of products
[3326.12 - 3328.76] which have have a lot of sodium so
[3327.32 - 3331.44] something like these processed Meats
[3328.76 - 3334.12] cured meats cheese even if I have that I
[3331.44 - 3335.76] make sure that I limit my daily intake
[3334.12 - 3338.16] so you know when you're looking at items
[3335.76 - 3340.92] you're looking at labels uh you're
[3338.16 - 3342.68] educating yourself and even if you're
[3340.92 - 3344.04] having something that could be sinful
[3342.68 - 3347.52] for your body you're looking at
[3344.04 - 3352.24] limitation exactly awesome ideas from
[3347.52 - 3355.60] Mira so one question AA is it practical
[3352.24 - 3357.00] in 2024 the entire concept or the entire
[3355.60 - 3359.28] question of it being being practical or
[3357.00 - 3361.88] not should never be a
[3359.28 - 3363.52] question when it comes to Aura itself
[3361.88 - 3366.40] right let's understand what that is even
[3363.52 - 3368.20] in the first place so ayurva talks about
[3366.40 - 3371.04] the balance of the doshas that are there
[3368.20 - 3372.72] in your body right so what are doas
[3371.04 - 3374.84] there are mainly three right three body
[3372.72 - 3376.96] types you have Vata you have PA you have
[3374.84 - 3379.72] kafa that everybody knows how do you
[3376.96 - 3382.60] identify who you are okay so if you see
[3379.72 - 3385.36] Vata people they will tend to be very
[3382.60 - 3386.72] lean very thin they will eat whatever
[3385.36 - 3390.08] they want and they will not not gain
[3386.72 - 3392.04] weight at all right exactly exactly so
[3390.08 - 3393.92] you will see these people tend to be
[3392.04 - 3397.52] very extroverted they will tend to make
[3393.92 - 3399.64] friends so easily yeah exactly but when
[3397.52 - 3402.52] you look at paa right I am more of a paa
[3399.64 - 3404.76] dominant person right I will tend to be
[3402.52 - 3407.16] a little bit more muscular in built
[3404.76 - 3409.20] whereas if you see kafa you will tend to
[3407.16 - 3411.24] be little bit on the heavier side right
[3409.20 - 3412.96] that is one way to identify who you are
[3411.24 - 3415.16] another thing as I said Vata people
[3412.96 - 3416.92] you're very extroverted P people we tend
[3415.16 - 3419.04] to be slightly conserv we'll be a little
[3416.92 - 3421.04] bit more calculative with who we meet
[3419.04 - 3423.32] who we talk we will think okay how do I
[3421.04 - 3425.32] go speak to this person you know what
[3423.32 - 3427.04] should I say so that he will be happy
[3425.32 - 3429.44] you know we will think a little bit more
[3427.04 - 3431.80] and we will approach that person also in
[3429.44 - 3435.04] a calculated way kafa people are very
[3431.80 - 3437.16] introverted okay look at the minds of
[3435.04 - 3441.00] these people vaata people you monkey
[3437.16 - 3443.40] mind right for you doing meditation is
[3441.00 - 3446.52] very important
[3443.40 - 3450.04] ah okay so you see how identifying who
[3446.52 - 3451.32] you are right you when you identify who
[3450.04 - 3452.80] you are you will get to know what
[3451.32 - 3456.36] exactly you're supposed to do to support
[3452.80 - 3458.44] your body type right people who are Bata
[3456.36 - 3459.28] dominant you should not be eating a lot
[3458.44 - 3461.40] of
[3459.28 - 3463.44] salads because it will come out of your
[3461.40 - 3466.76] body because the elements that are
[3463.44 - 3469.52] dominant in Vata is space and air it
[3466.76 - 3472.08] will not digest the raw food or the
[3469.52 - 3473.64] salads as much so having boiled
[3472.08 - 3477.60] vegetables is something that will
[3473.64 - 3479.36] support you much better whereas for me
[3477.60 - 3482.56] being pad dominant I will have to have
[3479.36 - 3484.16] more salads because the element of fire
[3482.56 - 3487.28] is very high in my so you have to calm
[3484.16 - 3491.48] it down calm it down very interesting
[3487.28 - 3494.96] very interesting so um there's one group
[3491.48 - 3498.24] of people that I feel need a lot of love
[3494.96 - 3500.40] and care which are teenage girls right
[3498.24 - 3503.00] we take ayura we take yoga we take
[3500.40 - 3506.12] meditation we get better hair we get
[3503.00 - 3508.32] better lipstick we get uh eating
[3506.12 - 3510.72] correctly so we have the the correct
[3508.32 - 3514.48] figure right what is your advice to
[3510.72 - 3517.28] teenage girls one thing which I will
[3514.48 - 3519.96] need not just teenage girls but the
[3517.28 - 3522.28] parents of them to understand is a lot
[3519.96 - 3525.28] of teenage girls they go through this
[3522.28 - 3528.84] very big transition in their lives when
[3525.28 - 3530.88] they attain puberty right that can be a
[3528.84 - 3532.88] very confusing time for most people
[3530.88 - 3534.76] right your body changes your hips start
[3532.88 - 3537.12] to grow larger you develop dress you
[3534.76 - 3538.64] start to look different you start to
[3537.12 - 3540.84] speak a little bit differently it's very
[3538.64 - 3543.16] confusing you know I still remember when
[3540.84 - 3545.40] my mother took me out to shop for a
[3543.16 - 3547.44] sports bra I was like CH what is this
[3545.40 - 3551.32] you know it was very weird you have to
[3547.44 - 3553.80] make that normal for the kid normal for
[3551.32 - 3555.96] that teenage girl you know educate her
[3553.80 - 3557.36] tell her why it is important right that
[3555.96 - 3559.64] is something that needs to come from the
[3557.36 - 3561.88] parent because if you are fifth if you
[3559.64 - 3563.84] are in fifth or sixth you do not have
[3561.88 - 3565.32] that maturity for yourself to do that
[3563.84 - 3567.40] right how much will you possibly go
[3565.32 - 3570.40] research even if you do you might be
[3567.40 - 3572.48] curious do you accept that from within
[3570.40 - 3574.16] that this is who this is what my body is
[3572.48 - 3575.52] this is that transition this is
[3574.16 - 3578.12] something that needs to come from the
[3575.52 - 3579.88] parent right you need to understand what
[3578.12 - 3581.76] are these sexual changes that are
[3579.88 - 3583.56] happening within you these hormones that
[3581.76 - 3585.88] are coming from within you will start to
[3583.56 - 3587.88] develop acne pimples you'll start to
[3585.88 - 3590.44] have hairfall these mood changes these
[3587.88 - 3592.32] mood swings what are these are these
[3590.44 - 3595.76] normal these are some things that you
[3592.32 - 3597.28] need to look at as well as a lot of
[3595.76 - 3599.16] these girls I see it's something that
[3597.28 - 3601.24] happened to me as well as soon as I
[3599.16 - 3603.52] attained puberty especially in India we
[3601.24 - 3606.20] don't tend to work out as much Sports is
[3603.52 - 3608.84] something that you drop off very normal
[3606.20 - 3611.00] right as parents can you encourage your
[3608.84 - 3612.56] girls to still continue not saying
[3611.00 - 3615.36] during those 3 days when we going
[3612.56 - 3617.56] through that pain during those 3 days I
[3615.36 - 3620.64] myself sit at home do not really do any
[3617.56 - 3623.96] work I do not subject myself to
[3620.64 - 3627.08] pranayama also I just sit there allow my
[3623.96 - 3628.88] body to you know heal from within and
[3627.08 - 3633.08] after those 3 days I continue my
[3628.88 - 3635.04] practice right can you allow them to do
[3633.08 - 3638.04] these physical activities continue it
[3635.04 - 3640.60] you'll have to support your girl as a
[3638.04 - 3643.28] parent just interrupting is there a
[3640.60 - 3645.24] chakra that is linked to the woman's
[3643.28 - 3648.16] menstruation cycle and then therefore is
[3645.24 - 3650.88] there an ASA that women can do during
[3648.16 - 3653.12] that period yeah so that is your sacral
[3650.88 - 3655.96] chakra that is there 1 in below your
[3653.12 - 3657.88] belly button right so there are couple
[3655.96 - 3660.04] couple of ASAS which you can do you can
[3657.88 - 3662.16] do the pigeon pose which is all these
[3660.04 - 3663.84] hip opening ASAS those are the ones
[3662.16 - 3665.92] which are very good malassa where you
[3663.84 - 3667.80] are sitting in a squatted position you
[3665.92 - 3669.44] know I see a lot of these older people
[3667.80 - 3671.60] can't even squat anymore in these Indian
[3669.44 - 3674.04] toilets these Indian traditional toilets
[3671.60 - 3677.20] that we had it's actually very good for
[3674.04 - 3679.56] hip opening right the malasa you have
[3677.20 - 3681.76] your pigeon pose all of that you can do
[3679.56 - 3683.80] so any sort of hip opening ASA is
[3681.76 - 3685.48] something that will really support that
[3683.80 - 3687.80] particular area and of course if you can
[3685.48 - 3690.44] do your Mantra chanting your meditation
[3687.80 - 3693.72] towards that particular chakra as well
[3690.44 - 3697.48] that will also help them
[3693.72 - 3699.52] awesome so you know we have talked about
[3697.48 - 3701.32] meditation we've talked about the mind
[3699.52 - 3705.08] we talked about the fire in the human

[3826.40 - 3829.44] you can't see that on the camera the
[3827.68 - 3831.68] filter doesn't capture it what is your
[3829.44 - 3834.48] secret I know it's the pranayama now
[3831.68 - 3836.12] it's the breath what else one thing
[3834.48 - 3838.20] which a lot of people can look at is
[3836.12 - 3840.28] whether you have dandruff or not so
[3838.20 - 3842.32] dandruff will tend to cause a lot of
[3840.28 - 3843.48] acne and pimples also on your face true
[3842.32 - 3845.24] can you take care of that are you
[3843.48 - 3847.88] switching out your pillows on a regular
[3845.24 - 3850.04] basis right the pillow covers they tend
[3847.88 - 3852.00] to carry that bacteria also even if you
[3850.04 - 3855.68] might be going and washing your hair are
[3852.00 - 3858.20] you switching these out damn in 20 years
[3855.68 - 3861.44] of practice I never thought about this
[3858.20 - 3863.04] that is so logical that is so logical so
[3861.44 - 3865.16] what you should do switch your pillow
[3863.04 - 3868.24] covers take your entire pillow go hang
[3865.16 - 3869.92] it out in the sun the sun will kill all
[3868.24 - 3871.96] of that bacteria let's go pillow
[3869.92 - 3873.16] shopping everyone pillow for Monday
[3871.96 - 3876.40] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[3873.16 - 3878.24] Saturday Sunday to to combat uh dendra
[3876.40 - 3880.52] that's what miruna says so you now have
[3878.24 - 3883.08] your pillow cases labeled so you don't
[3880.52 - 3884.44] have infection frequently for the fungus
[3883.08 - 3886.40] or the bacteria that are there on your
[3884.44 - 3889.28] hair exactly and depending on your body
[3886.40 - 3891.16] type so since I was very P dominant I
[3889.28 - 3892.64] tend to have a lot of fire from inside I
[3891.16 - 3895.72] was getting a lot of these breakouts
[3892.64 - 3897.68] itself so can I have all of these salads
[3895.72 - 3899.52] reduce the amount of spices also I'm
[3897.68 - 3902.08] having reduce the oil that is there I
[3899.52 - 3903.68] was having very oily skin right so
[3902.08 - 3905.56] according to your body type can you
[3903.68 - 3907.40] supplement yourself accordingly in the
[3905.56 - 3909.68] right way with the foods with the
[3907.40 - 3912.40] pranayama have sufficient amount of
[3909.68 - 3915.08] water right which will remove all of
[3912.40 - 3918.80] this from inside so before we wind up a
[3915.08 - 3920.76] lot of us get wound up right stress we
[3918.80 - 3923.04] fight a lot you if You observe the world
[3920.76 - 3925.72] today people are arguing more people
[3923.04 - 3928.24] have very acerbic opinions we don't
[3925.72 - 3931.00] allow somebody else to Live and Let Live
[3928.24 - 3934.08] as a person that vibrates in the realm
[3931.00 - 3937.36] of ancient Indian practices what are
[3934.08 - 3939.84] some of the tips that you do you
[3937.36 - 3943.16] practice or you would advise people that
[3939.84 - 3945.36] follow you for them to come out of a
[3943.16 - 3947.84] stressed event of a fight with a loved
[3945.36 - 3949.44] one a fight with a colleague or you just
[3947.84 - 3951.48] basically stressed because somebody's
[3949.44 - 3956.12] mistreated you how do you come out from
[3951.48 - 3958.44] that very quickly all right so you will
[3956.12 - 3961.36] again as I had said earlier a lot of
[3958.44 - 3964.36] what we project outside tends to be how
[3961.36 - 3967.28] we are feeling internally you know no
[3964.36 - 3969.64] matter what the environment is like
[3967.28 - 3972.16] outside can you be that light from
[3969.64 - 3975.36] within we tend to look for that outside
[3972.16 - 3979.32] in fact rather right we want to satisfy
[3975.36 - 3982.44] ourselves by buying a good house a good
[3979.32 - 3985.36] uh car a good bike right can you find
[3982.44 - 3987.68] that light within yourself when you do
[3985.36 - 3989.68] that that is by connecting better with
[3987.68 - 3991.64] yourself through meditation that is
[3989.68 - 3993.84] healing yourself allowing yourself to
[3991.64 - 3995.92] not be as stressed anymore through your
[3993.84 - 3997.72] pranayam through your breathing when
[3995.92 - 4001.00] you're eating well allowing those
[3997.72 - 4002.96] positive energies to flow inside of you
[4001.00 - 4005.84] you become that Beacon of light within
[4002.96 - 4008.12] yourself and when you are faced all of
[4005.84 - 4010.08] these situations from outside you are
[4008.12 - 4011.88] there right for yourself you don't need
[4010.08 - 4014.44] to reach out to something that is
[4011.88 - 4017.20] external anymore you are that home from
[4014.44 - 4020.20] within powerful words miruna become the
[4017.20 - 4023.20] beacon of Light have your own internal
[4020.20 - 4026.00] battery of vibration and if I can
[4023.20 - 4028.16] summarize today's thing with you is have
[4026.00 - 4030.76] your own me time first thing in the
[4028.16 - 4034.92] morning walk your day through with
[4030.76 - 4037.40] mindful breathing eat lot of veggies
