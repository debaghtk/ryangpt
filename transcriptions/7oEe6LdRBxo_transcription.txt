Transcript: well my profession says I'm a nutritionist but I think I'm also a chartered accountant you know why like a chartered accountant who does debit and credit a nutritionist also does calorie consumption and calorie expenditure a credit and a debit now I had the privilege of presenting my viewpoint on taxation for the wellness and healthcare industry now you know that Medical Care does not have GST it's not taxed but nutrition services exercise services and many Wellness Services come under the gamut of GST and I recently had the privilege of meeting our finance minister shrimati nirmala sitaraman now I presented to her why nutrition plans should not have a GST in addition to many requests like a medical vacation as well as allowing taxable India to claim deductible expenses on domestic help which allows creation of more jobs super excited I just got to meet the Finance Minister of India uh a big thanks to the state BJP economic cell for giving the opportunity to present as an entrepreneur in the healthcare space I submitted my questions to her you can watch the private interaction with ma'am and she answered in fielded questions from 14 or 15 of us from the industry I spoke about how nutrition and wellness space should have a lower GST tax regime and know a lot of Medical Care is required in India we're going to be the youngest but the sickest population you can hear the ambulance behind us uh you know you know what we need to take care of people and we can't wait till an ambulance has to come and pick you up right so I talk to her about as a nutritionist I'm a first generation entrepreneur probably the youngest in this room I employ about 168 people 90% of them are women and we do diet plans so one of the things that is coming from consumers is medicine is not under GST could you make Allied Services like nutrition gyms yoga so one of the thought process was could we go in that direction of lesser GST or no GST is a possibility if not at least the Medical Nutrition cases because when we have Standalone private businesses and we are not in hospitals it is a difficulty with regards to creating of more jobs in the country I feel that um yoga gym trainers dieticians we I can service around 300 people a year and earn an income pay my taxes people can also recruit such people so if we Empower this industry of Wellness India currently largest population youngest Workforce but we will be the sickest youngest population in the world so as a nutritionist I'm trying to think how do we get people to do more on their own so my request would be is could you give deductions diet plans medical test Health screenings my parents health screening that I pay for um and also in addition to that medical vacations is a thought that came from my team uh people are traveling outside the country could we create uh Retreats and centers and blue zones in India where people will go and spend their money and their health is taken care of so India is taking care of its Health on the face of it it sounds fine and I agree health and you know Wellness will have to be given all that care and attention but is it only through taxation and if it is through taxation only then I have to see the ramifications I think India would like to probably instead of spending on movies and outside food um we should incentivize them to spend on Healthcare they should tell kataka government to mock tax entertainment I'd like to take care of your health ma'am again I also talked about Healthcare screening blood test and all of these things in addition to Medical vacation where you and I should take holidays for our health and could it be part of tax deductible now I know this is visual thinking do you have any comments about how we can improve Healthcare so what I want you to do is fill in the comment box below with your ideas because I'll Cate these ideas with my team at the qua nutrition clinics and if I get a chance to meet with the government again I would definitely Cate and crystallize a lot of the best ideas that you and I are the arm admy that we can present to the Finance Minister and maybe even the prime minister of India
