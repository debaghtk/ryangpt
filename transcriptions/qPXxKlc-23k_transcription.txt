[1.52 - 6.96] hi my most important recommendation
[4.40 - 8.72] from a survival perspective in covent
[6.96 - 11.60] times is glutathione
[8.72 - 13.52] now the idea with healthy glutathione
[11.60 - 14.32] being at my shelf at home is very very
[13.52 - 17.04] simple
[14.32 - 17.84] i do know that in our nutrition protocol
[17.04 - 19.84] for kobe
[17.84 - 21.60] we have tulsi we have amla we have
[19.84 - 23.68] atarak we have black tea
[21.60 - 26.08] we have a glutamine we have n acetylene
[23.68 - 27.20] system but i also believe glutathione is
[26.08 - 29.84] very important here's
[27.20 - 32.08] why okay uh i'm going to be attaching a
[29.84 - 34.00] few links in these videos okay
[32.08 - 36.24] there's number one when you have
[34.00 - 39.04] inflammation in the lungs
[36.24 - 39.60] okay there is a removal of glutathione
[39.04 - 42.00] and for
[39.60 - 42.64] survival glutathione is really really
[42.00 - 44.64] important
[42.64 - 46.32] if you really want to know i am placing
[44.64 - 48.40] the link for the study here
[46.32 - 50.56] but you can see over here the role of
[48.40 - 52.56] glutathione in immunity and inflammation
[50.56 - 55.28] in the lungs this is one study
[52.56 - 55.92] the second study that is there is one of
[55.28 - 58.40] the most
[55.92 - 59.76] important studies that i have seen about
[58.40 - 62.40] glutathione
[59.76 - 63.44] endogenous deficiency deficiency of
[62.40 - 65.52] glutathione
[63.44 - 67.60] as the most likely cause of serious
[65.52 - 68.64] manifestations and dent in corbin 19
[67.60 - 70.48] patients
[68.64 - 72.48] glutathione goes down with drinking
[70.48 - 73.44] alcohol please don't drink alcohol in
[72.48 - 75.20] this period
[73.44 - 76.80] because it's going to affect your health
[75.20 - 78.32] if you're a high risk patient
[76.80 - 80.32] so all the elderly people if you're
[78.32 - 82.08] thinking though brandy and jin
[80.32 - 83.76] jin and vodka is going to help you
[82.08 - 84.72] you're wrong it's dropping your body of
[83.76 - 86.88] glutathione
[84.72 - 88.96] now glutathione is more efficacy in
[86.88 - 91.92] intravenous when you're in the hospitals
[88.96 - 93.68] the nhs in uk is recommending it as part
[91.92 - 96.24] of their coherent protocol as a
[93.68 - 97.12] cocktail of of supplements and drugs
[96.24 - 100.32] that they give people
[97.12 - 102.32] with covet positive tests however
[100.32 - 103.36] in high risk areas so if your neighbors
[102.32 - 105.60] getting covered
[103.36 - 107.12] a positive 19 testing and you know you
[105.60 - 108.88] want to check it out in your area
[107.12 - 110.72] then i would definitely recommend that
[108.88 - 114.24] you have glutathione
[110.72 - 114.80] in your supplement prescription protocol
[114.24 - 117.44] list
[114.80 - 119.52] if you need advice get in touch with me
[117.44 - 122.40] at kua nutrition or ryan fernando
[119.52 - 123.76] and i will tell you what is the dosage
[122.40 - 126.32] for glutathione
[123.76 - 126.96] and five other supplements that you can
[126.32 - 129.76] take
[126.96 - 130.88] which would improve your blood levels of
[129.76 - 133.52] these molecules
[130.88 - 135.60] that have already been documented to
[133.52 - 138.32] really really really help you
[135.60 - 139.52] in terms of either your covet positive
[138.32 - 141.04] or covert high risk
[139.52 - 145.20] or you're just scared and you want to
[141.04 - 145.20] keep your immune system boosted
