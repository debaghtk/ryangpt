in India being chubby is a sign of prosperity I still meet people who consider me very lean very skinny and they're like uh L you should put on some weight I get trolled on the internet that I should put on weight but the science says that in lab experiments on deficient calorie diets rats live longer people who are leaner actually live longer people who are leaner have a lower resting heart rate people who are fatter have a higher heart rate which means you put two hearts together as skinny guy and a fat guy The Fat Guy's heart has is beaten 20 30% more in the lifetime which means imagine if that was the engine after sometime you have to do a piston change right after some engine might seize also so longevity comes from a perspective of calorie control
