[134.52 - 139.68] famous Indian athlete banned for four
[136.60 - 142.88] years duti Chan has been banned for four
[139.68 - 145.72] years for for being caught with a
[142.88 - 149.88] positive dope test what is the function
[145.72 - 154.88] of v v is a world anti-doping agency
[149.88 - 158.56] parents coaches a very simple way a very
[154.88 - 160.00] simple way to get information is to go
[158.56 - 166.24] to Vada
[160.00 - 167.80] w.org and download the prohibited list
[166.24 - 169.48] if you want it easier just get in touch
[167.80 - 173.80] with me I'll guide
[169.48 - 177.24] you what is a function we're supposed to
[173.80 - 180.40] help in Code Compliance give you the
[177.24 - 182.04] prohibited list supp Force to be doing
[180.40 - 183.92] testing and investigations and doing
[182.04 - 185.92] research and development I want to
[183.92 - 188.80] explain to you today when you buy a
[185.92 - 192.32] medicine or when you buy a supplement
[188.80 - 194.68] how you can search for in the water list
[192.32 - 195.96] can I have the next slide yeah this one
[194.68 - 198.64] keep this slide
[195.96 - 200.68] please uh I've done this presentation in
[198.64 - 204.28] such a way
[200.68 - 206.80] that if you see The Orange Box every
[204.28 - 210.80] coach and every athlete can click this
[206.80 - 214.12] box and you will get the list to your
[210.80 - 217.72] phone and those of you who understand a
[214.12 - 219.88] PDF document suppose you buy a
[217.72 - 221.52] medicine and let's say the medicine
[219.88 - 225.28] contains
[221.52 - 229.84] paracetamol what you do you open up this
[225.28 - 232.48] PDF and you click search and type
[229.84 - 233.84] paracetamol if paracetamol does not come
[232.48 - 236.88] in the v
[233.84 - 239.76] list you know that okay this substance
[236.88 - 243.44] is not there again I need to stress to
[239.76 - 246.76] all of you the importance of protecting
[243.44 - 250.56] the athlete not getting a positive dope
[246.76 - 254.68] test relies on the athlete but these are
[250.56 - 255.76] sub Juniors and juniors so parents you
[254.68 - 258.76] are
[255.76 - 261.48] responsible parents you are responsible
[258.76 - 265.04] for what goes into your child's
[261.48 - 267.76] body coaches be careful on the
[265.04 - 269.96] supplements you recommend be careful on
[267.76 - 272.64] any medications that a doctor May
[269.96 - 275.12] prescrib it's important for you to know
[272.64 - 276.96] this because if your child is caught
[275.12 - 280.52] like Dy Chan today you get a fouryear
[276.96 - 285.28] band and forever your child is known as
[280.52 - 288.12] a cheater so this is very very important
[285.28 - 289.56] do you know recently people started
[288.12 - 291.92] doing plant
[289.56 - 295.48] protein uh some people are allergic to
[291.92 - 298.08] way protein way protein is milk
[295.48 - 301.12] protein so people started taking plant
[298.08 - 302.60] protein specifically hemp protein do you
[301.12 - 305.80] know if you take hem protein you will
[302.60 - 307.96] test positive because it has opioid like
[305.80 - 311.84] properties in it and opium like
[307.96 - 313.56] properties is there in the v list so I
[311.84 - 317.56] don't want to get into the technicality
[313.56 - 319.88] for parents simple for parents have a
[317.56 - 322.16] nutritionist have a sports medicine
[319.88 - 324.16] doctor if your child is swimming in a
[322.16 - 325.92] stadium like this and you're spending
[324.16 - 326.84] thousands of Rupees to come here to swim
[325.92 - 329.88] in a
[326.84 - 332.56] finals you should have the right with
[329.88 - 334.92] you which is your coach your trainer
[332.56 - 337.84] your nutritionist and possibly in your
[334.92 - 340.28] community a sports medicine doctor ask
[337.84 - 344.32] them what should I be taking what should
[340.28 - 346.28] I not take very interesting everybody I
[344.32 - 349.40] I was I was saying seeing some people
[346.28 - 350.48] shaking up a protein shake so I asked
[349.40 - 353.64] one of the
[350.48 - 357.48] swimmers uh which brands protein are you
[353.64 - 360.64] taking so he said XY Z who told
[357.48 - 363.16] you my friend is taking
[360.64 - 366.76] this very very
[363.16 - 368.20] important you want to understand that
[366.76 - 370.32] when you choose
[368.20 - 372.40] supplements you have to choose them with
[370.32 - 376.60] proper advice
[372.40 - 379.44] now only 8% 8% ask a dietician a sports
[376.60 - 382.52] dietician so please go in that direction
[379.44 - 385.20] but you know when these athletes test
[382.52 - 388.40] positive I'm always
[385.20 - 390.88] laughing I'm laughing because they say
[388.40 - 392.76] they give an excuse i c i was caught
[390.88 - 395.28] because it was found in a
[392.76 - 397.84] supplement let me tell you I have been
[395.28 - 400.44] doing this for 20 years I won two
[397.84 - 404.16] Olympic medals with shushil
[400.44 - 407.36] Kumar I have had more than 400 athletes
[404.16 - 409.84] and not a single dope test when athletes
[407.36 - 412.16] say they tested because of a supplement
[409.84 - 415.12] in my mind they could have been
[412.16 - 418.12] intentionally doping because if you say
[415.12 - 421.24] you have intentionally doped it's a life
[418.12 - 422.92] band so you blame the mother you blame
[421.24 - 424.52] the father you blame the country you
[422.92 - 426.24] blame the government you blame the
[424.52 - 429.44] supplement you even blame the swimming
[426.24 - 431.32] pool water for testing a do positive so
[429.44 - 433.84] it's very very important for you to
[431.32 - 436.52] understand your responsibility lies in
[433.84 - 438.08] knowing what you put into your body
[436.52 - 441.60] another thing can
[438.08 - 444.24] happen all the children who are here be
[441.60 - 447.64] careful be careful with your sports
[444.24 - 451.00] water bottle I know of an incident where
[447.64 - 453.04] a competing athlete CR a tablet and
[451.00 - 455.60] threw it in the sports drink bottle of
[453.04 - 458.24] the other person in training knowing
[455.60 - 460.36] that that person is the fastest swimmer
[458.24 - 463.12] and that person will test positive it
[460.36 - 465.52] was not swimming it was another
[463.12 - 469.04] sport so
[465.52 - 473.44] sabotage sabotage by coaches Sabotage by
[469.04 - 476.48] players Sabotage by anybody athlete
[473.44 - 480.52] you're responsible for what you put into
[476.48 - 484.76] your body if you're not sure don't take
[480.52 - 487.72] it so most importantly when I there is a
[484.76 - 488.60] site called inform Sports globally which
[487.72 - 490.92] test
[488.60 - 492.96] supplements now in India there are one
[490.92 - 496.32] or two companies that send their product
[492.96 - 499.00] for testing it will have a inform sports
[496.32 - 502.16] logo so if you look if you look at the
[499.00 - 504.60] bottom over there look for the logo
[502.16 - 507.72] products that have this
[504.60 - 510.56] logo are the better options for you to
[507.72 - 513.04] buy as a nutritional supplement because
[510.56 - 515.04] the manufacturer has given a guarantee
[513.04 - 518.12] that the batch has been tested and there
[515.04 - 518.96] are no ban substances in that what I do
[518.12 - 522.40] as a
[518.96 - 526.40] nutritionist I go to inform Sports
[522.40 - 529.08] website I type up inform Sports I say I
[526.40 - 533.00] want glutamine I want branchin amino
[529.08 - 535.12] acids I want uh sports drink I want
[533.00 - 537.88] magnesium I want a
[535.12 - 541.08] pre-workout I want a
[537.88 - 543.08] multivitamin if it informed Sports has a
[541.08 - 546.40] product it will list all the brands in
[543.08 - 549.00] the world then I call up a friend in
[546.40 - 552.44] America or Europe or Australia or look
[549.00 - 554.32] at which Indian company has that and
[552.44 - 557.36] then I order that supplement so that's
[554.32 - 557.36] one way you can be
[557.40 - 564.44] safer now the ways of intentional doping
[561.88 - 567.76] contaminated supplements contaminated
[564.44 - 570.24] food or drink I think the most important
[567.76 - 573.20] thing is lack of awareness
[570.24 - 576.24] I am recording this presentation and I'm
[573.20 - 578.16] hoping we can create more awareness I've
[576.24 - 582.28] been a nutritionist for the last 20
[578.16 - 585.00] years I'm 48 years old India in swimming
[582.28 - 587.52] has not yet won a medal at the
[585.00 - 589.96] Olympics we need to win a medal at
[587.52 - 592.36] Olympics and it starts by learning to
[589.96 - 594.00] eat the food correctly not do
[592.36 - 596.80] intentional
[594.00 - 598.56] doping this is very important and I'm
[596.80 - 600.60] glad for all of you staying back
[598.56 - 602.24] somebody in this audience today I'm
[600.60 - 604.32] hoping the blessings of the Creator is
[602.24 - 606.32] there on you to win a gold medal but you
[604.32 - 609.04] have to do it with your brain and if you
[606.32 - 611.52] do it with hard work yes diet and
[609.04 - 615.12] supplements can be prescribed which are
[611.52 - 618.08] legally possible you can take
[615.12 - 620.00] coffee you can take BCA you can take a
[618.08 - 622.76] protein powder but sometimes that
[620.00 - 625.00] protein powder manufactured by a cheap
[622.76 - 627.40] company or contaminated with
[625.00 - 629.60] bodybuilding supplements could test
[627.40 - 632.72] positive so please get
[629.60 - 635.88] a professional working with
[632.72 - 635.88] you I
[636.16 - 641.80] remember when I was much younger there
[639.08 - 644.88] was a brand called U
[641.80 - 648.76] BSN and many Indian athletes tested
[644.88 - 652.40] positive because one importer decided to
[648.76 - 654.84] bring BSN products to India and so all
[652.40 - 658.04] the supplement dealers started telling
[654.84 - 659.64] the coaches
[658.04 - 661.20] product
[659.64 - 663.80] unfortunately for all the people who
[661.20 - 666.52] consumed ctha 6 which was a way protein
[663.80 - 669.72] powder and noo explode which they got
[666.52 - 672.28] amazing pump in the gym they all tested
[669.72 - 674.68] positive this was about 10 years
[672.28 - 677.32] ago after that we have been much more
[674.68 - 680.88] cautious in India but parents I'd advise
[677.32 - 683.40] you don't blindly prescribe supplements
[680.88 - 686.52] coaches please don't blindly prescribe
[683.40 - 690.92] supplements let's work together to get
[686.52 - 692.96] the right thing cough medication
[690.92 - 695.64] uh can you go back please yeah cough
[692.96 - 698.36] medication so if you see the bottom if
[695.64 - 701.80] doctor gives cough medication if doctor
[698.36 - 704.44] gives a hormonal tablet or doctor gives
[701.80 - 707.48] cold medication or fever medication or
[704.44 - 711.72] upset stomach medication take the name
[707.48 - 713.80] of the medication type it in V's list
[711.72 - 716.00] when you type it in V's list you will
[713.80 - 719.92] come to know if it's banned or not what
[716.00 - 723.24] I do for my athletes we share a list
[719.92 - 727.76] of which medication they can
[723.24 - 730.56] take another thing about this whole
[727.76 - 734.08] thing a lot of
[730.56 - 736.80] times you may take ayura and
[734.08 - 739.12] Homeopathy do you know a famous Indian
[736.80 - 742.76] gymnast tested
[739.12 - 745.84] positive for cold medication from
[742.76 - 748.32] Homeopathy so all you mothers who are
[745.84 - 750.40] thinking of giving your kids Homeopathy
[748.32 - 752.76] and nothing is going to happen your
[750.40 - 755.72] child will test positive because
[752.76 - 757.20] Homeopathy contains a drug called hamine
[755.72 - 759.04] and hamine is
[757.20 - 761.80] found
[759.04 - 765.16] inside for stimulating the
[761.80 - 768.88] lungs to open it up when coughs and
[765.16 - 771.24] colds but V says it's a stimulant and
[768.88 - 773.72] you will test positive and get a ban so
[771.24 - 777.84] please don't be very smart saying oh I
[773.72 - 779.92] can take ayura I can take uh
[777.84 - 782.20] homeopathy
[779.92 - 785.36] uh these are the athletes that were
[782.20 - 788.12] caught with intentional doping okay I
[785.36 - 791.12] I've taken out their names because I
[788.12 - 793.04] don't want to publicly shame them but
[791.12 - 795.76] they're there in public
[793.04 - 799.00] domain he claimed that his food or
[795.76 - 802.96] drinks were tampered with resulting in
[799.00 - 805.56] positive test who is at fault the
[802.96 - 809.08] athlete please be careful with your food
[805.56 - 812.08] and drink if somebody wants you to be B
[809.08 - 814.48] right now they will contaminate your
[812.08 - 817.88] sport strink your protein powder be
[814.48 - 821.68] careful I I advise all parents have a
[817.88 - 822.92] bag with a lock a biometric lock or a
[821.68 - 825.04] numbered
[822.92 - 827.80] lock he alleged that he had
[825.04 - 830.20] intentionally consume contaminated
[827.80 - 832.84] supplement I think before contaminated
[830.20 - 835.36] supplement to get to a certain
[832.84 - 837.64] level those of us who have been one two
[835.36 - 839.56] decades in the sport understand
[837.64 - 841.80] intentional doping
[839.56 - 845.52] and contaminated supplement in my
[841.80 - 848.52] opinion 99% of the cases are intentional
[845.52 - 850.52] doping if it is a contaminated
[848.52 - 852.04] supplement it's
[850.52 - 855.28] because
[852.04 - 858.08] you did not do the necessary due
[855.28 - 860.68] diligence it is your responsibility now
[858.08 - 864.16] you may turn around say but sir how will
[860.68 - 870.12] we come to know which supplement to
[864.16 - 872.68] take 961 participants in this entire
[870.12 - 875.92] Nationals I can tell you without a doubt
[872.68 - 879.16] only 140 people are on a nutrition
[875.92 - 881.12] plan but 900 people are taking
[879.16 - 883.52] supplements who's asked you to take
[881.12 - 886.16] supplements what about food what about
[883.52 - 889.60] Dal chavel Roti are you eating it
[886.16 - 893.20] correctly by the way if you take certain
[889.60 - 896.56] medicines like antibiotics or you know
[893.20 - 899.80] quatin tonic water it could give you a
[896.56 - 902.76] false positive meaning
[899.80 - 905.56] you've never taken anything bad but when
[902.76 - 908.28] they're doing the dope test that
[905.56 - 911.00] molecule of a good medicine sometimes
[908.28 - 913.64] looks like a doping product and gives a
[911.00 - 916.84] false test that's why they have sample a
[913.64 - 919.52] and Sample B sample a is the first urine
[916.84 - 922.24] sample by the way for all the Juniors
[919.52 - 925.04] and the sub Juniors coaches you will
[922.24 - 927.88] know this already when you go for doping
[925.04 - 930.40] they will take a urine sample the dop
[927.88 - 932.00] person will stand there and look at you
[930.40 - 934.20] pee into the
[932.00 - 936.68] Container you'll be like wanting some
[934.20 - 939.52] privacy no because people have cheated
[936.68 - 941.48] even with false urine samples so they
[939.52 - 943.24] will want to see you pee into the
[941.48 - 944.96] Container so this is part of the whole
[943.24 - 946.84] thing you you have rights and
[944.96 - 948.92] responsibilities as an athlete I can
[946.84 - 953.40] share that with you for those who reach
[948.92 - 953.40] out to us uh on the number that I've
[954.04 - 958.76] given okay so I come to the food part I
[957.24 - 960.08] want to convince you that you can
[958.76 - 963.24] enhance
[960.08 - 965.92] performance first place to
[963.24 - 968.60] win today the timings would have been 2
[965.92 - 971.24] seconds faster for most people had they
[968.60 - 974.20] not eaten by a zato and
[971.24 - 978.52] swiggy you see the difference over
[974.20 - 981.16] here the source of food if it's homemade
[978.52 - 983.64] or online food delivery or restaurants
[981.16 - 986.40] most children are eating food from
[983.64 - 989.68] outside ingredients from a restaurant
[986.40 - 991.40] outsourced ingredients at home the most
[989.68 - 993.72] expensive and
[991.40 - 996.04] organic material prepackaged and
[993.72 - 998.44] processed at home is organic and
[996.04 - 1002.24] fresh look at the last
[998.44 - 1005.28] line Focus restaurants make food for
[1002.24 - 1008.72] profit the homemade food is made for
[1005.28 - 1011.28] enhancement of energy I can actually see
[1008.72 - 1014.84] this when athletes prepare their own
[1011.28 - 1016.96] food in fact Kenny who is the fastest
[1014.84 - 1019.00] 200 M athlete in the world they were
[1016.96 - 1021.68] ordering from out in Florida
[1019.00 - 1024.48] so he's like dude do you know something
[1021.68 - 1028.64] I started cooking my own food and I
[1024.48 - 1031.12] already feel that I recover faster so he
[1028.64 - 1034.52] asked me why is
[1031.12 - 1036.68] that I said that guy in the restaurant
[1034.52 - 1038.84] when he's cutting up the salad his boss
[1036.68 - 1040.96] is shouting at him and he's kicking him
[1038.84 - 1043.12] and doing everything and all how you
[1040.96 - 1046.52] think that salad is being prepared with
[1043.12 - 1049.48] a lot of misery and a lot of anger there
[1046.52 - 1051.16] is a salad Kenny is preparing at home
[1049.48 - 1052.96] he's like very happy cut yeah he's
[1051.16 - 1054.32] grumbling at his nutritionist because
[1052.96 - 1056.88] his nutritionist asked him to prepare
[1054.32 - 1059.28] the food at home but over a period of
[1056.88 - 1062.80] time he's realized he's buying fresher
[1059.28 - 1065.40] food organic food and it's helping him
[1062.80 - 1068.16] few foods that improve pomegranate and
[1065.40 - 1069.32] the reason uh the reason I won a few
[1068.16 - 1072.00] Olympic
[1069.32 - 1074.40] medals when you swim and you get lactic
[1072.00 - 1076.92] acid and you get domes delayed onset of

[1224.24 - 1229.24] level
[1226.96 - 1233.00] omega3 if if you are a
[1229.24 - 1235.88] non-vegetarian salmon mackerel and chovi
[1233.00 - 1238.40] sea fish which are high in omega-3 River
[1235.88 - 1242.12] fish unfortunately not very high in
[1238.40 - 1245.72] omega-3 however those of you are
[1242.12 - 1251.56] vegetarian you get vegan omega3 which is
[1245.72 - 1254.36] the alal omega-3 but chia seed flax seed
[1251.56 - 1257.24] chia seed flax seed and walnuts have an
[1254.36 - 1258.76] amazing amount of Omega-3 in it why not
[1257.24 - 1260.04] blend it and put it into your protein
[1258.76 - 1262.96] powder
[1260.04 - 1264.88] smoothie now for those who come up to me
[1262.96 - 1269.00] and say sir we come from poor
[1264.88 - 1272.48] families I I've constructed 100 g of
[1269.00 - 1274.24] protein within 50 rupees 100 g of
[1272.48 - 1276.80] protein within 50
[1274.24 - 1282.24] rupees and this is the this is the
[1276.80 - 1285.92] equation oats 100 G Dalia 100 G gr FL
[1282.24 - 1288.76] 100 G soya chunks roasted gram and
[1285.92 - 1291.60] peanuts each one will give you
[1288.76 - 1292.88] approximately 13 g of protein the
[1291.60 - 1296.16] highest being
[1292.88 - 1300.32] soy so if you're a vegetarian and you
[1296.16 - 1302.56] have only 50 rupees even with food you
[1300.32 - 1305.12] can get your protein requirement so I'm
[1302.56 - 1307.36] wondering why everyone talks about
[1305.12 - 1311.08] protein supplements all the
[1307.36 - 1312.84] time yes you may need it post training
[1311.08 - 1314.84] but it's very
[1312.84 - 1318.92] important okay this is something I've
[1314.84 - 1323.36] created I call it R and noop
[1318.92 - 1326.44] swimmers don't have time to eat swimmers
[1323.36 - 1328.84] don't have time to eat so what is r and
[1326.44 - 1332.56] what is n so this is a creation i d
[1328.84 - 1333.76] because uh the players they could not
[1332.56 - 1336.64] they could not
[1333.76 - 1338.84] eat so uh let's say you're eating lunch
