Transcript: I didn't see you as a banker what was that moment where you went when my first student finished the class with me the only student in my class and she was just like this was so amazing and I'm coming [Music] back [Applause] [Music] today I thought about starting my episode with a transformative expert in the field of Fitness this person I've known for over two decades and I've invited into my home today I'm going to talk about how this person who I look up to I have hosted a radio show with her and she is a very very famous person to me this person is none other than scham we started a show together many years ago where we hosted early morning a radio show called The Fitness show and I I remember meeting her for the first time and the energy that came off her was amazing now she was not always a fitness instructor she was born in a place called kundapur which is somewhere in Karnataka and it has the most amazing casual I know this because she send them to be but her father was a banker she also became a banker herself she was for nearly 8 years working with HSBC but she moved on then to come into a journey where she took up Fitness as a new mantle shamri is one of the first people to form cultfit in India she's gone on to host many shows let's raise a glass today to this guest of mine she is a celebrity in her own right and with the new cheers let's get picking her brain shamri welcome to my show thank you so much cheers I may just have sneaked in some tequila there but thank you so much Ryan I think uh I must tell the audience that this is the first time we're doing a role reversal here all these years especially over the last decade I've been inviting Ryan for so many different podcasts and you know some new radio shows and stuff and this is fun because I get interviewed by you someone who I so look up to and someone has changed my life so I worked with you on uh your um CrossFit games yes I came to you to basically perform better in and let me tell you she is one of the fittest women in India uh I got third she got third place yeah and we were responsible me and my team at qu responsible for diet we were responsible maybe not for your marriage we'll talk about that we were responsible to help you out with your diet when you were when you were conceiving then during pregnan and then the weight loss and pregnancy so we went really really close so today I'm going to be interviewing about her life okay so are you ready for this yeah excited so let's start about your career you chose Finance okay and then suddenly because I don't see you as a banker yeah finance and and and fitness what was that moment where you went something snapped inside of you and said this is what I want to do for the rest of my life when my first student finished the class with me the only student in my class and she had this smile year to year and she was just like this was so amazing and I'm coming back so when you have a customer telling you that she enjoyed that class and she's coming back you know you've done something right and at that point I knew this was my purpose so I feel like Finance is something a lot of us can do uh being a great coach being able to help people change their lives is not something I don't know everybody can do I work with a lot of women you work with a lot of women and you're a role model for a lot of women in terms of family job career everything and keeping yourself fit yes were the childhood memories of you where you are a very fit person and then that carried on into your job and then ultimately now your career because very few people people have that motivation to continue to work out to continue to stay fit so from childhood was there a trigger or there was no trigger no no 100% I think I have to give a lot of credit to my parents but I've been active forever I'm 43 today and I started my first like I would say yoga actually with my father at age six so he had to incorporate a lot of uh movement and Fitness in his life because he got diagnosed with diabetes quite quite early uh and I think because of his sudden sedentary lifestyle from being super active and a sports Personality to being Sentry being at the bank so when he started his jogging in yoga I started with him and then there was no stopping so there was a lot of sports there was lot of uh Athletics there was lot of dancing and it just continued of course I went into sedentary mode also but it all started from when I was age six and it hasn't stopped and I'm hoping it doesn't stop until my last breath okay so so sham says she's 43 I don't believe she's a day over 26 and uh you know I have to I have to say this to you when I first started working with you on your nutrition you looked and your statistics made you much older but now when I look at your diet when I look at your blood test when I look at your skin today it's actually younger than when I met you 10 years ago yeah I I think I I would agree with that my body age is actually about the last time I checked with you while doing the test I think it was 30 or 31 so that makes her 13 years younger than her birth certificate age so um there's one lucky man right who has you 13 years younger but I didn't know about this and my team did the research and they came to me it's like sir she went on the dictat of her parents to meet many suitors in arranged marriage and I was like I did not know that about shamri so is it true that my research is correct that there were about many many suitors that were there that you went through you know I think a lot of um women coming from a typical middle class family in India would relate to this story where two decades ago arranged marriages just what you're supposed to do and I was fully open to it and but I didn't know it was going to get so hard so most of the uh memory of my 20s is very Bittersweet sweet is because I had a fantastic job at HSBC and I had great company to like you know go out with and just have a good time but every time I came home it was very stressful because it was always about meeting a potential groom and yeah I met close to 50 men over I guess four 5 6 years wasn't close to the idea yeah but then it got very very toxic after some point because either you're rejecting or they're rejecting and it just doesn't stop because your parents and your family won't stop and then you are at this Junction where you're like should I actually go out looking for myself or should I just go with the floow so there were moments where you know you just break down your family is breaking down with you since you're sharing here today um I have went through the similar cycle in my 30s where my father made an Excel sheet of shadi.com and he had this like yes no and I said yes to about 19 potential arranged marriages only to get a know back so I can understand how you know it's also stressed on the parents for a lot of parents out there trying to get uh their kids finding this future soulmate but um I met a husband a gem of a guy and U how did you meet him was he shi.com bat matrimony.com no so he's not even from the same Community like I'm a mangalorean he's not mangalorean he's a Malu so after meeting so many of your mangalorean community boys and when I presented a malali to my parents they were like they were like no no no this can't be happening but my friends arranged this marriage with B you know like our marriage I think they also got fed up of seeing me go through this whole torture and I I think this is for all the friends friends out there okay and this goes to my friend specifically you did not arrange my marriage but's friends arrang for the marri all the friends cheers to you guys you found her we okay jokes apart um let's talk about the concept of fitness and your life partner I think as a nutritionist I've seen people when they come for counseling if one partner is fit it's okay but if both Partners have the same vibrational liit it just your life just cruises into the next mode so for you how important is it to find the same rhythm in a life partner in everything that that is there I think it's everything because I don't know otherwise um so here's something I mean this is obviously I love my parents and no offense but you going to choose your parents true very you're born into you don't get to choose your parents you don't get to choose your children children children yes and your siblings you're right yeah so why I'm saying that is like you know whether your parents kind of help you pursue that talent that you have in you they find it and pursue it or they don't you will love them always you may just fight with them whatever whatever but you'll always love them like you can't check out of that relationship you can't check out and and I keep telling my dad even today that I wish you had seen the sports person in me I would have bought a medal for India and I know I think I'm fully capable of that you know me also and he laughs it off he's like you can focus on your daughter getting a medal for the country I said of course I'm going to do that but what I'm trying to say is that you don't get to choose your parents but to a large extent in today's Times you do get to choose your life partner and for me my life changed only after marriage I became the best version of me because of my husband he he helped me bring that out and I think without uh um his support and everything I I wouldn't be doing what I am doing today you know finding that purpose chasing Fitness changing people's lives helping people get better so I think the right Partners everything and I'm sure that's it's for you as well because I've seen your relationship with your wife and I think you both bring out the best in each other it's um very few people know this but uh you know I may be the celebrity nutritionist but um she's the spanner she's the works is the engine she's the generator exactly um the behind the scenes that happen I think if you are to succeed in a profession yes uh there is a give and take especially when you get into this world behind the cameras and there's a lot of demand and all and I just want to add this very quickly and I I'm not this is not to like create any expectations for anyone but uh when I finish maternity VI my husband chose to uh become a full-time father uh he quit whatever he was doing the startup that he was a part of only so that I can go back to work and do what I deeply love doing I don't know of any other man who has done such a big sacrifice for their spouse I'm not saying it's it's what men should do or women should do nobody needs to do any kind of sacrifices or compromises but it it's just what genuinely and to the guys out there you have to give more I do the groceries I do the shopping uh and my wife says your money is my money and my money is my money so let's let's go with it but I tell you if you find the right woman your life is much easier so uh the Hunt is difficult but I think there's a saying that I always say know coincidence is a pseudonym that the good Lord uses when he wants to remain Incognito yeah so I think you meeting VI is a coincident me meeting my spouse is a coincident and I think how you build and work on that in that and marriage is all about I believe compromise it's all about compromise you know um and speaking of marriage and then obviously the next subset is what all our parents want did your parents Hound you for a daughter or a son almost immediately yeah like a year into the M you I I got it on the on the night on the night we got married my mother-in-law said to me okay it's time for you to have kids yeah I think especially for people like I had a in Indian terms a late marriage getting married at 30 for a woman in especially in my family because all my cousins were getting married at age 23 24 uh and having started you know finding a boy from age 22 then getting married at 30 it was considered very late so yeah they gave me a year but a lot of inspiration she got married at 30 I married my wife at 34 she was 34 or we had a kid at 36 you need to train well you need to eat well if you're getting married late and having children late children speaking of children you have a bubbly daughter I love watching her videos thank there was there was one video where she says I forgot to grow taller was was that there like I forgot to grow taller I'm like why did you forget she looks at me she like because I forgot like why would you ask such a question and I can see her doing workouts with you and stuff that uh you mentioned a point that your father said make your daughter a champion you have all the right templates as a fitness person as a fitness mom as a fitness wife uh and that's part of your career yeah uh but it inves a lot people think it's very easy but it's a lot of investment like you can't Outsource your work out to somebody yeah what are the things you're doing with your daughter to ensure that she has a life that gets her ready for the future first and foremost I'm teaching her to eat right because I've had a great relationship with food in the sense my parents always ensure I ate home so so do you think it's important that parents lead by example the way they eat 100% okay I must say this like I have a sweet too and I probably eat you know something sweet more often than I should and I actually hide while I'm eating if she's around because I don't want her to see me because I've built a phenomenal routine for her with her food and a lot of which I've learned from you and I know that a few years from now when she's ready to like you know uh do a lot more the only first person I would come to is you for her nutrition and everything else but the most important thing to teach your child at a very young age is to eat right and I will say this she's 3 years old and when when I give her a cupcake which is only on the weekends and on a birthday because then she there's there's a significance like she's Associated that with a celebration she'll eat half of it and then she'll just give me the rest and she'll say I'm done and I think this relationship that she's also built with food and what she would choose to eat more is cucumbers and beetroots and carrots and you know what I mean like and this is my first Focus the decision to put her into the particular daycare that she goes to was after looking at their menu so I feel like food can be medicine food can be poison and you've taught me all of that very well in the last decade and I want to be able to teach my child that movement comes to her naturally because she sees her mom and do Mom and Dad jump around all the time lift weights so she does it on her own movement eating right kindness these are the few things that I'm trying my best to teach her so family is crucial to use what I can see your daughter is the center of your Universe what's your normal day like starts at about 5: 4:45 5 in the morning uh you always got up at 5:00 in the morning no it's only post my daughter otherwise I was a I would wake up early for a class not for my own workout to teach others but now post a baby I realize like the only other time I have is morning so first thing out of my way is my own workout because there's literally no other time that you'll find because once you're a so are you saying that this is key to all the women out there which is we need to focus on ourselves first 100% with how do you take care of a family if you are not able to take care of yourself how are you going to be strong enough mentally physically emotionally you know for your family you need to be strong first and only then like and you know I hear because I do so many female clients that they say that oh but I my husband oh but my children oh but my job always oh there's always an oh which is why you have to wake up at 4:45 if you have to get it done so you're awake at 4:45 you work out then what happens and then I come back home uh I have a very supportive husband who's already gotten you know the little one ready uh so I go and do my little bit sometimes I'm not even there I I miss that time and he's already taken her off to school uh and drops it off and then it's your usual you know shower breakfast work work work work work and then I'm trying very often to ensure I'm there at 400 p.m. to pick her up so my window to work is between like 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. to get more stuff done so that 4 p.m. when I picked her up I spend at least couple of hours with her playing reading all of that you all cook together no I don't cook much does she does she like to prepare stuff pretend play pretend I think that's an important thing that like I do smoothies or pancakes with my kid and you get lesser resistant from the child if they have contributed to a preparation of something especially novel foods and a quick tip children will refuse a food for up to 11 to 12 exposures before their pette begins to accept it right so mothers shamri don't give up till you have had 12 or 13 attempts of exposure with something off of food I think a great uh takeaway you've launched many gyms and you're part of cfit as a fitness expert you're a dance instructor um you've coordinated show so many shows and everything how do you convince people how do you convince women that muscle is important I always say muscle is an age reversible organ yeah but obviously you meet them in your class you do dance but you encourage them to do resistance training so what's your take on on muscle for women I say the same thing that you say by the way that muscle is the only age reversible organ in the body and I think more than anything else um we want to age gracefully right aging gracefully is is denied to most people like I look at my own parents today and I'm like they're they're 70 they've been fairly active all their life Etc but they don't have the strength so being active and you know not not having the strength when you're at 70 doesn't match doesn't make sense but if you build enough strength by doing the right amount of resistance training weight training at least two to three times a week you are going to be able to age gracefully I mean you need the muscle mass you need your joints to function better you need a strong posterior chain to be able to walk without losing balance at 70 75 80 right but you know we keep saying this to our parents you need to weit train and stuff like that and I think nobody told that to them in their 20s 30s and 40s so they cannot develop a new skill set in their 50s and 60s I agree but even at 50s and 60s to start doing some unilateral training and V training it's not too late amazing impact yes in fact I would like to share with people there was this uh scientific research done which was these old age people they put them in a home yeah and in one part of the home they gave them board games and in another part of the uh old age they gave them a gym resistant training chiefly leg extension 6 months later they did the biopsy of the two groups the board game group and the knee extension group who did exercise and they found that muscle regressed by 6 years at the age of 72 so I think it's very key to understand that um we have to encourage women to work out and you're a living proof example of it whil you publicly told us your age is 43 yes but her metabolic age is one so she's far a decade younger and I meet so many women in the clinic and that's why I was so inspired to have scham is my first female guest on board because the paradigm shift is that women need to take care of their bodies yes they cannot have an excuse of husband children career yeah and our hormones you you yeah we have only one hormone testosterone you have multiple hormones exactly if you want to like really keep that balance with the hormones and Etc there's nothing better than weight training nothing better than weight training and also training according to your cycle so on and so forth there's like there's we can go into depth of that later but every woman must pick up weights and it doesn't have to be heavy light or heavy the choice is ours we figure over a period of Time how important is it to have a personal trainer well it depends on a goal I think having a personal trainer is phenomen nomenal it can really change the way you train because you would have seen a version of yourself which you wouldn't otherwise see in a group class because here the focus is just you right the trainer is trying to get the best out of you so I think everyone can experience getting a personal trainer to really identify what they're capable of and to have all the you know the right correction guidance postural changes and Etc but since personal training is expensive I would say even if you do you know group classes but if you weight train how often do you weit train every day you weit train every day is Sunday a rest day Sunday is yeah rest I try to do some Mobility on Sunday at home with my daughter uh she's just I mean I do it she just jumps jumps in but um Saturday mostly would be a long run because I enjoy running and I feel like the human body is naturally designed to run so we can't kind of lose that you know ability and mobility and everything so weight training is something that's that's it should be non-negotiable for all women uh not just from a strength point of view because personally for me it's made me a very confident person nothing no education no you know different types of jobs has been able to give me the confidence that weight training has given me so yeah it just boosts your confidence five workouts that you would give any woman out there watching five workouts like she does doesn't have time she has 20 minutes in the day yeah five exercises that she could do maybe five workouts is the wrong thing yeah excise five exercises plank it's what your core and your spine really needs so it's mandatory and how much should a person hold a plank honestly even 45 seconds 60 seconds is more than enough I mean we don't want anyone to hold for 10 minutes and 5 minutes it's not a challenge right you do a 30 to 45 seconds plan Plank and repeat like 3 to five and what should be the rest in between 15 seconds 15 seconds yeah okay more than enough 15 that's one what squats foundational movement especially if you can learn to deep squat if you practice about 10 minutes of deep Squat and you can accumulate there's there's one Instagram video of you talking about this even from a constipation point of view bow movement point of view and everything yes it's what we if you notice a toddler an infant to a toddler when they move squatting deep squatting is the first movement you know I want to share something with you and share with all the women out there I recently went for a wellness Retreat and there were phenomenal number of women over there and we were doing a yoga class where we had to go into a squat Po and I can tell you without a doubt about 80% of the women were not squatting properly they were on their toes or they were half squatted but they couldn't get into a deep squat so I think this is something that's crucial that women if you can't squat well and hold that position and then get up we need to really work on this with your trainer yes with you practicing it on a daily basis what's the third exercise okay squat plank lunges because lunges allows you to focus on balance and stability which is what you need as you age because as we age we lose balance and stability because it's a single leg movement it allows you to focus on balance and stability and excellent for your glue for your butt butt being the largest muscle and we know how we need to keep it really strong uh also recent some studies show about how your posterior training especially your glutes and your hips can help in longevity because you're going to avoid more Falls and stuff like that so lunges right uh something that can take the heart rate up and can give you a you know a great quick cardio activity burpees it's my favorite Yona does my little one does burpees like with the finest technique and she learned it on her own but burpees is phenomenal for a quick burst of cardio you know you suddenly hit like zone three zone four come back so it's phenomenal the last exercise I don't know if this is an exercise but I feel every human being must walk more I was about to add this as my sixth one came in so yes we've got walking tell us about walking and why oh my God I mean it's just what we're supposed to do I know we could have done this podcast also walking but then there'll be too much distraction but walking is just something you're supposed to do and walking is best for fat loss I mean so many people struggling out there to Fat Loss you eat right you walk a lot you'll see that fat kind of melting away right it's one of your best zone two training and we all need to do zone two training almost every day so it's the finest Zone to training it's what the body is designed to do like we say sitting is is the new smoking yeah awesome and I always tell people that when I worked with the film stars one prescription to all of them is please walk and they look at me very quizzically but to fat burn when you are walking your heart rate is in that targeted Zone where the substrate utilization meaning the source of fuel inside your body is not glycogen from the muscle which is the carb but actually fat the higher you go in your heart rate the more is glycogen as a fuel or a Battery Source the lower the intensity the more the fat you burn which is why we have something known as neat non exercise adaptive thermogenesis which is sh what your mother and what my mother and our grandparents did which is being fidgety around the house and cleaning and cooking and jaru and POA which is why a lot of you in the pandemic lost weight because the housekeeping didn't turn up so you were fidgeting you were constantly on the Move now speaking of constantly on the move you are one of the fittest moms in the country per se it's it's is the fittest mom she's got a Ryan fando Chapan approval on that any any three advices that you would give uh to moms about the nutrition that you do I know I'm the nutritionist but what would you tell people to do from a nutrition point of view after working with me for almost a decade eat more protein because Mom especially oh my God during that whole breastfeeding phase and Etc it's so important and then when you want to lose weight after that it's so important eat more protein uh so it's only nutrition advice you want to know give us exercise also yeah walk more walk walk walk remember when when you delivered y I said just walk walk walk you told me 15,000 steps yeah like I'm I'm a dance instructor I'm a fitness instructor I'm like you're going to walk cuz walk is so important for that post pregnancy weight loss and especially for women who do not have a natural delivery then trying to get into hardcore workouts that scham started almost instantaneously walking is better for the first month a month and a half till your body re acclimatizes back in yes yes do your do your blood tests more often if needed because I think your hormones are all over the place because mentally you're disturbed emotionally you're disturbed physically there's been a tornado in the body so I think I did it every 3 or 4 months at that phase at one year postpartum so the blood test really helped me ensure that I'm not getting deficient anywhere and I'm constantly you know fueling it or refueling and last but not least uh Community I feel like the community angle which most people don't talk about is so critical if you if you have ever attended a shamri Glo class you will understand the meaning of community to the next level I came out of a class once vibrating because there was so much of banter exchange motivation go you go girl you go you can do it and stuff like that I I remember that yeah I think Community like this is a show that I feel everyone should watch I think it's on Netflix it's called LIF to 100 and it talks about all the blue zones where we have centenarians and they spoke about how you know movement and food and the third thing being community contributes to longevity relationships yeah relationships exactly what are the top foods that if you met your friends you were eating with them having this relationship with them what would you eat and you're not speaking to your nutritionist now you're speaking to a talk show host and uh tell us oh my God okay uh I know you love your glass of wine yeah I do I like my wine sometimes I like my beer so uh I don't I don't overdo it but I don't like compromise on it either uh I do the Sweet Tooth yeah the Sweet Tooth comes in the end and that also I don't I com I don't compromise I mean you know sometimes I'm like you work so hard you work out harder the you should be able to enjoy a few things in life and then you know I I love fries but I really control but I do enjoy a little bit I also love fries yeah yeah but if there is like a big bowl of fries I probably would count and not have more than like 10 fries you know what I mean so I think sham is more disciplined than me when it comes to french fries oh my God so happy to hear that but yeah it's it's tough when you're out you have a kid I have a kid our kids are these days normally engrossed in their devices how important is it for our children to be physically active when should they be physically active and how can parents and encourage their children to form a routine and go in that direction yeah I think I can say a lot now because I have a child and I watch her I think being Physically Active is everything for children everything they they should just be active all times and I would just tell all the you know listeners who have children that it's not about Fitness don't worry about your child's Fitness just ensure that your child is playing a sport most important either they are just running around you know in in the apartment building or in the Park or wherever they are or you have to identify one sport that they kind of enjoy doing they don't need to love it they may just change every two years what they love but I feel every child in this country maybe in this world should play a sport a sport that they kind of like for as long as they want to it's a movement and like I mean I definitely want to start my child at age 4 uh Age 4 is a good time to start certain types of activities like ballet will be age4 age5 gymnastics you can start from age four and I feel it's a great Foundation to have for most children gymnastics and then after that they can pick up a sport that they like I mean there's so many options today so many ways to you know be active build a routine right one is identify what sport and what are the different things they want to do second is build a routine you they come back from school like okay I'll tell you what my routine is right of course the kids have no time in the morning they wake up and go to you know daycare School wherever my child comes back she has a little snack and then soon after that for the next 1 hour it's play time and it could be anything it could be cycling it could be just running around going to the park sliding down up in whatever it is players players sport do an activity which is physical in nature for an hour or so right if they want to do more great do more and then you can then I do some reading like for about 30 minutes 40 minutes max we do some reading and then we do dinner and we go to bed and the routine is such where screen time is only given on Saturday and Sunday and this is something we built we built from the beginning so there is no screen time on other days at all unless of course we've gone out for dinner on a weekday and then the child is getting supremely bored in an adult conversation then you don't don't have a choice you have to engage them in some other way so yeah it's snack physical play some mental thing with reading drawing doing some puzzles dinner and bedtime reading and sleep Saturday Sunday about 2 hours of scream time and a lot of play through the day so I feel just you have to be active for that too so you have to be strong and you know you should have the ability to run around with a child because sometimes you live in spaces where you don't have too many kids to play around with uh but there are so many activities for kids today it's phenomenal like I took my child uh bould ring you know the rock climbing it's mostly for adults but then they had a small section where you can just learn and she loved it and then I took her and her friends so you have to experiment what's out there sports awesome so you're talking about children getting more physically active yes what about if somebody their parents like my parents wanted me to only study and not have any physical activity who never worked out so a lot of our listeners have never worked out so somebody who's never done a workout what would your advice be okay I'll say something and uh how to start yeah start with an activity your child thoroughly enjoys doing that's the most important identify put them into two three different activities and see what they like and let's build on that don't force the child to do what you want them to do identify what they like because they'll probably like five different things right but one you can stick and with the adults you know what this is something I read recently Ryan that you may not have come from a very healthy family and you know you don't have uh a healthy way of living but at least let the person that's come out of you learn how to be healthy change the Next Generation yes change the Next Generation so a little bit for you you as a parent is your child is watching you all the time and learning from you so even if you're a little active it will make a world of a different whether you're active with the child playing with them or at least being around them when they're doing you know some activity can help trous I have a joke to share with everyone including you so my son does karate he's 10 years old and I've gone back to karate after many years yeah and the first belt is yellow belt now I've been at yellow belt for one year okay because I'm doing I'm doing and my sense I says you need to change it my cheeky son comes up to me and says Papa you've been having yellow belt for the full year now I am getting inspired by my kid because he's watching me yes trying to get fit but also proding and poking so I think it's a two-way street if you as an adult start some physical activity your child is looking at you and your child is also then motivating you or kind of poking you that you know you need to get on to the next belt of Life absolutely my child is saying she wants to do uh skateboarding she's seen it on TV or somewhere do you know that skateboarding is an Olympic sport yes it is so I will I will do her ntion plan for the Olympics maybe I'll get a gold medal with L okay that's a promise okay not with skateboarding but with something gold medal speaking of hard work has there been one client's life one story that you can share with people that was truly inspirational or motivation to you or the world you know uh okay so there are a lot of stories that I can talk about but most of which revolve around uh fat loss weight loss you know and you and I both know that's a combination of many things but what I actually want to talk about is Lifestyle Changes right I feel that's really hard I have clients who don't really need weight loss but these are people who I work with and what I see that they need is movement in their life right like some sort of exercise some movement and these are also like especially one particular woman I'm talking about a hardcore party animal if there is some term like that right like their weekends or even week days are all about going out having a great time and then waking up next morning and working working working working hard farting harder you know changing someone like that who actually doesn't have a goal there is no weight loss goal nothing but I wanted to change her lifestyle and she want wanted it too today it's been a year actually she of course works out every single day she's been phenomenal benefits but when she tells me that I now go to bed at 10:30 versus 1:00 a.m. and 2 a.m. I now even look forward to working out on weekends and I also look forward to working out when I travel she's like I don't know this person existed she's looking at herself and she's saying that I didn't even know this was possible for me those kind of success story that that is for me a success story because honestly weight loss may be a longest one but it's possible we both know that it's so so changing the avar changing the avar of the person completely and there's a lot of research coming in behind this in terms of the brain neurotrophic Factor changing so from from that perspective when the gut microbiome changes that's what we need to focus on corre uh when you bring in more exercise you you deliver more bacteria which caus you to change your sense of wellbeing yes so that bacteria now says I want more of it like a drug the same goes for when we do it with sugar or alcohol or drugs the bacteria changes and releases certain molecules which go into your brain and form formative behaviors but speaking of behaviors there's one thing where you have a voluntary consumption of good or bad habits yeah but what if people don't have a choice like people who are in corporate India in late night shifts right they don't have a choice my brother is an example for the last two decades he's worked the night shift I can see that it's a difficult shift I can see that it takes a toll on the health so from an exercise point of view as a fitness expert what is the advice you give to a lot of people that come to you for workouts okay I must tell you this that I used to do a night shift Once Upon a Time right and it was horrible like if I had to go back I wouldn't do it but I've done it and I know but the only thing that I did and it was a proper night ship one thing that kept me going from a physical activity point of view during that phase was dance so I continued to do a lot of dancing and that was my way of moving and being fit and I did it for about 30 40 minutes every day so for people out there who you know who have you know difficult hours at work who struggle I would say it's okay if you don't go to the gym absolutely okay you don't get fit only when you go to the gym try to walk more often and try to pick a workout time that works for you it doesn't have to be a morning it doesn't have to be an evening especially if you're a night shift person what works for you is maybe waking up you know get some good sleep and waking up and doing a physical activity at home or going out for a jog or a walk start really slow so getting a workout at home do or play a sport absolutely anything you enjoy and do it at a time that works for you don't push yourself to do it at a time that someone's told you to do it that works the best and that's what worked for me I danced and I danced when I could so if you want to get in touch with
