Transcript: most of these apps most of these startups where the nutrition is led by technology is wrong in today's Dage maybe 3 4 5 years from now when AI really gets into the bio individuality of a person then it'll be correct so let me give an example most of these apps are funded they are driven is very difficult to invest in technology and get a standardized diet chart created for 10 or 15 patients that walk in every day but what these apps do is they target thousands of people they give one diet chart claimed to be done by artificial intelligence but let me tell you something unless you're capturing your blood test unless you're capturing your food recall your cultural recall your genetic test maybe if you have a little bit more money your microbiome or your gut analysis bacteria test and your omega-3 testing and put all of this together you are actually getting a standardized diet plan but this is good I say that all these apps are really good because at least people are having awareness K by let me at least start something at least here these apps are giving me something of a timetable what to eat when to eat and how much to eat I think if people start that it gets them to a nice place
