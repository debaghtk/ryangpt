[119.46 - 125.76] in video making
[121.16 - 127.80] then mention what you do better still I
[125.76 - 128.70] would advise you to make a video of
[127.80 - 131.46] yourself
[128.70 - 133.92] and introduce yourself that shows your
[131.46 - 136.56] ability to send me a video script make a
[133.92 - 138.60] video get it onto the internet
[136.56 - 139.92] compress it and send it across to me
[138.60 - 142.62] which means I know you're technically
[139.92 - 144.30] Savvy these are small things that you
[142.62 - 147.36] can do and when you make that video
[144.30 - 149.76] please don't be in t-shirt
[147.36 - 152.10] It's always important that you present
[149.76 - 153.90] yourself to the world very well you
[152.10 - 156.18] don't turn up for your wedding in
[153.90 - 158.34] Choppers and shorts
[156.18 - 160.20] why do you do the same at your workplace
[158.34 - 163.08] why do you do the same for your job
[160.20 - 166.50] interview Food For Thought India Food
[163.08 - 168.62] For Thought for 1.3 billion of us who
[166.50 - 171.56] are trying to upgrade our level of Life
[168.62 - 174.90] upgrade your resume by being truthful
[171.56 - 177.66] upgrade your resume by being genuine in
[174.90 - 179.82] your communication upgrade Yourself by
[177.66 - 182.22] knowing whom you're going to lunch with
[179.82 - 184.62] whom you are applying with I had a
[182.22 - 185.94] candidate once who met me for a lunch
[184.62 - 188.22] interview
[185.94 - 190.56] and had not even had the courtesy to
[188.22 - 192.72] review our website do you think I
[190.56 - 195.36] recruited that person
[192.72 - 197.88] if you are not showing the intention in
[195.36 - 200.40] a job interview I definitely know you
[197.88 - 202.98] never have a job intention to work and
[200.40 - 205.44] stay in a company where you want to grow
[202.98 - 207.06] with the company so think about that and
[205.44 - 209.52] this is from an entrepreneur's heart
[207.06 - 213.06] straight to you and if I do get trolled
[209.52 - 215.16] for this so be it we need manners we
[213.06 - 217.68] need careful thinkers to apply for jobs
[215.16 - 220.26] because if you don't do it artificial
[217.68 - 222.48] intelligence is replacing all of us
[220.26 - 226.62] including me the celebrity nutritionist
[222.48 - 229.74] so the basic human skill set is human
[226.62 - 231.96] emotion human interaction human common
[229.74 - 235.46] sense I wish you all the best and I hope
[231.96 - 235.46] you come and do work with us
