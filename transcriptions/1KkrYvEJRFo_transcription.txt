[0.16 - 3.76] what's the best time to take a
[1.48 - 6.20] supplement for maximum absorption this
[3.76 - 8.56] is part one let's start first with the
[6.20 - 12.04] vitamins the water soluble are the B
[8.56 - 15.28] complexes B1 B2 B6 B9 B12 in all of them
[12.04 - 17.44] and vitamin C best had early morning for
[15.28 - 19.08] the best absorption well some of you
[17.44 - 21.08] might get a little bit of acidity on an
[19.08 - 23.24] empty stomach I suggest then you do it
[21.08 - 25.88] post breakfast and then we have the
[23.24 - 28.28] vitamin d a e and K which are fat
[25.88 - 30.12] soluble now they need healthy fats from
[28.28 - 32.52] your diet to help in the absorption so
[30.12 - 35.16] one of my favorites is avocado combine
[32.52 - 37.68] your fat solubles with avocado and you
[35.16 - 39.48] could also do nuts and seeds vitamin D
[37.68 - 41.96] is the sunshine vitamin try not to take
[39.48 - 44.08] it at the night time fat solubles again
[41.96 - 46.20] are best had in the first half of the
[44.08 - 50.20] day and then you have the minerals
[46.20 - 53.32] calcium and iron very important note
[50.20 - 55.24] calcium should be taken with a meal iron
[53.32 - 57.88] don't take it on a meal take it on an
[55.24 - 61.92] empty stomach a word of caution do not
[57.88 - 61.92] take calcium and iron together
