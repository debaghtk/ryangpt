[1.20 - 5.92] hi good morning my name is ryan fernando
[3.76 - 7.28] and you and i today are going to walk
[5.92 - 9.04] through your gut
[7.28 - 10.88] this is a video for all the people who
[9.04 - 13.20] have any indigestion gas
[10.88 - 14.64] bloating irritable bowel syndrome
[13.20 - 16.80] constipation
[14.64 - 19.28] or anything related to your gut and your
[16.80 - 20.88] brain including anxiety and depression
[19.28 - 23.04] so i want to talk to you about the gut
[20.88 - 26.08] system which starts from the mouth
[23.04 - 27.92] goes down to your esophagus which is the
[26.08 - 30.48] pipeline that goes down the stomach
[27.92 - 31.76] a lot of us have h pylori bacteria
[30.48 - 34.00] acidity
[31.76 - 35.12] uh you know uh ulcers and then you go
[34.00 - 36.64] down into the
[35.12 - 38.08] small intestine where you're not
[36.64 - 40.00] supposed to have too much of bacteria
[38.08 - 42.32] and you get what is known as sibo
[40.00 - 43.92] small intestinal bacterial overgrowth so
[42.32 - 45.84] a lot of belching and burping which
[43.92 - 47.28] should not technically happen
[45.84 - 49.04] and then you go down to large intestine
[47.28 - 51.20] where your microbiome it's all the
[49.04 - 53.28] bacteria and all that get completely go
[51.20 - 54.72] haywire and stuff like that and you come
[53.28 - 56.32] down to your poop canal
[54.72 - 58.80] where your potty is there you have
[56.32 - 59.36] constipation you have loose motions you
[58.80 - 61.20] have
[59.36 - 62.56] incomplete bowel evacuation and
[61.20 - 65.84] everything from
[62.56 - 67.52] piles fistila hemorrhoids all related to
[65.84 - 69.60] an entire system called the
[67.52 - 71.36] gastrointestinal system so today i want
[69.60 - 74.24] to share with you a report
[71.36 - 75.20] which is all about the microbiome now
[74.24 - 76.72] going forward
[75.20 - 78.40] what i want to do is i want to give you
[76.72 - 80.08] a few insight and
[78.40 - 81.44] if you don't like this video please skip
[80.08 - 83.60] and go away but
[81.44 - 85.28] everybody has a gut system everybody
[83.60 - 87.20] needs to have this education and this
[85.28 - 89.52] knowledge so bear with me with this
[87.20 - 92.64] short video as i educate you on how
[89.52 - 94.32] you can do a crystal ball gazing into
[92.64 - 96.08] your future of your gut
[94.32 - 97.92] which means i'm the astrologer of your
[96.08 - 100.24] gut except this is not
[97.92 - 101.52] hearsay this is scientific now you have
[100.24 - 104.48] 30 trillion
[101.52 - 105.52] cells in the human body related to your
[104.48 - 107.84] rbcs
[105.52 - 109.44] but you have 40 trillion cells which are
[107.84 - 110.40] related to your bacteria so are you
[109.44 - 113.44] bacteria
[110.40 - 114.16] are you a microorganism or your human
[113.44 - 116.64] organism
[114.16 - 118.08] so i do believe that over centuries of
[116.64 - 121.68] evolution
[118.08 - 124.72] we are well evolved to work
[121.68 - 128.00] with the bacteria in nature however
[124.72 - 130.56] with a lot of our industrialization a
[128.00 - 132.24] septic living a lot of chemicals
[130.56 - 135.68] sanitizers
[132.24 - 138.48] pesticides insecticides and also
[135.68 - 139.60] uh antibiotics and things like that we
[138.48 - 142.64] have upset
[139.60 - 143.92] the gut micro of microflora now i want
[142.64 - 147.12] to give you a few insights
[143.92 - 150.96] women are two times as likely to susa to
[147.12 - 154.72] to to suffer from gut issues
[150.96 - 156.96] okay 62 percent of people worldwide
[154.72 - 159.52] suffer from complaints such as digestion
[156.96 - 162.40] constipation i work with children
[159.52 - 164.24] children between the ages of 9 and 16
[162.40 - 166.24] cannot communicate or are too
[164.24 - 168.08] embarrassed to tell their parents
[166.24 - 169.52] that they are constipated parents are
[168.08 - 171.04] too busy in their jobs to figure out
[169.52 - 171.52] that the children are not pooping on
[171.04 - 173.68] time
[171.52 - 176.00] i keep a record of when my kid goes to
[173.68 - 177.44] poop i sometimes tell him don't flush i
[176.00 - 178.64] want to look at your poop and then as
[177.44 - 179.92] you get older
[178.64 - 182.80] you know when you go to work you get
[179.92 - 184.16] people which who come in very angry
[182.80 - 185.84] if you don't clear your bowel in the
[184.16 - 187.44] morning you're going to be angry and the
[185.84 - 189.20] fault is the parent for not training
[187.44 - 191.20] that kid to have an early morning
[189.20 - 192.96] ball movement so then you know your
[191.20 - 196.08] circadian rhythm which is the
[192.96 - 198.00] body clock to the sunset and sunrise
[196.08 - 199.60] and your poop clock go completely
[198.00 - 201.84] misaligned 95
[199.60 - 203.68] of serotonin serotonin is what makes you
[201.84 - 206.56] happy serotonin is what makes you calm
[203.68 - 208.24] is synthesized in the gut believe me the
[206.56 - 209.52] number of cases that i get and i'm
[208.24 - 211.44] counseling people and you're sitting
[209.52 - 213.36] across me in zoom or in my
[211.44 - 214.80] nutritional counseling room i can tell
[213.36 - 217.04] you within five minutes
[214.80 - 219.36] whether your your gut is gone just by
[217.04 - 221.60] the words you use
[219.36 - 222.64] people who use positive words have a
[221.60 - 224.80] happy gut
[222.64 - 227.44] so we gotta change your gut to a microbe
[224.80 - 229.20] microbiome good microbiome okay
[227.44 - 230.48] and all of this corona and covered in
[229.20 - 232.64] all everyone's talking about
[230.48 - 234.24] yeah let's put kara let's put vitamin c
[232.64 - 236.08] let's put everything
[234.24 - 237.92] if you can strengthen your gut and i've
[236.08 - 239.28] got secrets to strengthen your gut in
[237.92 - 241.12] today's thing
[239.28 - 243.28] the world is giving a lot of general
[241.12 - 245.84] tips today's video
[243.28 - 247.84] i am talking about the gut microbiome
[245.84 - 248.88] and how do you reprogram it but before
[247.84 - 252.00] you reprogram it
[248.88 - 252.72] you got to test it okay so what could be
[252.00 - 254.96] the
[252.72 - 256.24] things with the microbiome okay so the
[254.96 - 258.24] entire gut
[256.24 - 260.00] could have things gut means stomach
[258.24 - 262.16] small intestine large intestine
[260.00 - 263.60] colon rectum so everything okay you
[262.16 - 264.72] could have gas bloating you could have
[263.60 - 268.16] mental issues
[264.72 - 271.04] brain fog i remember once when um
[268.16 - 271.36] i i did not know that i had an allergy
[271.04 - 273.36] to
[271.36 - 275.36] gluten and dairy i remember i could do
[273.36 - 277.28] like four or five hours of counseling
[275.36 - 278.80] i would always have this brain fog and
[277.28 - 280.24] you know find it difficult so i've
[278.80 - 282.88] always had a dietitian
[280.24 - 283.92] with me like an assist to help me when i
[282.88 - 285.68] my mind starts
[283.92 - 288.64] brain fogging up so this is a public
[285.68 - 290.80] confession right but when i went and
[288.64 - 291.68] did my dna test for gluten and lactose
[290.80 - 294.24] it disappeared
[291.68 - 295.04] so vitamin and mineral deficiencies do
[294.24 - 297.12] you know that
[295.04 - 298.16] the intestine is a beautiful pipeline
[297.12 - 300.56] with lovely
[298.16 - 302.08] uh carpets inside that absorb all the
[300.56 - 303.92] nutrients and i'm doing my fingers like
[302.08 - 305.52] this because they are micro villis
[303.92 - 307.28] so when you eat the wrong foods your
[305.52 - 308.96] beautiful carpet finger like production
[307.28 - 310.80] becomes stubs
[308.96 - 313.04] and so all the nutrition instead of
[310.80 - 314.72] going through and getting caught and
[313.04 - 315.52] absorbed the micro nutrients of vitamins
[314.72 - 317.12] and minerals
[315.52 - 319.12] you get these stubs so all the nutrient
[317.12 - 321.60] just bounces off in your intestine and
[319.12 - 322.32] washes out so you have loose tools loose
[321.60 - 324.32] poop
[322.32 - 326.00] think of it if you have loose explosive
[324.32 - 327.28] uh poop and you don't have beautifully
[326.00 - 328.88] formed stool
[327.28 - 331.12] most of your nutrition is not getting
[328.88 - 332.16] absorbed autoimmune disorders alopecia
[331.12 - 334.64] areata
[332.16 - 336.72] to psoriasis eczema people say so i got
[334.64 - 339.60] psoriasis i got eczema arya beta
[336.72 - 341.28] you take your skin and turn it inside my
[339.60 - 342.08] skin on the outside i turn it inside
[341.28 - 344.40] that's my skin
[342.08 - 345.84] inside my gut if you have skin gut
[344.40 - 347.20] problems inside it's going to show on
[345.84 - 349.76] your outside skin
[347.20 - 353.04] so everything from dandruff to psoriasis
[349.76 - 355.04] to xemia to vitiligo to dry chicken skin
[353.04 - 356.88] i had a lady yesterday saying to me my
[355.04 - 357.76] skin is looking amazing just one week on
[356.88 - 360.24] your diet
[357.76 - 360.88] because we are aligning the gut so a lot
[360.24 - 364.16] of over
[360.88 - 364.80] uh over abuse of you know antibiotics
[364.16 - 366.72] and stress
[364.80 - 368.80] i can't i can't tell you i can't
[366.72 - 370.72] document stress
[368.80 - 372.72] so the problem is if i can't document
[370.72 - 373.12] stress then i scratch my head and say
[372.72 - 375.00] hey
[373.12 - 376.32] you know what let me go and check your
[375.00 - 379.92] microbiome
[376.32 - 381.68] so i feel microbiome is the entire
[379.92 - 383.04] population in your gut all of these
[381.68 - 385.20] bacterias and
[383.04 - 386.88] good guys and the back guys and maybe
[385.20 - 387.84] fungal overgrowth and yeast overgrowth
[386.88 - 389.60] and all of this
[387.84 - 391.12] juggernaut that is like one full city
[389.60 - 393.28] inside your in your in your body and i
[391.12 - 395.68] said it's 40 trillion okay
[393.28 - 397.52] do you need a gut reset so so basically
[395.68 - 399.44] from my perspective
[397.52 - 401.04] to explain to you in very very simple
[399.44 - 403.20] terms you have good bacteria
[401.04 - 404.48] and you have bad bacteria imagine the
[403.20 - 407.44] good bacteria getting
[404.48 - 409.28] that pav bhaji that you ate or that
[407.44 - 410.16] celery that you ate or that carrot that
[409.28 - 413.20] you ate
[410.16 - 414.56] or simple dal chawal roti and the good
[413.20 - 416.56] bacteria says wow
[414.56 - 418.00] let's eat this and we'll produce happy
[416.56 - 419.60] molecules let's produce
[418.00 - 422.96] breakdown of these molecules and give it
[419.60 - 424.48] to the blood the bad bacteria say
[422.96 - 426.40] we are going to ferment this and create
[424.48 - 428.48] some disco molecules in your body and
[426.40 - 430.40] those disco molecules go into your blood
[428.48 - 432.00] and create a disco effect in your body
[430.40 - 433.68] now this might not be good disco
[432.00 - 435.20] that might this might be a lot of bad
[433.68 - 437.20] disco okay
[435.20 - 439.12] so at the end of the day you need to
[437.20 - 440.56] understand when you were younger you
[439.12 - 442.68] didn't have gut problem
[440.56 - 444.56] because this slide is showing you the
[442.68 - 446.72] diversity of
[444.56 - 448.80] the organisms the bacteria dates
[446.72 - 450.80] formicatous actinobacter
[448.80 - 452.88] these are the ratios on how the bacteria
[450.80 - 454.64] could be you will be shocked when i
[452.88 - 456.88] start showing you the microbiome report
[454.64 - 460.72] how people's things go haywire
[456.88 - 463.68] second point anybody above the age of 50
[460.72 - 465.68] has to do the microbiome test trust me
[463.68 - 466.40] it's the greatest gift you can give to
[465.68 - 468.80] your parents
[466.40 - 471.28] what do i do i need a poop sample poop
[468.80 - 473.44] sample is collected put into a container
[471.28 - 475.48] sent to a lab to me here in bangalore
[473.44 - 477.84] and then we do the dna
[475.48 - 479.52] fingerprinting of the population of
[477.84 - 481.68] bacteria in you
[479.52 - 482.80] i am working right now with an 82 year
[481.68 - 485.12] old person
[482.80 - 487.44] and we are trying to change his entire
[485.12 - 489.84] gut microbiome which is in dysbiosis
[487.44 - 490.56] dysbiosis means it's it's not in good
[489.84 - 492.80] control
[490.56 - 494.40] so let me let me show you the microbiome
[492.80 - 495.92] report okay so this is the microbiome
[494.40 - 497.84] report
[495.92 - 499.92] and and basically this is what we'll get
[497.84 - 502.56] you know there's a gut microbiome index
[499.92 - 503.76] the abundance so let me quickly show you
[502.56 - 505.36] and walk through it if you're getting
[503.76 - 507.04] bored please leave the video
[505.36 - 508.64] if you think this video is valid for
[507.04 - 509.68] your spouse or your brother or your
[508.64 - 511.52] sister who has
[509.68 - 513.04] constant gut problems please share this
[511.52 - 515.04] with them i'm telling you upfront it's
[513.04 - 517.12] 20 000 rupees to do this test but
[515.04 - 518.72] you know what you spend 45 and 60 000
[517.12 - 520.96] rupees on a computer
[518.72 - 522.40] and that gives you information it makes
[520.96 - 524.32] your life easier
[522.40 - 526.32] the microbiome is going to do exactly
[524.32 - 527.28] that figure out what foods to eat and
[526.32 - 528.96] not to eat
[527.28 - 531.12] so if i can just go through this very
[528.96 - 533.68] very quickly there's an index here
[531.12 - 535.76] so when this person's poop was an alice
[533.68 - 539.12] analyzed it takes three weeks to do it
[535.76 - 540.16] they have got a gut dysbiosis so the gut
[539.12 - 542.88] dysbiosis
[540.16 - 543.44] is meaning that the gut is not healthy
[542.88 - 544.88] now
[543.44 - 547.12] this score is being given by the
[544.88 - 548.08] microbiome lab so what they did is they
[547.12 - 550.40] went in and they found
[548.08 - 551.20] out the ratio like formic it is 65
[550.40 - 555.52] percent
[551.20 - 558.24] bacteria was 29 actinobacter it was 0.52
[555.52 - 560.56] so all of this needs to be higher so
[558.24 - 562.80] that it doesn't become bad for the gut
[560.56 - 564.24] okay like total pathogen in this person
[562.80 - 566.08] is eight point five three when it should
[564.24 - 567.20] be lesser than two percent so or as it
[566.08 - 570.08] is i already know that
[567.20 - 571.76] okay this person's gut is imbalance now
[570.08 - 573.60] picture this
[571.76 - 575.68] doctor i got pain in my stomach doctor i
[573.60 - 578.32] got constipation doctor i've not had
[575.68 - 580.72] proposed tools and everything okay
[578.32 - 583.36] prescription
[580.72 - 585.12] where is the analysis of the gut where
[583.36 - 588.08] is the analysis of the poop
[585.12 - 590.56] where is the analysis of your diet we
[588.08 - 592.64] are living in the 21st century
[590.56 - 593.92] which means if you have an issue we are
[592.64 - 595.84] doing testing right
[593.92 - 597.12] if you get coronavirus oh i got
[595.84 - 600.24] coronavirus feeder no
[597.12 - 601.76] you do the rt pcr test when your stomach
[600.24 - 602.72] is hurting and you're constipated what
[601.76 - 604.72] do you do
[602.72 - 606.56] do you do a breath test do you do a
[604.72 - 607.60] saliva test do you do a genetic test do
[606.56 - 609.60] you do a blood test
[607.60 - 611.76] do you do a poop analysis test my
[609.60 - 613.28] suggestion is do the poop microbiome
[611.76 - 614.96] genetic analysis test
[613.28 - 616.88] it will tell you the population of all
[614.96 - 618.48] the bacteria now hang on hang on let's
[616.88 - 620.56] figure out what we have okay
[618.48 - 623.04] we have the list of top bacterial
[620.56 - 623.76] pathogens imagine if you could give this
[623.04 - 625.44] list
[623.76 - 627.12] to your gastroenterologist you know
[625.44 - 629.92] what's the first thing they will say
[627.12 - 631.92] this is not required why because they
[629.92 - 633.20] want to do trial by fire error and give
[631.92 - 635.44] you all the possible
[633.20 - 637.28] broad spectrum antibiotics to get your
[635.44 - 639.84] condition under control
[637.28 - 642.40] but when medicine has advanced i repeat
[639.84 - 644.40] when medical genetics has advanced
[642.40 - 645.44] and our current crop of doctors do not
[644.40 - 648.40] have the genetic
[645.44 - 650.48] training then it's nice for you to take
[648.40 - 652.56] matters into your own hand and ask for
[650.48 - 654.56] microbiome test like a blood test
[652.56 - 656.64] because if you come to know that you
[654.56 - 658.64] have bacteria rights vulgatis
[656.64 - 660.40] we suddenly know there are certain foods
[658.64 - 662.16] that you should not give this person
[660.40 - 663.68] which cause the propagation of these bad
[662.16 - 666.24] bacteria or
[663.68 - 667.92] if you work with the clinical lab that
[666.24 - 670.00] doctor knows exactly which
[667.92 - 671.28] antibiotic they might need to give you
[670.00 - 673.12] for five to ten days
[671.28 - 674.24] to bring this population down but let me
[673.12 - 675.44] tell you something when we work at the
[674.24 - 678.48] coordination clinics
[675.44 - 681.36] we don't do it this way what we do
[678.48 - 683.12] is we work at the gut and look at food
[681.36 - 684.80] so look at the common fungal pathogens i
[683.12 - 686.96] was so happy this person
[684.80 - 688.96] had a fungal infection in the toes and
[686.96 - 690.08] all so we did not have anything in the
[688.96 - 692.24] gut as yet so this
[690.08 - 693.12] it was still on the skin level so pretty
[692.24 - 695.36] pretty good
[693.12 - 698.16] we need to get all of these
[695.36 - 700.48] staphylococcus aureus which is very high
[698.16 - 701.84] so a staph infection how do we bring it
[700.48 - 703.92] down we bring it down
[701.84 - 705.76] with the right herbs we bring it down
[703.92 - 706.96] with the right probiotics we bring it
[705.76 - 709.36] down with the right
[706.96 - 710.32] food so basically what this microbiome
[709.36 - 711.44] report does is
[710.32 - 713.52] it will also tell me all the good
[711.44 - 714.84] bacteria huh so look at the beneficial
[713.52 - 717.84] bacteria
[714.84 - 721.12] 7.425 fecal bacterium
[717.84 - 723.28] prosnutsy okay very very russian name
[721.12 - 725.04] but let's look at it 7.42 this should be
[723.28 - 727.20] around 1560.
[725.04 - 728.40] so once i start getting all of this
[727.20 - 730.40] check out this guy
[728.40 - 731.92] he's got everything low low low low no
[730.40 - 733.04] wonder he's complaining to me about
[731.92 - 735.68] constipation
[733.04 - 737.84] erratic bowel movement uh you know
[735.68 - 740.72] feeling miserable after having a party
[737.84 - 742.32] so we need to change all of these things
[740.72 - 744.24] all of these things we need to change
[742.32 - 746.56] change change and
[744.24 - 748.16] it's a new science it's a new science
[746.56 - 750.56] where the nutritionist says oh
[748.16 - 751.36] you've got all of these good bacteria
[750.56 - 753.20] that don't exist
[751.36 - 755.04] so what should i do what should i do
[753.20 - 757.76] what should i do look at this so many
[755.04 - 759.44] lactobacillus rotary beneficial
[757.76 - 761.92] lactobacillus rutiri
[759.44 - 764.16] and lactobacillus or aminosis both are
[761.92 - 766.56] zero i'll tell you a story
[764.16 - 767.44] they did this research on rats okay
[766.56 - 769.20] sterile that's
[767.44 - 772.80] okay so one group they gave this
[769.20 - 772.80] lactobacillus raminosis
[773.52 - 776.40] and the other group of rats they said no
[775.44 - 776.72] we're not going to feed you anything
[776.40 - 778.64] then
[776.72 - 781.52] boom they throw these rats into the
[778.64 - 784.16] water and told them swim better swim
[781.52 - 786.40] now the guys that got raminosis i think
[784.16 - 788.96] it was ramunosus and plantaris
[786.40 - 790.08] lactobacillus plantarius they swam for
[788.96 - 793.04] 17 percent
[790.08 - 794.80] longer what the scientists concluded
[793.04 - 798.16] that
[794.80 - 798.88] the will to live motivation feel-good
[798.16 - 802.48] factor
[798.88 - 804.88] grit comes from your gut and this
[802.48 - 806.08] gentleman or this lady whose test has
[804.88 - 810.80] come to me
[806.08 - 813.52] has got zero zero so the will to live
[810.80 - 814.16] i believe from the rat study is lower
[813.52 - 815.60] hang on
[814.16 - 817.28] you don't want me to compare it a human
[815.60 - 817.76] body to rat in a rat study clinical
[817.28 - 820.32] study
[817.76 - 822.48] absolutely fine but think about it
[820.32 - 824.08] you're supposed to have in a good person
[822.48 - 826.24] this would be anywhere from two to five
[824.08 - 829.44] percent so there's a lacking
[826.24 - 833.28] that means years of antibiotic abuse
[829.44 - 835.60] bpa abuse uh and diabetes abuse
[833.28 - 837.04] uh heart pressure medication boom boom
[835.60 - 838.32] boom boom boom boom boom boom all of
[837.04 - 839.60] that you keep into your body
[838.32 - 841.28] all of these bacteria are going to be
[839.60 - 842.16] saying that i am getting killed by all
[841.28 - 845.28] of these
[842.16 - 847.12] uh bombs dropping on me the the foreign
[845.28 - 850.00] bombs dropping into my body
[847.12 - 852.00] so uh basically what we do is we get
[850.00 - 853.84] into it and the lab comes back to me and
[852.00 - 855.60] says hey you know what in vegetables
[853.84 - 857.84] you can give all of these foods you can
[855.60 - 860.24] avoid these foods so basically
[857.84 - 862.40] what we are doing is we are looking at
[860.24 - 865.60] all the things in the diet
[862.40 - 867.60] and for example under the vegetables we
[865.60 - 871.36] have a gut restoration
[867.60 - 873.76] okay so so for me the gut restoration
[871.36 - 876.00] means a 21 day cycle
[873.76 - 878.44] in that 21 days i can give the foods
[876.00 - 879.92] which say gut maintenance to change the
[878.44 - 882.00] microflora
[879.92 - 884.24] and four months later i do the
[882.00 - 885.76] microbiome test again if you wish
[884.24 - 887.36] but i'm telling you people who have done
[885.76 - 890.48] the microbiome testing
[887.36 - 892.96] begin to see results after four weeks
[890.48 - 894.64] because we have just eliminated things
[892.96 - 896.32] for example i'm not supposed to give
[894.64 - 898.16] this person broccoli and cauliflower in
[896.32 - 900.00] the first 21 days
[898.16 - 901.28] okay and then we go through various
[900.00 - 904.32] foods like
[901.28 - 905.44] i mean come on yeah i mean in in in my
[904.32 - 908.08] right mind for
[905.44 - 911.36] for this client how would i know to
[908.08 - 913.60] avoid carrot potato and tapioca
[911.36 - 915.04] so what is telling me to re-change the
[913.60 - 916.64] gut microflora
[915.04 - 918.40] don't give these foods because it will
[916.64 - 919.92] cause the growth of certain bacteria
[918.40 - 921.68] which are pathogenic
[919.92 - 924.00] and inhibit the growth of the good
[921.68 - 927.84] bacteria like for example
[924.00 - 930.16] i love giving kale or kale is so good
[927.84 - 931.68] it's anti-aging it's got great amount
[930.16 - 933.12] like it's better than spinach blah blue
[931.68 - 936.24] blue blue everything
[933.12 - 938.16] sweet potato yum so it's come across to
[936.24 - 940.80] me that hey don't give this person and i
[938.16 - 942.24] actually for a person have avoided these
[940.80 - 944.24] foods and they are now saying that the
[942.24 - 945.76] gut is actually improving
[944.24 - 947.52] and there are so many things in your
[945.76 - 948.72] dolls like okay so in this person all
[947.52 - 949.60] the dolls they're saying which are the
[948.72 - 950.96] superfoods
[949.60 - 952.64] so you know i can give amaranth
[950.96 - 954.64] buckwheat navy beans
[952.64 - 956.32] don't give quinoa in the first gut
[954.64 - 959.52] restoration phase
[956.32 - 961.28] so uh hey avoid green peas so just one
[959.52 - 962.80] thing there's a filter okay there's a
[961.28 - 965.12] there's a filter which is called the
[962.80 - 967.36] food intolerance and the food allergy
[965.12 - 970.32] report food sensitivity report
[967.36 - 972.08] that's my first filter and then my
[970.32 - 973.68] second filter is a microbiome filter and
[972.08 - 974.40] then my third filter is the genetic
[973.68 - 976.16] filter
[974.40 - 978.00] so greenpeace if they say don't give it
[976.16 - 979.04] in the blood filter i'm like okay blood
[978.00 - 980.32] test no green peas
[979.04 - 982.88] in the microbiome don't grave game
[980.32 - 984.88] please take it out so that way i build a
[982.88 - 985.44] population of foods to give or not to
[984.88 - 987.04] give
[985.44 - 989.84] and i think this is what is called a
[987.04 - 991.92] squa discover the capacity for a person
[989.84 - 993.60] that's my name like clinique nutrition
[991.92 - 995.28] for example in fruits almost everything
[993.60 - 997.12] is there in the list but don't give
[995.28 - 1000.08] grapes in the gut restoration
[997.12 - 1000.96] avoid banana the person loves banana
[1000.08 - 1003.12] what do i do
[1000.96 - 1004.80] oh well you don't eat banana because
[1003.12 - 1007.92] your microbiome does
[1004.80 - 1010.16] not like it no but banana is very good
[1007.92 - 1012.56] for health the
[1010.16 - 1014.40] entire premise of the universe today is
[1012.56 - 1016.00] generality when information is being
[1014.40 - 1018.40] disseminated
[1016.00 - 1019.76] when it comes to your health learn the
[1018.40 - 1022.84] concept of kua
[1019.76 - 1024.08] is it customized to my koa kua means my
[1022.84 - 1026.16] capacity
[1024.08 - 1028.40] so i do believe that the future 10 years
[1026.16 - 1030.88] from now will be custom nutrition
[1028.40 - 1032.56] custom supplementation custom medication
[1030.88 - 1034.48] did you know statins
[1032.56 - 1036.16] you can check for a gene in your body
[1034.48 - 1037.44] and figure out whether statins work or
[1036.16 - 1040.56] not work in your body
[1037.44 - 1042.16] apparently 25 of people also
[1040.56 - 1043.76] i don't remember the statistics clearly
[1042.16 - 1045.68] but nearly one fourth of the population
[1043.76 - 1047.92] do not respond to statins
[1045.68 - 1049.12] yet we will still do generalized
[1047.92 - 1051.04] medicine practice
[1049.12 - 1053.20] so i do believe the future is going to
[1051.04 - 1055.04] be customization
[1053.20 - 1056.24] a quan nutrition does that customization
[1055.04 - 1057.28] and that's the reason i make these
[1056.24 - 1058.72] videos hoping that
[1057.28 - 1060.72] you're that person that believes in
[1058.72 - 1062.32] customization most of the people would
[1060.72 - 1064.24] have dropped off at two minutes
[1062.32 - 1067.76] i don't care if you've watched the video
[1064.24 - 1070.64] till this far number one
[1067.76 - 1073.20] the money that you spend to customize
[1070.64 - 1076.32] your diet your nutrition and your health
[1073.20 - 1079.60] will be the cost of the latest iphone
[1076.32 - 1081.36] 128 gb uh the max version
[1079.60 - 1083.36] that's what you would spend but you
[1081.36 - 1085.28] would have
[1083.36 - 1086.56] six times the return on the investment
[1085.28 - 1088.16] unlike when i take my
[1086.56 - 1090.80] apple laptop and drop it down on the
[1088.16 - 1092.40] flow and it breaks
[1090.80 - 1094.08] you will get six times the return on
[1092.40 - 1097.68] your health by just living
[1094.08 - 1100.24] longer eating smarter eating healthier
[1097.68 - 1102.16] pooping better so there's a lot of stuff
[1100.24 - 1103.68] that is there in this report okay
[1102.16 - 1105.52] like in this person i'm not supposed to
[1103.68 - 1107.36] give palm oil one is putty
[1105.52 - 1109.28] all your food that you order from zomato
[1107.36 - 1111.60] and swiggy which is outside the
[1109.28 - 1113.28] restaurants they're not using expensive
[1111.60 - 1115.28] oil they're not cooking with coconut oil
[1113.28 - 1117.12] they're not cooking with olive oil
[1115.28 - 1118.40] it's too expensive palm oil is the
[1117.12 - 1120.00] cheapest oil
[1118.40 - 1122.08] okay so i'm not supposed to give this
[1120.00 - 1123.52] person safflower oil my genetic test
[1122.08 - 1125.92] said to give this person
[1123.52 - 1126.72] pufa which is safflower so i happily
[1125.92 - 1129.04] prescribed
[1126.72 - 1129.92] a safflower so now suddenly if i've done
[1129.04 - 1132.48] the microbiome
[1129.92 - 1134.16] i'm going in and saying uh your genetic
[1132.48 - 1136.00] report said you could have coconut oil
[1134.16 - 1137.84] so i'm going to go with coconut oil
[1136.00 - 1139.28] and i'm not going to give you olive oil
[1137.84 - 1140.64] because your olive oil in your genetic
[1139.28 - 1144.08] report said that
[1140.64 - 1145.68] mufa is bad for you so i i would kind of
[1144.08 - 1147.36] look at the balance in terms of do i
[1145.68 - 1148.96] want to first get the gutten alignment
[1147.36 - 1149.60] so maybe i'll give the olive oil or no
[1148.96 - 1151.04] no ryan
[1149.60 - 1152.80] don't give the olive oil right now we
[1151.04 - 1153.52] could survive on coconut oil we could
[1152.80 - 1156.00] give
[1153.52 - 1157.68] we could give a sesame oil till oil and
[1156.00 - 1159.36] we can give so many other oils that are
[1157.68 - 1160.16] there right so we could give sunflower
[1159.36 - 1162.08] ground
[1160.16 - 1163.76] so i think this is really really good in
[1162.08 - 1165.52] terms of what i need to do and in terms
[1163.76 - 1167.28] of spices whoa
[1165.52 - 1169.52] you know don't give this guy uh black
[1167.28 - 1171.28] cumin seeds oh in a covert time i've
[1169.52 - 1173.36] told everyone
[1171.28 - 1174.64] take black cumin seeds very very very
[1173.36 - 1176.72] good because it's got
[1174.64 - 1178.72] antiviral properties but for this person
[1176.72 - 1180.72] no black cumin seeds in his kada
[1178.72 - 1182.32] so you got to figure out how we do all
[1180.72 - 1184.40] of these things so
[1182.32 - 1186.00] i believe that there's a lot that you
[1184.40 - 1190.32] can learn from here
[1186.00 - 1192.40] and this is the microbiome kit it comes
[1190.32 - 1194.80] to you at your home
[1192.40 - 1196.88] it's a small bottle inside you put a
[1194.80 - 1197.60] plastic film across your commode your
[1196.88 - 1199.84] pot
[1197.60 - 1201.92] you poop on top of that plastic film you
[1199.84 - 1203.36] get up take a scoop there's a scoop in
[1201.92 - 1205.12] the bottle that comes in
[1203.36 - 1207.04] you put it into the bottle which has a
[1205.12 - 1207.84] preservative liquid close it just a
[1207.04 - 1211.28] little tiny
[1207.84 - 1213.92] like less than like 1 8 of a teaspoon
[1211.28 - 1214.72] of poop i know this sounds gross shake
[1213.92 - 1216.32] it up
[1214.72 - 1218.24] tighten it put it in the envelope seal
[1216.32 - 1220.00] it up put up if you're in india
[1218.24 - 1222.24] we will send the you'll send the the
[1220.00 - 1223.76] microbiome thing across to my address
[1222.24 - 1225.44] we send it to the lab the lab takes
[1223.76 - 1226.56] three to four weeks to process this
[1225.44 - 1229.36] entire report
[1226.56 - 1230.72] report comes to me and say hi mr xyz
[1229.36 - 1232.08] let's walk through your microbiome
[1230.72 - 1234.48] report and then you start
[1232.08 - 1235.68] getting a diet so we my clinic builds
[1234.48 - 1237.12] you a separate diet
[1235.68 - 1239.20] this is the cost only of the testing of
[1237.12 - 1241.28] the report the diet is separate
[1239.20 - 1242.40] so we do a diet plan for you now what do
[1241.28 - 1244.24] you need to do
[1242.40 - 1246.00] you know me ryan fernando message me on
[1244.24 - 1249.84] any of one of my social media handles
