Transcript: Abidjan okay okay hi good afternoon everyone thank you for your patience Bangla is bad traffic I apologize once again I thought I would be done by 2:30 3:00 but unfortunately no my name is Ryan Fernando if you yeah my name is Ryan Fernando I'm a sports nutritionist I've worked with some of the best athletes in the country I today run a clinic in India called Cohen nutrition have about 45 nutritionists who work with me our job is to change the way people eat it goes with Grandpa who's also doing a marathon and young kids also the whole idea is the human body is a unique machine and we are all eating out of love and culture so love comes from mummy or love comes from the wife or the mother okay and it then changes to the culture so if you are a Marwari you will have a certain type of food if you're a kinetic car you'll have a certain type of food if you are from Madhya Pradesh will have a certain type of food I'm from Goa so I'll eat a certain type of food and then if you marry your nan go on your food gets changed completely so there's a lot of changes that happen you know you're from North India you move to South India anybody's come from North India relocated over here then the food yeah so your food change is correct certainly dosa becomes and Italy becomes a new part of the diet and all so my job today is to convince you two things what you are doing is wrong the first thing I want to convince you is what you're doing is wrong for embackment in perspective for the parents over here you please do whatever you do whenever you get hypertension cholesterol BP you come to us after that but for the children we can't afford for them to fall for them to become lesser in terms of performance so I'm going to give you some secret tips today hope at some point you'll understand like coaching you have to invest in a coach and get quotes because everyone can play Backman on the owner I played shuttle in school no I also played in college so you also played I also played we can teach our children but why do we come to an academy why do we come with professional coaches the idea is they know how to train the individual correctly why do we send our children to school because the teacher and the school and the principal know how to import education the function of a nutritionist is to impart the education towards sipar puta dal chawal roti protein powder sports drink how to take when to take how much to take this is very important this starts as young as the age of 6 anyone over your 6 years of age 7 8 9 10 11 years old 11 years old okay so 11 11 is my first starting point over here so I have athletes as young as 8 years of age okay any other parents here children are less than 10 years of age yeah before 10 years of age is the exact age to capture the children for eating 12 13 they are forming adult mindset I don't like this I don't like that all of those things so we will we will talk today's how we go through everything okay which sport do you see everybody which sport you just look at it over here and tell me which sport do you see which one came to your mind first a badminton player will see the background in first a tennis player will see the tennis first okay what's my point this is saying okay and this thing is for the kids can you read this thing for me how hard do you play when no one watches what does that mean appreciatively I'm correct correct you have to play your best the problem today is everything is about a selfie repeat check' a Technica selfie book it's not about the selfie it's about who you are so for those of you who have back meant in players there are only two questions I asked one do you love back mitten or do you like badminton like oh love love love so if you love does nothing from tomorrow morning onwards don't get up with an alarm clock get up on your own okay that's the true sign of a champion oh I've seen this at though I have about 6,000 athletes over the last 20 years with me okay I've had some of the best in India come to me the last word the the guy that I'm currently working on is cyber on it okay so we are working on a vajayjay Rama Marwan but all of these guys sign on a wall all of them have come to tours for nutrition planning but what I want to say to you is as a parent if your child shows love to the game you move heaven and earth for that child if the child shows like you have alternate plans in place also okay the first question was do you love Batman the second question I have then is do you want to play for the country how many of you want to play for the country please raise your hand okay I'll give you a small tip to all the athletes in over here the number one ability for you to win is not in food is not in coaching is not in your equipment it is in your head do you know what that word is it starts with C confidence the number one trait for any player in any sport in any sport is confidence you have the confidence you will win the problem with Indian athletes is they take 10 years to acquire confidence in their 20s 25 then they get the confidence what if you had confidence today that you are the world number 1 how would you play then like world number 2 no you'll be like I am the West in the world so if you saw my first slide with me in the photo did anyone notice what I what I wrote at the bottom no I'll play it back to you again [Music] what did I write read it for me I may not be the best but when I put the word I am the best over there what does it do to me it gives me confidence plus it gives me fear because I have to prove that I'm the best now so which means every morning when I'm getting up I am studying I am preparing for my seminar I am looking at diet charts I am looking at scientific studies what should you do as a beginner player I'm the number one battement player in my academy in my district in my state in my country once you start having this thought process you will start winning it's got nothing to do with bananas or walnuts actually bananas and walnuts actually help in the brain performance I'll come to that but confidence is the number and so from today onwards I'll say hi my name is Ryan what's your name shake hands nice and form sure and my name is Sharon you gotta have confidence do all the badminton players you can't be shy because if you're shy your pony is going to defeat you you have to call out that you are the best you don't do that you're not give a stick get the point never mind if you are not the best never mind if you come last in the tournament it's okay but every day you keep telling yourself that you move up the ladder okay so today I want to talk about the basics in terms of what we need to be doing and all so how hard do you play when no one's watching what I want to point out to parents is this okay if you see over here 33% is rest and recovery 33% is nutrition 33% is training what most sports individuals in India do is invest only in training about one good shoes papaya one best your next record bethe Ryan said you have to sleep minimum eight hours at nighttime how much should be sleep yesterday do so how do you know seven has thirty minutes you got

moment I looked at everyone I was looking all were wearing trackers I went to him so he slipped motors on he's
