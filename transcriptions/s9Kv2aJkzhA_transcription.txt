[0.00 - 4.52] so my first question to you what is acid
[2.08 - 7.24] reflux okay acid reflux is basically
[4.52 - 9.28] reflex of the stomach acid back into the
[7.24 - 11.96] esophagus reflux means what it comes
[9.28 - 13.88] back H regurgitation basically the acid
[11.96 - 16.00] should be in the stomach alone but
[13.88 - 17.80] unfortunately something has happened
[16.00 - 19.40] where the spinter muscle there is a
[17.80 - 21.64] muscle at the end of the junction of the
[19.40 - 23.56] foot pipe and the stomach it is supposed
[21.64 - 24.88] to close it's like a gate it's a gate
[23.56 - 27.16] it's a door if that doesn't close
[24.88 - 29.00] properly the acid comes so when you eat
[27.16 - 30.72] food goes inside the stomach the acid
[29.00 - 32.60] secreted by the stomach and it gets
[30.72 - 34.08] broken down into small pieces correct
[32.60 - 35.84] and then the lots of acid is being
[34.08 - 39.00] secreted because we eat a lot so what
[35.84 - 41.56] happens is if the door is open because
[39.00 - 44.60] acid is secreted acid comes back into
[41.56 - 44.60] the esophagus
