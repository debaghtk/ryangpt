Transcript: [Music] do you want to lose fat without going to the gym well I work with a lot of celebrities actors film stars and common people that walk into my nutrition clinic where I as a nutritionist advise them on the nutrition part but they always ask me how do I burn more fat without doing any exercise now here are a few tips number one research has shown that neat not on exercise adaptive thermogenesis meaning what when you do cooking cleaning mopping sweeping or just moving around your house and doing laundry and gardening the low intensity of that work your heart rate beats at a level where it utilizes more fat as a source of energy imagine your body having two batteries a carbohydrate battery and a fat battery now when you do high-intensity gym exercises you're burning more of the car carbohydrate battery and fat is like boss this is too intense for me I can't work out with this giving this fuel source however when you change the intensity of the workout drop your intensity your car battery goes down but your fat battery begins to increase now this is where you get more substrate utilization from fat as a source of energy meaning your fat battery kicks in chances of you burning more fat is there I would recommend you to do walking because it's a low intensity activity and a sustained duration of Beyond 10,000 steps a day will help you burn more than 30 G of fat a day 30 G because people are like I want to lose 1 kg in 1 week you need to increase the increment of walking to go beyond 30 G of fat burning a day below 10,000 steps you do not cross the 30 G of fat burning per day so keep this in mind now how do you do walk walking you could do walking in one shot 10,000 steps is roughly around 10 km of walking which will take you about 1 hour 40 minutes if you're short and if you're tall it should take you about 1 hour 20 minutes let's say now who has time to walk for so much so break it up do 15 minutes of walking after your first meal do 15 minutes of walking after your lunch do 15 minutes of walking after your dinner you've got 45 minutes of walking there now walk and talk whenever you're doing phone calls with your loved ones business calls I do meetings with my key strategic team and they're like okay sir's on the Rampage right now he wants to do a walking meeting and we do a 20 30 minute walking meeting and before you know it you've got a lot of steps the other thing you could also do is get a standing desk so behind me over here I have a standing desk as well as a sitting desk so sometimes some of my online meetings I will stand up I'll have my headphones on and I'm like you know moving a little bit and stuff like that so I'm creating movement which doesn't raise my heart rate so high and therefore I'm utilizing my fat as a source of energy my second tip to you is I also advise cold showers on a daily basis because research is showing that the cold receptors activate Brown fat in your body which will burn more fat so every day I have a cold shower in the morning the cold receptors are on your face if you don't have patience or The Bravery to do cold showers every morning get a nice big salad bowl or a or a fruit bowl and fill it with ice and dip your head in it and hold it in there and go I blow bubbles okay uh for about 4 to 10 seconds maybe if you can go more than 10 seconds you might get a brain freeze so be careful come out do a little bit of calm deep breathing Because deep breaths activate the parasympathetic nervous system so combination of the cold and the structured breathing and when you put your face in once you go in 3 to five times with small breaks in between of 30 seconds to 1 minute this could be a form of um what I call is a salad bowl plune but you could also do a cold plune once every 10 days or maybe twice a month wherein you immerse yourself into a nice bathtub filled with ice and it need not be too cold maybe just a 2 kg bag of ice with cold water in that btub should get you to the levels you start shivering and stuff like that so that should help you um set yourself on a pathway also if you have inflammation because you're working out walking so much uh it helps your body heal faster making you feel like a million bucks and rejuvenated the third point in addition to all of this is take up a sport or play with your kids that's very important like I did Karate when I was very young I've taken up Karate back again I've moved it to do three times a week of karate if you did yoga yoga is amazing the resting heart rate is is low so it burns fat even weight training with incremented rest in between heavier weights but lesser repetitions would allow your heart rate to be in that zone where you've taken it up as a sport so when you look at getting to burn fat you want to be physically moving and it could be in a sport that you love final Point work with your physiotherapist or biomechanics expert as you grow older you will lose muscle muscle is the singular fat burning machine it is the secret fat burning machine when your muscle gets older it gets weaker so develop the necessary Awareness on which muscles in your body need to be loaded and which muscles need to be flexible this will enable you to have better balances when you're doing the sport or walking on a daily basis above all I always tell people control your taste buds because that is the chief temperat in your body that's causing you to gain fat do a blood test once or twice every year and look for the markers that are causing you to put on weight chiefly fat those could be vitamin D vitamin B12 the vitamin B complexes look at lipoprotein A lipoprotein B and all the lipid or cholesterol markers these are clear indications that your diet as well as your liver is producing more amount of fatty acids and that also could have a detrimental effect on your health above all eat clean stay organic as much as possible breathe deeply that's very very important and enjoy life you have only one body it's the most expensive real estate you'll ever own
