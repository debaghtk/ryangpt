[4.10 - 11.64] I'm so dense you you can have caffeine I
[8.82 - 13.05] can't have Gaffney back outside I only
[11.64 - 16.08] have the things in the world
[13.05 - 19.44] snake soccer and the skilled since I
[16.08 - 24.69] found them from when Jesus I'm gluten
[19.44 - 26.82] intolerant I don't know what to do it's
[24.69 - 29.52] so sad like most of the things that I
[26.82 - 32.64] like eating everything has lieutenant
[29.52 - 34.56] but I don't have it so that it's much
[32.64 - 39.21] better off that you can eat you can but
[34.56 - 41.61] I thought yeah but I won't like my
[39.21 - 44.76] coffee like a good cup of coffee
[41.61 - 47.04] every evening before work our time the
[44.76 - 49.98] fact that I can't have it all I got
[47.04 - 54.02] shouldn't rather have it is quite shiny
[49.98 - 56.52] but I know that it's thick for my good
[54.02 - 59.88] coffee for biscuits and
[56.52 - 65.10] pizzas burgers cakes yeah that's true I
[59.88 - 69.60] am slightly luckier than you but like
[65.10 - 71.52] you know my body not being able to you
[69.60 - 77.88] know absorb caffeine is also like
[71.52 - 81.15] slightly sad yeah my ring stuff
[77.88 - 83.76] yeah I think so Nick ever since I bought
[81.15 - 87.12] the G test and then ryan told me that
[83.76 - 89.85] you know caffeine can also be a trigger
[87.12 - 91.50] for migraine and absolutely you know had
[89.85 - 94.41] I known this earlier I think I would
[91.50 - 97.95] have still handle lesser episodes of
[94.41 - 99.51] severe migraine as the tea attacks than
[97.95 - 103.26] I would have probably missed less
[99.51 - 106.61] because of it yeah having a good
[103.26 - 111.06] nutritionist and having a plan your
[106.61 - 114.57] nutrition is so important they you need
[111.06 - 116.55] to not let at least need to know what
[114.57 - 117.96] you know how to feel the body and what
[116.55 - 120.12] suits them what's going to make them
[117.96 - 121.68] better athlete and for something like
[120.12 - 124.32] that you know I'm very glad that we have
[121.68 - 130.14] dynamic that anything else with the
[124.32 - 131.10] nutrition so I think I'm coping without
[130.14 - 135.41] the Newton
[131.10 - 138.78] because much sparser and more it I think
[135.41 - 140.94] everything o that they recommend us to
[138.78 - 143.64] eat you know that and like whatever
[140.94 - 146.73] quantity so that's definitely that will
[143.64 - 150.50] help our body to stay in top shape and
[146.73 - 152.88] recover from one car to another and also
[150.50 - 156.21] diversity is really important you know
[152.88 - 158.49] vitamins and supplements that we do need
[156.21 - 161.43] and you know especially since you're
[158.49 - 163.08] getting older I think you need to take
[161.43 - 164.52] care of your nutrition slightly for
[163.08 - 167.82] because you know your body doesn't
[164.52 - 170.43] recover enough yeah and even though you
[167.82 - 172.32] are you know like the physical body
[170.43 - 177.65] everything mossad an awkward nutrition
[172.32 - 177.65] also plays a very big role in recovery
[180.30 - 184.70] definitely anion has been so helpful
[182.49 - 187.41] with you know recommending and
[184.70 - 190.20] suggesting what we should eat and what
[187.41 - 193.86] quantity to eat it it just gets so easy
[190.20 - 196.32] to you know prepare meals and no heat
[193.86 - 199.74] the connect to it yeah my answers no you
[196.32 - 203.58] can't expect a while to perform like a
[199.74 - 207.57] Ferrari and then give it food like an
[203.58 - 212.91] ambassador that's you will yourself like
[207.57 - 214.47] you're fueling up are you take person
[212.91 - 217.74] that's so true I mean you can't expect
[214.47 - 220.86] to eat cakes and pastries and then go
[217.74 - 224.31] and you know too hard a kilometer about
[220.86 - 226.74] success will be help I'm not I can't eat
[224.31 - 230.01] cakes at they still decide for you know
[226.74 - 232.14] just an example yeah yeah nobody that
[230.01 - 235.74] happy times already cakes and pastries
[232.14 - 237.96] about even though like I found out I was
[235.74 - 241.62] proven thing much later if only you I
[237.96 - 244.32] had the knowledge about this much of you
[241.62 - 246.54] if I dug this gene when I was much
[244.32 - 249.62] younger as a kid I think I was probably
[246.54 - 252.36] you know but actually I'm talking about
[249.62 - 254.85] cakes and pastries and you being looted
[252.36 - 255.61] intolerant then I mean so many times
[254.85 - 258.28] with
[255.61 - 261.25] like a chocolate or like pastry then on
[258.28 - 263.23] the phone without yes I never will take
[261.25 - 266.32] me you finished legging I need the water
[263.23 - 268.80] and because of the sugar we've had such
[266.32 - 272.62] a crash in the middle of the workout and
[268.80 - 275.08] you know just like Oh consulting with
[272.62 - 277.54] Ryan it's just helped us understand
[275.08 - 279.52] better what we should be prior to and
[277.54 - 281.26] after work on to avoid such you know
[279.52 - 282.91] circumstances where you are you're
[281.26 - 284.74] feeling heavy in over powder you have a
[282.91 - 289.93] sudden crash because you're in too much
[284.74 - 292.66] sugar true yeah I mean more than what to
[289.93 - 293.83] eat also how much to eat and when to eat
[292.66 - 296.23] makes a huge difference
[293.83 - 299.50] that's nodding up a burger was for both
[296.23 - 301.93] sides once I got since I will start
[299.50 - 303.91] working with my recovery is so much
[301.93 - 307.00] better and I think also my the quality
[303.91 - 309.40] of my focus has improved substantially
[307.00 - 313.51] so I'm hoping you know in the long run
[309.40 - 316.96] will definitely make me much faster and
[313.51 - 320.50] much more lytic yeah and also the fact
[316.96 - 322.78] that uh you know the food that he
[320.50 - 325.87] recommends all the times that he gives
[322.78 - 328.75] it pretty much covers your carbs
[325.87 - 330.37] proteins essential vitamins and minerals
[328.75 - 332.53] so you have to depend lesser on
[330.37 - 334.75] supplements as was is really really
[332.53 - 336.76] falling short which is I think very good
[334.75 - 339.04] if you're getting you know your main
[336.76 - 341.23] sources of caffeine and you know of fat
[339.04 - 343.45] and essential vitamins and then the
[341.23 - 346.48] strong fruits and vegetables and your
[343.45 - 348.04] need oh you know it's just generally I
[346.48 - 352.03] think it's much better than you know
[348.04 - 353.67] taking unnecessary supplements to fill
[352.03 - 356.50] yourself
[353.67 - 358.33] subdue does need to be taken with the
[356.50 - 360.64] right kind of guidance you just don't
[358.33 - 364.48] take things because somebody else takes
[360.64 - 366.19] them on taking ten scoop of protein per
[364.48 - 367.84] day or fifteen but is neither created
[366.19 - 371.92] per day is not going to make you
[367.84 - 374.47] exaction multivitamins like maybe water
[371.92 - 376.45] is recommended to you you know I may
[374.47 - 378.58] need slightly more because you know my
[376.45 - 381.94] body doesn't absorb the certain vitamins
[378.58 - 385.24] in spite of all you know that I just
[381.94 - 386.33] need like my body needs more of it so
[385.24 - 389.06] and last
[386.33 - 390.83] Kalama girls so I think having a proper
[389.06 - 392.12] nutritionist but it is very very
[390.83 - 394.10] important yeah
[392.12 - 396.71] you can't just blindly follow someone
[394.10 - 398.75] else's diet or what someone else is
[396.71 - 402.29] having in terms of you know supplements
[398.75 - 407.12] or multivitamins and all the other
[402.29 - 408.92] important things yeah commander everyone
[407.12 - 412.70] gets a nutritionist and you know they're
[408.92 - 415.13] gay and improve yourself and make
[412.70 - 417.89] yourself better athletes and stronger
[415.13 - 422.35] athletes at that and I think we've been
[417.89 - 425.06] working with Ryan for about a few months
[422.35 - 428.45] definitely found a lot of difference you
[425.06 - 431.84] know we can recover better we are eating
[428.45 - 434.27] mindfully of course we do cheap we don't
[431.84 - 436.01] call it a cheat but you know I think
[434.27 - 438.14] that's what science has helped us
[436.01 - 440.12] understand that it's not exactly a cheat
[438.14 - 442.13] but yeah that you know we're humans at
[440.12 - 444.92] the end of the day so you know even if
[442.13 - 447.08] he is gluten intolerant like the guy and
[444.92 - 449.90] says you know maybe once a month he can
[447.08 - 451.82] have a burger Rita you know just to you
[449.90 - 453.44] know like make yourself happy even
[451.82 - 455.60] that's important but you do need a
[453.44 - 457.76] proper nutritionist to guide you in the
[455.60 - 461.15] right direction of what to eat what not
[457.76 - 464.15] to eat and how much to eat and Ryan has
[461.15 - 467.65] been fabulous in helping us you know
[464.15 - 470.18] recover in terms of a sport and
[467.65 - 472.55] everything yeah I would definitely
[470.18 - 475.09] recommend out but I had no patience for
[472.55 - 475.09] us
