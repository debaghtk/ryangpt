Transcript: [Music] congratulations mommies well you're going to be holding a new bundle of joy now I have worked with celebrity film stars rock stars on their newborn babies when they are in the womb here are some of my secrets that I privately give these celebrity moms in my nutrition counseling room number one it's but obvious you have to eat when you have to eat organic you have to eat with a plan so get a nutrition plan carefully balanced you don't need to eat for two you need to eat only about 3 to 400 calories more per day when you're carrying a new born baby in you most important get a nutritional blood test done look at all your vitamins look at all your minerals look at hemoglobin fertin and iron this is crucial and important but nobody's talking about nobody's talking about omega3 you can do a pin prick blood test DM me message me get in touch with me at the qua nutrition clinics or wherever I am on the internet I will reply to you about how I can send you a kit where you can just take a pin prick blood samp and put it onto a filter paper and determine the omega3 and Omega 6 ratios in your blood now why is this important did you know that your child's brain requires dh8 which is a key omega3 molecule and most women will lose up to 2% of their brain Yes you heard me right you will lose up to 2% % of your brain because your brain contains DHA the mother's brain and you sacrifice that to give it to your child now you don't need to do this if you know the omega-3 and you take the right fatty fish or flax seed or chia seeds or walnuts you can boost your body's natural content of Omega-3 to take a nutritional supplement and get in touch with your doctor and he or she should be able to prescribe a good Omega DHA supplement for you third Point start exercising look at permission from from your doctor to do yoga and weight training I remember when my wife was carrying she weight trained and she had a nonc section delivery merely because the doctor said Madam because you walked you did yoga and you trained well you had a Flawless delivery and we have only one child when you want to get a good baby you want to reduce the exposure to EMF electromagnetic frequency I see people with laptops on their lap don't keep that next to you because it's pinging on blue Bluetooth and Wi-Fi don't use the Bluetooth headphones keep your mobile phone away from you put it on speaker phone better still get one of those old age cordless phones and connect it to your mobile phone and talk from far away look at se I see a lot of mothers because now they are wanting to Netflix have downtime they postpone their bedtime into later night did you know that research says the earlier you sleep to the sunset the deeper sleep you get in the first 3 hours releases growth hormone the growth hormone rejuvenates your body gets the baby's cellular development even better to sleep better walk on grass research is showing that when mothers walk on grass they discharge to the Earth the negative EMF radiations that we are surrounded in this bubble of technology so please do walk on grass dad's your responsibility if you're watching this video take your wife for a walk just walk and talk on the grass that's very very important second aqi a Quality Index we all live in cities with tremendous amount of pollution so what I would suggest is for the time in your house which is 10 to 12 hours invest in a great air filter it reduces the paths per million which actually has a phenomenal impact you know those molecules go into your body and there's Jaga happening now if the baby's nutrition is there and then there is the Jaga nutrition there is a nutrition to protect the body imagine if there was no fight inside of your body because of pollution then all the nutrition and energy could be saved for the energy of the development of the fetus unborn child final points that you need to do is get some sunlight look in the Sun and I tell a lot of mothers lift your um shirt or t-shirt or clothing above your belly and let your child's get some sunshine through the womb so the best time is 9 to 12 in the morning and uh see that you step out and see that your stomach and the womb gets exposed to some sunlight because that kid inside of you is going to be squinting which means better eye development and he as he develops in the womb and the final Point Music research is now saying that everything from schas to mozat and b or just you humming or you having a nice conversation the baby's auditory signal picks this up for the brain development and sensory perception so if you want a great kid if if you want a musician start listening to music better still dance a little bit your baby is going to be one hell of a Michael Jackson if you do this above all sleep well eat well think positive thoughts most people if they vibrate at a negative frequency negative thoughts the baby is receiving those negative thoughts you have to have to be positive and above all as I always say your body is the most expensive real estate you will ever own and now you just decided to do some expansion which is the new baby and that baby is going to be your next best most expensive real estate you'll ever handle in your life so good luck moms good luck dads and if you need any help please reach out to me and I'll be happy to advise you on your nutrition plan for your unbo child
