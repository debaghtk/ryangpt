[0.64 - 5.68] being an Indian it is a very hard
[2.80 - 8.52] commitment to live without sugar because
[5.68 - 10.64] we have surrounded ourselves with it I
[8.52 - 13.20] guarantee you just look around in your
[10.64 - 16.00] house in your fridge your kitchen you
[13.20 - 18.48] will find it and look at our association
[16.00 - 20.80] from the very beginning of our life we
[18.48 - 23.36] are brought up this way if the child
[20.80 - 26.24] cries then we give them some toffee
[23.36 - 29.52] candy or something sweet to make them
[26.24 - 32.68] feel good if he receives some good news
[29.52 - 35.60] then we and lus and other sweets to our
[32.68 - 37.80] relatives my child is passed with 95%
[35.60 - 40.52] and I have some sweets for you in all of
[37.80 - 43.72] our shadis and parties the dessert
[40.52 - 46.92] counter is a must with a minimum of four
[43.72 - 50.04] items on the menu ice cream gulab jamun
[46.92 - 53.04] jellies custard cakes and a lot more we
[50.04 - 57.16] celebrate sugar every time everywhere
[53.04 - 59.08] when I say sugar it is all refined sugar
[57.16 - 62.36] which you all know about it is
[59.08 - 68.24] detrimental but but still we let it go
[62.36 - 70.72] we choose taste over healthy living wait
[68.24 - 74.32] am I saying if you consume sugar daily
[70.72 - 76.64] you are not healthy yes I am there are
[74.32 - 80.56] two main types of sugar in the human
[76.64 - 83.56] diet naturally occurring sugar and added
[80.56 - 85.84] sugar you can consume sugars already
[83.56 - 89.92] found in natural foods like fruits and
[85.84 - 92.24] milk but not added sugar in processed or
[89.92 - 95.56] prepared foods and drinks this is what
[92.24 - 97.28] I'm going to be warning you about now if
[95.56 - 101.08] you're deciding to cut back on your
[97.28 - 102.44] added sugar intake it's no easy task
[101.08 - 105.40] however the benefits of cutting out
[102.44 - 108.04] sugar may include improved oral and
[105.40 - 110.84] heart health weight reduction and much
[108.04 - 113.76] much more if you want to control it you
[110.84 - 116.72] must save cookies candies and bakery
[113.76 - 119.92] items only for special occasions once a
[116.72 - 123.08] month small portion is okay now in your
[119.92 - 125.36] daily use limit the sugar in your coffee
[123.08 - 127.68] tea or any other beverages that you make
[125.36 - 129.80] in fact I personally don't add any sugar
[127.68 - 133.32] at all because that eliminates four to 5
[129.80 - 136.28] teaspoons a day of sugar now skip any
[133.32 - 138.88] product that lists sugar among its first
[136.28 - 141.24] five ingredients so look at the label
[138.88 - 144.24] these days packaged food companies have
[141.24 - 146.84] become smarter they adding agents of
[144.24 - 149.00] sugars in the ingredients and even
[146.84 - 151.32] though it's mentioned the arm army does
[149.00 - 153.56] not know their Nam and keeps consuming
[151.32 - 155.32] these products don't worry this is why
[153.56 - 157.56] you follow me what I'm going to do is in
[155.32 - 160.00] the description I've made a list of
[157.56 - 162.64] harmful ingredients that you should be
[160.00 - 166.32] avoiding when you go for shopping at the
[162.64 - 168.16] grocery stores now please save this list
[166.32 - 170.48] and compare them with the ingredients on
[168.16 - 173.48] the products and see what all products
[170.48 - 175.80] contain first sugars in Hidden forms or
[173.48 - 177.64] even the word added sugar you will be
[175.80 - 179.92] surprised and this is where your
[177.64 - 181.92] awareness can get you to the next level
[179.92 - 185.04] just be aware of what you're buying in
[181.92 - 188.04] packaged foods have you ever wondered
[185.04 - 190.76] what would happen if you completely gave
[188.04 - 193.32] up sugar for 2 weeks well let me tell
[190.76 - 196.08] you about it number one the first thing
[193.32 - 198.52] that you will notice is the changes in
[196.08 - 201.76] your face the puffiness goes down and
[198.52 - 203.68] your midsection will become less puffy
[201.76 - 207.04] less bloated your face will go from
[203.68 - 208.68] being Dr to a Lena face and you'll see
[207.04 - 211.20] the same transformation and I can
[208.68 - 212.88] promise you in your midsection this
[211.20 - 215.72] happens because your liver starts
[212.88 - 217.92] releasing fat when you cut out sugar
[215.72 - 220.56] your body is forced to burn fat for a
[217.92 - 222.80] fuel as sugar and fat are the only two
[220.56 - 225.96] fuel sources in your body that is being
[222.80 - 227.68] used so now you know why your jawline
[225.96 - 229.84] has gone for a toss with so much of
[227.68 - 232.56] sugar you might notice this change
[229.84 - 235.28] faster because our diet often includes a
[232.56 - 238.44] lot of sugars in Hidden forms like in
[235.28 - 240.72] drinks chutneys ketchups and curries
[238.44 - 243.52] avoiding sugar in your chai or skipping
[240.72 - 245.84] MTI can make a huge visible difference
[243.52 - 249.00] in your appearance the second thing that
[245.84 - 251.72] you will notice is that the organ
[249.00 - 253.44] function improves our four main organs
[251.72 - 257.24] that definitely benefit from cutting out
[253.44 - 259.56] sugar are the eyes the kidneys your
[257.24 - 261.88] pipelines or arteries and definitely
[259.56 - 265.00] your brain these changes will be visible
[261.88 - 267.20] to you in a few days to a few weeks in
[265.00 - 269.08] your eyes you will see that your vision
[267.20 - 271.92] will begin to improve and you will
[269.08 - 274.76] experience less blurriness your kidney
[271.92 - 277.44] function will improve as sugar induced
[274.76 - 279.72] inflammation drops trips to the L will
[277.44 - 281.88] actually decreases this is my personal
[279.72 - 284.08] experience now arteries are the
[281.88 - 286.36] pipelines in our body which carry vital
[284.08 - 288.88] nutrition via blood it carries oxy
[286.36 - 291.12] oxygen also the inflammation in your
[288.88 - 293.12] arteries definitely reduce science has
[291.12 - 295.48] proved this and it also improves your
[293.12 - 296.84] overall cardiovascular health now we all
[295.48 - 298.64] know that the brain is the most
[296.84 - 300.56] important organ in the human body for
[298.64 - 302.12] processing the the way we behave the way
[300.56 - 304.56] we think the way we sleep the way
[302.12 - 306.52] whatever we do is governed by our brain
[304.56 - 308.68] sugar is one of the primary fuels in the
[306.52 - 311.00] brain but too much of sugar can dull the
[308.68 - 312.96] brain you know when you drop sugar your
[311.00 - 315.88] cognitive function which is your ability
[312.96 - 318.68] to process DK will be enhanced and this
[315.88 - 320.44] results better memory focus and mood you
[318.68 - 322.48] can actually see this in children when
[320.44 - 324.24] you give them too much of sugar they
[322.48 - 326.36] actually cannot focus on a task and when
[324.24 - 328.44] you take away sugar they actually become
[326.36 - 331.52] quieter more focused and have better
[328.44 - 333.80] memories now given that our diet is rich
[331.52 - 336.40] in sugary drinks like sweet lassy fruit
[333.80 - 338.24] juices and sherbets now reducing sugar
[336.40 - 341.00] could lead to significant improvements
[338.24 - 343.00] in these areas but the choice is really
[341.00 - 345.92] tough because sugar on your taste buds
[343.00 - 348.12] is a real Temptation now if you remove
[345.92 - 350.64] sugar I can promise you you might notice
[348.12 - 352.76] fewer sugar crashes and better
[350.64 - 355.36] concentration during work or study the
[352.76 - 357.56] first 3 to 4 days will be difficult but
[355.36 - 359.84] as you eliminate sugar you will see the
[357.56 - 362.48] brain fog clearing by day five so so
[359.84 - 363.88] trust me on this eliminate sugar it's a
[362.48 - 365.96] little tough Journey for the first 3
[363.88 - 368.44] days but you get better then now another
[365.96 - 370.56] part is better sleep I've had so many
[368.44 - 372.72] clients in our Clinic telling me that
[370.56 - 374.48] when they've to cut out the sugar they
[372.72 - 377.00] find themselves getting up lesser at
[374.48 - 378.68] night to pee because sugar and then the
[377.00 - 380.68] kidneys and then the water function and
[378.68 - 383.44] then the sleep disturbance so sugar in
[380.68 - 384.88] your blood triggers more urination and
[383.44 - 386.76] this happens especially at night so
[384.88 - 388.64] cutting out sugar will actually help you
[386.76 - 391.24] sleep through the night better so good
[388.64 - 393.24] sleep is often disrupted by our late
[391.24 - 394.96] night sweets or sugary beverages you
[393.24 - 396.80] know in the IPL season recently all of
[394.96 - 399.20] us are getting up sleeping late and
[396.80 - 402.24] eating all of the sugars now avoiding
[399.20 - 404.60] this part can lead to more restful night
[402.24 - 406.96] sleep helping you feel more refreshed in
[404.60 - 408.88] the morning so I suggest no more dessert
[406.96 - 411.40] ordering at night it's the wrong time to
[408.88 - 413.16] eat something sugary the most important
[411.40 - 415.92] point and the fourth Point increased
[413.16 - 418.72] energy when you give up sugar contrary
[415.92 - 421.84] to everyone's belief lesser sugar your
[418.72 - 424.20] body will start burning up fat as the
[421.84 - 426.20] second battery in your body this switch
[424.20 - 428.68] will provide you with a steady energy
[426.20 - 430.44] Supply throughout the entire day
[428.68 - 432.16] eliminating the ups and downs that come
[430.44 - 433.84] with sugar consumption when you eat
[432.16 - 435.24] something sweet sugar goes up then it
[433.84 - 437.36] drops then you need more sugar it goes
[435.24 - 439.60] up then it drops down whereas fat is
[437.36 - 441.76] like a stable battery another thing that
[439.60 - 445.16] I've noticed is that the frequent intake
[441.76 - 446.96] of three to four times of chai or coffee
[445.16 - 448.56] can lead to energy crashes a lot of
[446.96 - 450.12] people feel very low energy so they
[448.56 - 451.48] switch to te your coffee
[450.12 - 453.36] but switching to the less sugary
[451.48 - 455.40] versions of herbal tea black tea or
[453.36 - 457.56] green tea can provide more sustained
[455.40 - 459.40] energy helping you get through your day
[457.56 - 461.96] more efficiently in fact here I have a
[459.40 - 463.56] quick tip if you watched this far
[461.96 - 466.64] research has shown that when you take
[463.56 - 468.52] green tea or black tea creative thinking
[466.64 - 471.32] actually gets boosted because of the
[468.52 - 474.32] thein content in green tea or black tea
[471.32 - 477.52] but the problem is when you add sugar to
[474.32 - 479.96] green tea or coffee the sugar Blends the
[477.52 - 483.00] calming effects of the Anon so if I were
[479.96 - 485.24] you I would make a lighter version of a
[483.00 - 487.84] herbal tea don't take your green tea and
[485.24 - 490.04] dip it and boil it for 2 to 3 minutes
[487.84 - 492.20] just do it five times with a tea bag or
[490.04 - 494.16] steep it for only 30 seconds and remove
[492.20 - 495.68] the tea leaves so it doesn't get bitter
[494.16 - 497.04] so then you're not saying oh I need more
[495.68 - 500.56] sugar I need more sugar I need more
[497.04 - 503.16] sugar go sugar lless in your herbal teas
[500.56 - 506.20] for better brain efficiency the fifth
[503.16 - 508.28] point is reduce cravings when you drop
[506.20 - 510.20] sugar you will notice that your craving
[508.28 - 512.76] between meals will decrease
[510.20 - 515.20] without sugar your body will use the
[512.76 - 517.92] stored fat for energy keeping you
[515.20 - 520.72] satisfied and less hungry in fact I got
[517.92 - 522.84] another secret for you you should always
[520.72 - 524.32] brush your teeth after every meal you
[522.84 - 526.28] should be working with thousands of
[524.32 - 529.36] clients in their weight losses for
[526.28 - 531.00] movies and celebrities who are models I
[529.36 - 532.60] asked them to brush their teeth maybe
[531.00 - 535.52] not with toothpaste but just with a good
[532.60 - 537.24] toothbrush or a water pick the reason is
[535.52 - 540.28] you know when you eat that lunch and
[537.24 - 542.36] that piece of food remains in your teeth
[540.28 - 544.12] at around 3:30 4:00 in the afternoon
[542.36 - 545.44] suddenly that piece of food dislodges
[544.12 - 547.88] into your mouth and you're like the
[545.44 - 549.92] brain's like Oh by I got some K now I
[547.88 - 553.16] got some food so let me get hungry
[549.92 - 555.68] suddenly so a cleaner mouth is a less
[553.16 - 558.80] hungry mouth you could also look at
[555.68 - 560.72] chewing a sugarless gum which can help
[558.80 - 562.48] you you know release more saliva
[560.72 - 565.32] cleaning up your teeth now the habit of
[562.48 - 568.96] reaching for a sweet snack between meals
[565.32 - 571.92] Like Biscuits or sweets can be reduced
[568.96 - 574.96] so you will find it easier to stick to
[571.92 - 576.68] healthier snacks like fruits or nuts and
[574.96 - 578.92] you'll be satiated to because these are
[576.68 - 581.32] healthier and they actually fill up your
[578.92 - 583.72] tummy but they're more natural and they
[581.32 - 586.40] don't have these artificial added sugars
[583.72 - 588.16] in them the other point is I have
[586.40 - 590.04] personally experienced this so when I
[588.16 - 592.04] want to put on weight I eat a lot of
[590.04 - 594.60] food and invariably there's a lot of
[592.04 - 597.52] sugar in it but I get a lot of stiffness
[594.60 - 599.80] in my joints now the moment you reduce
[597.52 - 602.00] sugar you will actually in exp erience
[599.80 - 603.68] less inflammation pain and stiffness in
[602.00 - 605.72] fact a lot of people have uric acid as
[603.68 - 609.12] an issue and one of the conditions is
[605.72 - 611.76] everyone says reduce your nonv protein
[609.12 - 614.84] but let me tell you reducing your sugar
[611.76 - 616.88] has an more equally powerful impact on
[614.84 - 619.20] dropping your uric acid and dropping
[616.88 - 621.80] your pain stiffness and inflammation
[619.20 - 624.40] this will also result in lower blood
[621.80 - 626.64] pressure and those of you have to take
[624.40 - 629.00] arthritic medicines or anti-inflammatory
[626.64 - 631.92] medications just try dropping sugar from
[629.00 - 634.40] your diet diet for 7 to 8 weeks trust me
[631.92 - 637.00] you will see a massive change in all the
[634.40 - 638.76] conditions in your body seventh weight
[637.00 - 640.96] loss this is what everybody on the
[638.76 - 642.88] planet comes to my clinic for cutting
[640.96 - 645.12] out sugar will lead to weight loss you
[642.88 - 648.24] know this I know this it's common sense
[645.12 - 650.20] but when you do this you will get
[648.24 - 652.72] amazing results you will lose water
[650.20 - 654.28] weight initially as your body stores the
[652.72 - 656.60] release glucose I don't know if you know
[654.28 - 658.80] this but one molecule of glucose stores
[656.60 - 661.56] three molecules of water in the muscle
[658.80 - 663.60] so glycogen basically holds on to three
[661.56 - 666.52] molecules of water so whenever people
[663.60 - 669.76] drop sugar from their diet even for 2
[666.52 - 672.44] days they have a 1 to 3 Kg weight loss
[669.76 - 676.60] because of the water retention inside of
[672.44 - 680.56] the body so we eat a lot of carb heavy
[676.60 - 681.88] Foods in our diet reducing the sugar can
[680.56 - 683.76] significantly help in your weight
[681.88 - 686.52] management you'll suddenly notice that
[683.76 - 689.32] the clothes are getting to fit better
[686.52 - 691.08] and there is a decrease in belly fat
[689.32 - 693.56] Point number eight this is something
[691.08 - 696.20] that every Bollywood celebrity or
[693.56 - 698.48] superstar has asked me can you improve
[696.20 - 701.64] my skin condition yes by reducing sugar
[698.48 - 703.88] there's reduction in acne dermatitis the
[701.64 - 706.20] overall decrease in inflammation will
[703.88 - 709.08] actually make your skin look clowy
[706.20 - 711.80] healthier and less puffy the high
[709.08 - 713.96] glycemic index of many Indian sweets can
[711.80 - 715.92] actually lead to skin problems cutting
[713.96 - 718.40] out sugar can result in clearer skin and
[715.92 - 719.92] a more radiant complexion in fact I
[718.40 - 723.52] challenge you
[719.92 - 725.60] go for a 14-day sugar reduction no sugar
[723.52 - 728.16] at all you may feel difficult in the
[725.60 - 730.44] first 3 to 5 days but just take pictures

[730.44 - 734.84] Glow with every photograph same time of
