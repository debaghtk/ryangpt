Transcript:
[0.20 - 3.20] well my profession says I'm a
[1.56 - 5.12] nutritionist but I think I'm also a
[3.20 - 7.04] chartered accountant you know why like a
[5.12 - 9.52] chartered accountant who does debit and
[7.04 - 11.76] credit a nutritionist also does calorie
[9.52 - 13.64] consumption and calorie expenditure a
[11.76 - 16.16] credit and a debit now I had the
[13.64 - 18.76] privilege of presenting my viewpoint on
[16.16 - 20.96] taxation for the wellness and healthcare
[18.76 - 23.56] industry now you know that Medical Care
[20.96 - 26.12] does not have GST it's not taxed but
[23.56 - 27.88] nutrition services exercise services and
[26.12 - 30.00] many Wellness Services come under the
[27.88 - 31.60] gamut of GST and I recently had the
[30.00 - 35.32] privilege of meeting our finance
[31.60 - 38.28] minister shrimati nirmala sitaraman now
[35.32 - 41.04] I presented to her why nutrition plans
[38.28 - 43.76] should not have a GST in addition to
[41.04 - 46.72] many requests like a medical vacation as
[43.76 - 49.48] well as allowing taxable India to claim
[46.72 - 52.36] deductible expenses on domestic help
[49.48 - 54.52] which allows creation of more jobs super
[52.36 - 57.28] excited I just got to meet the Finance
[54.52 - 60.32] Minister of India uh a big thanks to the
[57.28 - 62.40] state BJP economic cell for giving the
[60.32 - 64.60] opportunity to present as an
[62.40 - 66.76] entrepreneur in the healthcare space I
[64.60 - 68.96] submitted my questions to her you can
[66.76 - 70.64] watch the private interaction with ma'am
[68.96 - 73.72] and she answered in fielded questions
[70.64 - 76.04] from 14 or 15 of us from the industry I
[73.72 - 79.56] spoke about how nutrition and wellness
[76.04 - 82.08] space should have a lower GST tax regime
[79.56 - 84.08] and know a lot of Medical Care is
[82.08 - 87.04] required in India we're going to be the
[84.08 - 89.80] youngest but the sickest population you
[87.04 - 91.80] can hear the ambulance behind us uh you
[89.80 - 93.00] know you know what we need to take care
[91.80 - 95.52] of
[93.00 - 97.04] people and we can't wait till an
[95.52 - 99.12] ambulance has to come and pick you up
[97.04 - 100.72] right so I talk to her about as a
[99.12 - 102.48] nutritionist I'm a first generation
[100.72 - 107.00] entrepreneur probably the youngest in
[102.48 - 110.28] this room I employ about 168 people 90%
[107.00 - 111.96] of them are women and we do diet plans
[110.28 - 115.68] so one of the things that is coming from
[111.96 - 117.64] consumers is medicine is not under GST
[115.68 - 121.00] could you make Allied Services like
[117.64 - 123.00] nutrition gyms yoga so one of the
[121.00 - 126.44] thought process was could we go in that
[123.00 - 128.72] direction of lesser GST or no GST is a
[126.44 - 131.00] possibility if not at least the Medical
[128.72 - 132.80] Nutrition cases because when we have
[131.00 - 136.04] Standalone private businesses and we are
[132.80 - 138.80] not in hospitals it is a difficulty with
[136.04 - 144.16] regards to creating of more jobs in the
[138.80 - 148.12] country I feel that um yoga gym trainers
[144.16 - 150.40] dieticians we I can service around 300
[148.12 - 153.04] people a year and earn an income pay my
[150.40 - 154.72] taxes people can also recruit such
[153.04 - 158.56] people so if we
[154.72 - 161.68] Empower this industry of Wellness India
[158.56 - 163.96] currently largest population youngest
[161.68 - 167.00] Workforce but we will be the sickest
[163.96 - 169.40] youngest population in the world so as a
[167.00 - 173.52] nutritionist I'm trying to think how do
[169.40 - 176.00] we get people to do more on their own so
[173.52 - 178.68] my request would be is could you give
[176.00 - 180.76] deductions diet plans medical test
[178.68 - 183.72] Health screenings my parents health
[180.76 - 186.52] screening that I pay for um and also in
[183.72 - 188.68] addition to that medical vacations is a
[186.52 - 190.84] thought that came from my team uh people
[188.68 - 193.48] are traveling outside the country could
[190.84 - 196.60] we create uh Retreats and centers and
[193.48 - 198.92] blue zones in India where people will go
[196.60 - 200.56] and spend their money and their health
[198.92 - 202.96] is taken care of so India is taking care
[200.56 - 206.04] of its Health on the face of it it
[202.96 - 207.80] sounds fine and I agree health and you
[206.04 - 210.64] know Wellness will have to be given all
[207.80 - 213.40] that care and attention but is it only
[210.64 - 215.80] through taxation and if it is through
[213.40 - 218.16] taxation only then I have to see the
[215.80 - 219.68] ramifications I think India would like
[218.16 - 222.52] to probably instead of spending on
[219.68 - 224.40] movies and outside food um we should
[222.52 - 225.92] incentivize them to spend on Healthcare
[224.40 - 227.96] they should tell kataka government to
[225.92 - 229.80] mock tax
[227.96 - 231.48] entertainment I'd like to take care of
[229.80 - 234.44] your health
[231.48 - 236.72] ma'am again I also talked about
[234.44 - 239.40] Healthcare screening blood test and all
[236.72 - 241.24] of these things in addition to Medical
[239.40 - 243.44] vacation where you and I should take
[241.24 - 244.96] holidays for our health and could it be
[243.44 - 247.24] part of tax deductible now I know this
[244.96 - 250.20] is visual thinking do you have any
[247.24 - 252.28] comments about how we can improve
[250.20 - 254.24] Healthcare so what I want you to do is
[252.28 - 256.80] fill in the comment box below with your
[254.24 - 259.00] ideas because I'll Cate these ideas with
[256.80 - 261.60] my team at the qua nutrition clinics and
[259.00 - 264.00] if I get a chance to meet with the
[261.60 - 266.40] government again I would definitely Cate
[264.00 - 268.48] and crystallize a lot of the best ideas
[266.40 - 270.96] that you and I are the arm admy that we
[268.48 - 275.20] can present to the Finance Minister and
[270.96 - 275.20] maybe even the prime minister of India
