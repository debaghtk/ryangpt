[168.64 - 175.24] in bopal yes we're starting a Pilatus
[171.72 - 176.80] studio in bopal and uh we're partnering
[175.24 - 179.24] with them and yesterday was the soft
[176.80 - 180.44] launch of that your journey has been
[179.24 - 182.60] extensive
[180.44 - 185.12] did you start off as a Pilatus
[182.60 - 187.00] instructor what was your story and cuz
[185.12 - 191.92] it's many years in the making of your
[187.00 - 194.68] Empire so it's a really uh different
[191.92 - 198.36] story I was a very different person as a
[194.68 - 201.64] teenager I was super lazy I never worked
[198.36 - 205.32] out I hated the idea of moving
[201.64 - 207.64] physically I would watch TV and uh eat
[205.32 - 211.64] samosas and bajas
[207.64 - 215.12] and once again you would eat s Bas and
[211.64 - 218.12] all of that piz and I could eat a full
[215.12 - 221.00] Pizza just by myself what was the
[218.12 - 225.36] switch there wasn't really a switch that
[221.00 - 228.72] happened uh when I was around 17 my best
[225.36 - 231.52] friend 18 my best friend fell in love
[228.72 - 233.52] and she wanted to look good and lose a
[231.52 - 236.00] little bit of weight and we just had
[233.52 - 238.88] this new health spa that had opened in
[236.00 - 241.48] our city in in bandra where I live
[238.88 - 244.72] called 10 the Health Spa which had uh
[241.48 - 248.36] saa's team and they had a a very unique
[244.72 - 249.56] membership in like I'm talking about n
[248.36 - 252.20] late
[249.56 - 255.36] 1980s where they said two for the price
[252.20 - 258.40] of one and we were in college couldn't
[255.36 - 260.16] for it no she forced me I had no
[258.40 - 261.96] intention of going she was like because
[260.16 - 263.60] she didn't want to pay the full price
[261.96 - 265.84] she was like there's this amazing you
[263.60 - 268.84] know why don't you join with me I said
[265.84 - 270.68] exercise me not happening she said come
[268.84 - 273.80] on you you eat eat more than all the
[270.68 - 275.12] boys we know you don't move at all I
[273.80 - 276.84] think you should come with me and if
[275.12 - 279.80] you're my best friend and you love me
[276.84 - 282.00] you'll do this so there I went you know
[279.80 - 284.88] emotionally back blackmailed my my best
[282.00 - 287.36] friend went into the studio she knew
[284.88 - 289.40] exactly what she wanted to do uh she
[287.36 - 291.64] went into the weight section started
[289.40 - 293.88] doing some leg extension I didn't even
[291.64 - 296.84] know what those machines were I was
[293.88 - 298.48] walking around I saw this uh Studio
[296.84 - 300.96] where people were dancing it said
[298.48 - 304.56] aerobics and and as a teenager I thought
[300.96 - 306.92] I was a great dancer mhm I walked in
[304.56 - 309.76] thinking I've totally got this went and
[306.92 - 311.48] stood right in front entered late went
[309.76 - 312.96] and stood right in front and front of
[311.48 - 316.20] the mirror because I wanted to check
[312.96 - 317.84] myself out did everything wrong uh
[316.20 - 319.72] because I realized that I had no
[317.84 - 322.16] coordination skills that are required
[319.72 - 326.28] for aerobics probably kicked a few
[322.16 - 329.16] people or B B B bumped into a few people
[326.28 - 331.76] uh finished the class and they all gave
[329.16 - 334.16] me the dirtiest look and they were like
[331.76 - 336.44] you don't belong here what are you doing
[334.16 - 339.12] here I was so embarrassed and
[336.44 - 341.04] disappointed in myself that I kept going
[339.12 - 344.20] back to that class because I wanted to
[341.04 - 347.12] prove to myself that I can't be so bad
[344.20 - 349.56] at something and one day the instructor
[347.12 - 352.00] was unwell she called me up and in those
[349.56 - 353.68] days we had phones at home right no
[352.00 - 357.16] mobile she called me up and she said can
[353.68 - 359.48] you teach my class today I'm not feeling
[357.16 - 361.00] well and I was shocked I said what do
[359.48 - 363.44] you you mean teach your class I don't
[361.00 - 365.08] know how to teach aerobics and she said
[363.44 - 367.88] there are cassettes this was the
[365.08 - 370.64] cassette age just play any cassette you
[367.88 - 372.68] like and do whatever comes to your mind
[370.64 - 374.72] said okay I went I put in a cassette I
[372.68 - 376.88] said hey guys I'm teaching the class
[374.72 - 379.04] today and they all laughed and they said
[376.88 - 382.40] yeah right like we're now going to do
[379.04 - 384.84] rubbish I put the cassette and to my
[382.40 - 388.24] astonishment and the people who I was
[384.84 - 390.84] teaching I knew the entire 10 song
[388.24 - 394.48] routine like every song Every Beat I
[390.84 - 397.56] could even uh instruct them because in
[394.48 - 400.08] my memory subconscious i' I'd heard the
[397.56 - 402.44] teacher so many times that I was giving
[400.08 - 405.04] instructions at the end of the class I
[402.44 - 407.00] think more than the people being
[405.04 - 409.56] surprised I was surprised that I could
[407.00 - 411.32] teach the full class and they said when
[409.56 - 413.08] did you learn and I said I didn't she
[411.32 - 414.96] just that was the start of your journey
[413.08 - 417.20] that was the start of my journey not
[414.96 - 420.04] really after that the instructor
[417.20 - 421.60] actually the instructor was um pregnant
[420.04 - 424.12] that's why she couldn't make it and she
[421.60 - 425.80] was teaching an afternoon class so she
[424.12 - 428.56] said after college would you like to
[425.80 - 431.44] come and teach this class I'll pay you
[428.56 - 433.36] said okay and yeah that that's how it
[431.44 - 435.72] started so I would go to college I would
[433.36 - 438.24] come back earn this pocket money and
[435.72 - 440.04] then after I completed graduation and
[438.24 - 445.32] then I got hooked I would go to that
[440.04 - 447.96] class every day you know show off uh and
[445.32 - 450.64] when I was going to the US after I
[447.96 - 452.68] completed graduation for a uh I was
[450.64 - 455.08] working at we had something called Camp
[452.68 - 457.48] America where Indians would go to
[455.08 - 459.60] America and work in summer camps and
[457.48 - 462.92] you'd get paid so I was going there and
[459.60 - 464.52] she said why don't you go uh do a course
[462.92 - 467.76] because in those days nobody was
[464.52 - 470.24] certified in India and of course my
[467.76 - 471.88] confidence always took the better of me
[470.24 - 474.08] I said yeah I could teach a class
[471.88 - 477.48] without being trained I can go to a
[474.08 - 480.08] course how difficult can it be it was
[477.48 - 483.32] Bloody difficult if I can say so I
[480.08 - 487.68] failed because your passing percentage
[483.32 - 489.88] is 75 plus and we are used to 35% this
[487.68 - 492.32] is the Pilatus of course no this is
[489.88 - 494.12] aerobic instructor training so even
[492.32 - 497.88] aerobic instructor training in the US is
[494.12 - 499.64] a 75% pass yes so the first time you
[497.88 - 501.88] took it little lightly yeah I took it
[499.64 - 505.76] very lightly and you needed to know
[501.88 - 508.68] Anatomy uh I was a Arts student at at uh
[505.76 - 511.12] graduated in economics I knew nothing
[508.68 - 514.04] about the gastro nus it took me 3 Days
[511.12 - 517.84] To Say the word and I love saying it now
[514.04 - 520.60] because I had to PR gastro gastro gastro
[517.84 - 523.60] so it was it was really funny but I went
[520.60 - 526.52] back and red the exam and of course got
[523.60 - 529.60] certified came back uh my dream was to
[526.52 - 532.68] be a school teacher to teach little kids
[529.60 - 534.64] I love toddlers so I came back I did my
[532.68 - 536.72] Early Childhood care and education I
[534.64 - 538.72] used to teach in a school in the morning
[536.72 - 541.40] and run aerobic classes in the evening
[538.72 - 544.88] till I had my own children and then I
[541.40 - 547.24] realized that I used up all the patience
[544.88 - 550.64] that I had in my school that when I came
[547.24 - 553.36] home I didn't have enough for my older
[550.64 - 555.12] son I had only one then and I would be
[553.36 - 558.00] impatient and I said okay this is not
[555.12 - 560.32] fair so I stopped teaching and then I
[558.00 - 562.08] did a personal training course so I
[560.32 - 564.52] thought okay I'll go to people's houses
[562.08 - 566.48] and do personal training and then in the
[564.52 - 568.68] evenings I would do my aerobic class so
[566.48 - 571.00] then I did a personal training course
[568.68 - 572.72] became a person personal trainer did
[571.00 - 577.20] that for
[572.72 - 579.00] about 8 years and then I had my sec in
[577.20 - 581.80] that time had my second son had this
[579.00 - 583.80] little abdominal fat that I did 100
[581.80 - 585.80] crunches I did a thousand crunches I
[583.80 - 587.72] could never get rid of started
[585.80 - 591.00] researching on the internet what can I
[587.72 - 593.52] do to get rid of my abdominal uh flab
[591.00 - 595.40] and out came the word Pilatus which I
[593.52 - 597.96] was like what is this
[595.40 - 600.16] pilots and then I researched which are
[597.96 - 602.44] the best Studios how do I do teachers
[600.16 - 604.32] training found the studio in the US so
[602.44 - 606.32] this was first for you personally of
[604.32 - 610.12] course okay everything is always first
[606.32 - 613.08] for me okay I come on top of the pyramid
[610.12 - 615.36] and then I found Pilatus and I called up
[613.08 - 617.20] the school first I saw the word Pilatus
[615.36 - 619.96] and then saw who in India teaches
[617.20 - 622.36] Pilatus and nobody did then I found a
[619.96 - 624.44] school in America and I said I want to
[622.36 - 626.80] become a Pilatus instructor it was in
[624.44 - 629.84] California and they said oh great how
[626.80 - 632.16] many years of uh practice do you have
[629.84 - 634.64] and I said zero and they said the
[632.16 - 637.72] prerequisite is that you have to be you
[634.64 - 640.16] have to be practicing Pilatus for a year
[637.72 - 642.28] before you can come and do the course
[640.16 - 644.72] the course and I said nobody in India
[642.28 - 647.36] teaches Pilatus so they sent me some
[644.72 - 649.88] DVDs and they said watch this practice
[647.36 - 653.44] for you know a few months at least I saw
[649.88 - 655.44] it the rollup looked like a situp the
[653.44 - 657.76] chest lift looked like a crunch and I
[655.44 - 659.40] called them I said I do all of this why
[657.76 - 662.16] are you telling me to practice this you
[659.40 - 663.92] know I'm from India I do yoga I teach
[662.16 - 665.84] you know I'm a personal trainer by then
[663.92 - 668.28] I was a personal trainer for about 15
[665.84 - 672.76] years where was this in the US
[668.28 - 675.08] California in uh Orange County ah okay
[672.76 - 676.88] uh yeah so I packed my bags they said
[675.08 - 679.72] listen we want to just warn you it's
[676.88 - 682.60] tough and how long was the first says
[679.72 - 684.56] tough to me something lights up like
[682.60 - 687.00] there's a light bu pulp that goes up
[684.56 - 689.64] saying I've got this if someone says
[687.00 - 692.68] tough means I have to prove that I can
[689.64 - 695.40] do it even more uh how long was it well
[692.68 - 697.32] I went to do matte Pilatus because I
[695.40 - 699.92] didn't even know what equipment Pilatus
[697.32 - 703.96] meant or what equipment was so I signed
[699.92 - 707.60] up for Matt Pilatus which was 6 weeks so
[703.96 - 709.88] Yasmin for the uninitiated out there
[707.60 - 712.04] what is matte Pilatus and what is
[709.88 - 715.72] equipment Pilatus and is there any other
[712.04 - 718.40] Pilatus so matte Pilatus is Pilatus on a
[715.72 - 720.76] mat you don't require any props you can
[718.40 - 723.52] just do Pilatus like you do yoga on a
[720.76 - 725.44] mat with if unless you're doing aanga or
[723.52 - 727.88] you know something else it's just the
[725.44 - 730.04] mat and you which is what I went to do
[727.88 - 734.08] Pilatus in itself is the perfect
[730.04 - 736.88] combination of strength and stretch uh
[734.08 - 739.32] equipment Pilatus is Pilatus done on an
[736.88 - 742.36] equipment the equipment is what you have
[739.32 - 744.28] to import from all over from the US
[742.36 - 746.68] right now
[744.28 - 749.48] basically and you do it on different
[746.68 - 752.32] equipments which were made by Jo Joseph
[749.48 - 753.96] Pilatus who was the founder of Pilatus
[752.32 - 756.72] ah so there was a person who founded
[753.96 - 759.20] Pilatus and his name name was Josephus
[756.72 - 761.16] okay is it true I read somewhere that uh
[759.20 - 764.64] it was designed for patients and
[761.16 - 770.12] hospitals it was designed during World
[764.64 - 772.64] War I okay uh when uh Joseph patus was
[770.12 - 775.56] in an internment camp he was working
[772.64 - 778.60] with injured soldiers and there were
[775.56 - 780.36] these soldiers after the war without a
[778.60 - 783.60] limb with without two Limbs and he
[780.36 - 786.16] started developing this program for them
[783.60 - 788.72] to keep just keep healthy keep fit build
[786.16 - 791.04] their immunity so they would be on their
[788.72 - 794.92] beds and he would use the Springs of the
[791.04 - 797.60] beds to make them do exercises and Rehab
[794.92 - 800.00] ah and that's how the machines came in
[797.60 - 802.08] and if you look at the machines all our
[800.00 - 806.08] machines Pilatus machines are spring
[802.08 - 808.20] based like in that time they had bed
[806.08 - 811.12] springs very interesting so it was
[808.20 - 813.84] developed by a man for
[811.12 - 816.76] men and you were in California Orange
[813.84 - 819.04] County Learning the matte Pilatus I was
[816.76 - 822.56] I went there to learn the Matt Pilatus a
[819.04 - 825.32] 6 we course my kids were that was in
[822.56 - 827.92] 2006 they were 6 and 8 so my in-laws
[825.32 - 830.44] came in to live with them while I went
[827.92 - 832.56] to do this and when I went the first day
[830.44 - 834.92] I was jet lagged I went I did my course
[832.56 - 836.96] went back and slept the second day I was
[834.92 - 839.16] a little more alert I went at it so it
[836.96 - 841.36] was the first half of the day that they
[839.16 - 842.76] did the math training and then after
[841.36 - 845.72] that they were doing the equipment
[842.76 - 848.16] training the second day I stayed back to
[845.72 - 850.24] see what are they doing when I go home
[848.16 - 853.08] and I saw the equipment and I fell in
[850.24 - 856.08] love I was like I have to bring this
[853.08 - 858.20] back to my country and so I went and met
[856.08 - 860.12] the teacher and I said I want to do this
[858.20 - 862.56] he said well you've just signed up for
[860.12 - 864.36] Matt and you've already missed two days
[862.56 - 867.32] of equipment I said I'll make it up I'll
[864.36 - 869.68] do extra classes and whatever so he said
[867.32 - 872.20] but the equipment training is 12
[869.68 - 874.84] weeks I had already booked my tickets so
[872.20 - 877.16] I called up my in-laws and I said I want
[874.84 - 880.16] to do this training and the instructors
[877.16 - 883.36] allowed me to break it up 6 weeks now 6
[880.16 - 885.32] weeks come back after 6 months and so
[883.36 - 887.48] they said and that's when you have
[885.32 - 890.36] supportive you know family and they said
[887.48 - 893.32] beta whatever you want to do you do you
[890.36 - 895.84] go back and do it that was so beautiful
[893.32 - 899.32] yeah so that's how my journey began for
[895.84 - 901.56] pil arst so when you said that you saw
[899.32 - 903.92] the equipment and you said you have to
[901.56 - 906.52] bring this back to the country what was
[903.92 - 908.64] clicking in your head at that time is it
[906.52 - 910.84] that you were already a personal trainer
[908.64 - 914.00] You' done aerobic classes taught aerobic
[910.84 - 917.48] classes and you saw something because
[914.00 - 919.52] today you have many studios you have
[917.48 - 921.48] many people have trained under you right
[919.52 - 922.48] but at that moment as an entrepreneur I
[921.48 - 924.60] don't think you were an entrepreneur
[922.48 - 926.00] were you an entrepreneur that time no
[924.60 - 930.08] but then you said I had to bring it back
[926.00 - 932.16] to India so why what was the trigger the
[930.08 - 934.60] thing with me Ryan is when I like
[932.16 - 937.36] something or when I love something and I
[934.60 - 939.28] see something different and when I use
[937.36 - 941.08] it and I know how effective it is I want
[939.28 - 945.08] to share it with people and which year
[941.08 - 948.28] was this 2006 and at that time Pilatus
[945.08 - 950.76] was unknown in India yeah nobody knew
[948.28 - 953.76] what it was so it was it was actually a
[950.76 - 955.56] gamble but I like gambling I like
[953.76 - 957.60] gambling with health and did you import
[955.56 - 959.16] the first Pilatus reform EV what did the
[957.60 - 961.04] custom say to you when they got that
[959.16 - 963.80] equipment did they pass it through it
[961.04 - 964.88] was yeah you had to just pay custom duty
[963.80 - 967.64] I'm thinking they were like why was this
[964.88 - 970.52] lady importing this bed with spring
[967.64 - 974.00] thing is I actually acquired an import
[970.52 - 976.16] export license to import this machine
[974.00 - 977.76] the machine anyway is expensive in
[976.16 - 980.00] America but by the time it comes to
[977.76 - 981.92] India it's double the cost so I told
[980.00 - 984.56] them which is the cheapest reformer that
[981.92 - 986.40] I can import uh the customer doesn't
[984.56 - 988.28] care and if you're paying your duties
[986.40 - 991.16] you can get in whatever but you have to
[988.28 - 993.56] be willing to so I imported one machine
[991.16 - 996.24] which was a combination of the reformer
[993.56 - 998.36] and the Cadillac and I imported the W
[996.24 - 1001.00] chair so I imported these three things
[998.36 - 1002.80] because I had to also go back to do my
[1001.00 - 1004.88] exam to do the rest of the course so I
[1002.80 - 1007.48] was like if I come back to India how
[1004.88 - 1009.36] will I practice what I've learned
[1007.48 - 1011.60] because when you do the second half you
[1009.36 - 1014.08] have to give an exam so that they know
[1011.60 - 1016.56] that you've you know done you've learned
[1014.08 - 1019.16] successfully before you indulge in the
[1016.56 - 1021.64] advance so I had to bring it back back I
[1019.16 - 1023.64] had to practice on myself we had teacher
[1021.64 - 1026.40] training hours that we had to put in
[1023.64 - 1028.20] where you practice on different bodies
[1026.40 - 1031.08] and you know You' learn how to train
[1028.20 - 1034.60] because we have a two-fold uh ex
[1031.08 - 1036.88] examination one is a written three-fold
[1034.60 - 1039.20] one is written one is they tell you
[1036.88 - 1041.28] exercises and you perform them and one
[1039.20 - 1043.52] is a whole hour where you're teaching
[1041.28 - 1046.28] somebody else and they observe you
[1043.52 - 1049.32] teaching them so so it's not an easy
[1046.28 - 1051.68] exam to pass not at all not at all are
[1049.32 - 1053.92] there different levels in Pilatus to
[1051.68 - 1056.48] become an instructor there a basic level
[1053.92 - 1060.00] and so what are those so the first level
[1056.48 - 1062.48] is Matt Pilatus which is really really
[1060.00 - 1065.00] important for you to do because that is
[1062.48 - 1067.64] like your foundation right so your
[1065.00 - 1070.04] foundation has to be super strong for
[1067.64 - 1073.16] you to construct a building and then you
[1070.04 - 1075.08] do reformer after reformer you do chair
[1073.16 - 1077.52] after chair you do Cadillac and then you
[1075.08 - 1080.20] do the barrels and once you've done this
[1077.52 - 1081.96] all you give an examle ination and you
[1080.20 - 1084.72] become a comprehensive trainer but you
[1081.96 - 1087.28] can also be different levels of trainer
[1084.72 - 1090.00] so now that I'm a teacher I'm I'm a
[1087.28 - 1092.36] master instructor where I train my
[1090.00 - 1095.40] trainers I only do match with some
[1092.36 - 1098.12] people who don't have the luxury of
[1095.40 - 1100.80] having equipment so they do only maths
[1098.12 - 1102.88] then with maths we add props so you can
[1100.80 - 1104.60] do maths with a ball you can do it with
[1102.88 - 1107.76] terab bands you can do it with teral
[1104.60 - 1109.84] loops and then you do reformer so there
[1107.76 - 1113.92] are different levels where you train
[1109.84 - 1115.60] people um even in Matt we have mat 1 2 3
[1113.92 - 1118.12] so if you just want to start out your
[1115.60 - 1120.28] Pilates career you do mat one you start
[1118.12 - 1123.32] teaching you get the experience you come
[1120.28 - 1126.92] back you do Mat 2 and are these
[1123.32 - 1129.76] examinations conducted now in India yes
[1126.92 - 1132.20] by you conduct these examinations and
[1129.76 - 1135.32] right now I'm is there any paper leaking
[1132.20 - 1137.20] happening in this examinations and all
[1135.32 - 1140.16] no so how good do you have to be to
[1137.20 - 1142.28] become a a Pilatus INR so the thing is
[1140.16 - 1145.60] paper leaking sorry to cut you but the
[1142.28 - 1147.88] paper leaking can it's an open book exam
[1145.60 - 1150.72] ah it's an open book exam open book exam
[1147.88 - 1153.52] the theory is something else but your
[1150.72 - 1155.68] practical how are you going to cheat so
[1153.52 - 1158.72] the reason I I went in that direction is
[1155.68 - 1162.12] because there are two people that need
[1158.72 - 1165.32] to hear this one is I want to become a
[1162.12 - 1167.48] fitness instructor and the other is I
[1165.32 - 1170.64] want to be trained by a fitness
[1167.48 - 1172.48] instructor so so a lot of women you're
[1170.64 - 1174.80] very inspirational to a lot of women two
[1172.48 - 1177.36] children two boys you went to the US
[1174.80 - 1178.72] your family support is there but a lot
[1177.36 - 1181.20] of women do not take care of their
[1178.72 - 1184.04] bodies and doing
[1181.20 - 1186.36] workouts is one great asset in my
[1184.04 - 1190.12] opinion that a woman can give back to
[1186.36 - 1192.44] her body which is the time for herself
[1190.12 - 1195.80] to take care of her body and the workout
[1192.44 - 1198.68] is one so for those who are getting
[1195.80 - 1200.60] inspired by you I want you to know what
[1198.68 - 1202.44] what was some of the early challenges
[1200.60 - 1204.76] you talked about you know traveling jet
[1202.44 - 1207.28] lag and all but those are uh maybe
[1204.76 - 1210.32] logistical uh challenges what are the
[1207.28 - 1213.52] other challenges you faced as a woman
[1210.32 - 1217.12] was money difficult was time difficult
[1213.52 - 1218.48] was uh people's commend difficult was um
[1217.12 - 1221.20] like oh you know how can you take care
[1218.48 - 1223.96] of two children and go for classes did
[1221.20 - 1225.84] you face some of these issues so I think
[1223.96 - 1227.88] the biggest challenge comes from your
[1225.84 - 1229.84] spouse sometimes because he says you
[1227.88 - 1233.40] have no time to do this and you have no
[1229.84 - 1235.16] time to do that but as women we are
[1233.40 - 1237.56] gifted with being
[1235.16 - 1240.44] multitaskers right we manage our time so
[1237.56 - 1243.00] from an early age I knew that I wanted
[1240.44 - 1244.96] to give my kids quality instead of
[1243.00 - 1246.48] quantity I was never that mother who
[1244.96 - 1248.72] woke up and dropped them to school to
[1246.48 - 1251.32] feel that importance or who would want
[1248.72 - 1253.84] to hear when I'm abroad that my kids are
[1251.32 - 1256.72] missing me you know I've always made my
[1253.84 - 1259.04] boys independent and come to me when you
[1256.72 - 1261.36] have problems and you need me I'm always
[1259.04 - 1264.36] there so even when I started working I
[1261.36 - 1267.32] worked my schedule around them I would
[1264.36 - 1269.00] be home when they left for school I
[1267.32 - 1271.40] would be home when they came back from
[1269.00 - 1274.64] school so the first Studio that I
[1271.40 - 1276.96] started was in my house in my living in
[1274.64 - 1279.48] my guest room so that's a pivotal moment
[1276.96 - 1282.32] in your life just adapting everything
[1279.48 - 1285.36] your desire to be a career woman and at
[1282.32 - 1288.64] the same time be a family woman you had
[1285.36 - 1292.72] them kind of so I would like to say Ryan
[1288.64 - 1295.48] into this that my career goals were
[1292.72 - 1298.40] being a teacher they were not being an
[1295.48 - 1300.16] instructor right my my whole like from
[1298.40 - 1302.88] the time I remember what I wanted to do
[1300.16 - 1305.60] it was teach children and that's what I
[1302.88 - 1307.92] gave up when I had my own children
[1305.60 - 1310.56] because I felt like I was not giving my
[1307.92 - 1312.72] children quality mhm because when I came
[1310.56 - 1315.08] home I didn't have patience but I had
[1312.72 - 1316.88] patience for other people's children
[1315.08 - 1319.28] right and then I decided okay now that
[1316.88 - 1321.16] I'm home let me become a personal
[1319.28 - 1324.28] trainer because Fitness is a second
[1321.16 - 1327.24] choice that I've made and that became my
[1324.28 - 1329.48] career because as I went and you know
[1327.24 - 1331.84] this being a you know nutritionist being
[1329.48 - 1334.12] into the health space the more you go
[1331.84 - 1336.44] into Health there's so much you need to
[1334.12 - 1339.00] learn there's so much you need to try
[1336.44 - 1340.64] and test there's so it's not about okay
[1339.00 - 1343.00] I've done this course now I can train
[1340.64 - 1344.84] paper right it's not like you can do a
[1343.00 - 1346.76] certification and then you know
[1344.84 - 1348.72] everything and you can be there as
[1346.76 - 1350.76] people change as people have different
[1348.72 - 1353.84] needs you have to constantly evolve you
[1350.76 - 1356.28] have to constantly uh dive deeper into
[1353.84 - 1359.20] what you know to know more so I'm
[1356.28 - 1361.20] constantly finding out what it is that
[1359.20 - 1363.20] will help the current body in front of
[1361.20 - 1365.24] me is there a difference when you say
[1363.20 - 1367.72] you know you have to constantly certify
[1365.24 - 1369.28] yourself or Healthcare is a deep dive
[1367.72 - 1372.12] pit because you learn something and then
[1369.28 - 1374.28] something else is a deeper part of that
[1372.12 - 1378.12] science is there a difference between
[1374.28 - 1380.44] just being a fitness Pilatus instructor
[1378.12 - 1382.04] teacher teaching oneon-one or a class
[1380.44 - 1385.16] and is there a difference between being
[1382.04 - 1387.28] a teacher definitely so we have this
[1385.16 - 1390.48] when when I did this uh certification
[1387.28 - 1393.52] caused by Fletcher um we learned who is
[1390.48 - 1397.08] Fletcher Fletcher is a school of Pilatus
[1393.52 - 1399.60] ah so Ron Fletcher was a pupil of Joseph
[1397.08 - 1403.52] Pilatus okay and he started his own
[1399.60 - 1405.84] school and uh he said I mean when I was
[1403.52 - 1408.12] doing the Fletcher uh teacher training
[1405.84 - 1410.88] my instructor there my teacher there
[1408.12 - 1414.20] said you first start out as a
[1410.88 - 1416.48] trainer you teach what you know like
[1414.20 - 1418.64] like in the circus you train the animals
[1416.48 - 1421.16] you're training whatever you know then
[1418.64 - 1422.92] you become an instructor so from a
[1421.16 - 1426.00] trainer you've become an instructor now
[1422.92 - 1429.52] you know the instructions you're giving
[1426.00 - 1431.32] have to make sense to people so from the
[1429.52 - 1432.92] knowledge that you know now you've
[1431.32 - 1434.44] you've taught that taught that taught
[1432.92 - 1437.08] that now you're going to start
[1434.44 - 1439.72] instructing differently and then you
[1437.08 - 1442.52] become a teacher after you become an
[1439.72 - 1445.24] instructor for a period of time now you
[1442.52 - 1447.88] become a teacher when now you're sharing
[1445.24 - 1449.56] your knowledge with other people like
[1447.88 - 1453.16] now I'm a teacher so I share my
[1449.56 - 1455.16] knowledge with other trainers to become
[1453.16 - 1458.44] instructors and then teacher so it's
[1455.16 - 1460.96] constantly evolving so sharing knowledge
[1458.44 - 1464.08] we know that you live in Bombay
[1460.96 - 1466.36] Bollywood comes to you uh we see your
[1464.08 - 1469.08] Instagram profile with the who is who of
[1466.36 - 1472.00] Bollywood Who coming to you uh
[1469.08 - 1473.84] take us back in time where you got your
[1472.00 - 1476.88] first
[1473.84 - 1479.08] celebrity I think I was teaching arobics
[1476.88 - 1482.72] then though I always say it was Karina
[1479.08 - 1485.76] Kapoor but now when I recall she was my
[1482.72 - 1487.96] first personal training celebrity client
[1485.76 - 1490.44] but when I used to do aerobic classes
[1487.96 - 1494.72] which was step aerobic classes and I had
[1490.44 - 1498.80] 20 25 people and I I can't remember the
[1494.72 - 1501.40] first I think no it was Anita Raj okay
[1498.80 - 1503.40] Raj was my first celebrity and she was
[1501.40 - 1505.24] sweating in your aerobic class in my
[1503.40 - 1506.44] aerobic class and she had come out with
[1505.24 - 1510.40] a yoga
[1506.44 - 1513.44] DVD ah because she and then I remember
[1510.40 - 1515.36] thinking oh my God she has her own DVD
[1513.44 - 1518.16] and she's come to workout with me and it
[1515.36 - 1519.76] was a it was a super high for me that
[1518.16 - 1521.44] I'm going to Now train some so that was
[1519.76 - 1523.80] one of your first highs that was my
[1521.44 - 1525.72] first high like oh my God Anita Raj is
[1523.80 - 1527.72] coming to work out with me we're very
[1525.72 - 1530.48] good friends today but yes she was the
[1527.72 - 1532.32] first celebrity that came and then of
[1530.48 - 1534.48] course after that I had a lot of them
[1532.32 - 1537.96] coming in but obviously you know the
[1534.48 - 1540.44] celebrities have this mindset that uh my
[1537.96 - 1542.76] body is the most expensive real estate
[1540.44 - 1545.72] and they invest in their food their diet
[1542.76 - 1549.92] their nutrition the trainers the masio
[1545.72 - 1554.08] even their doctors um in the group of
[1549.92 - 1555.88] Bollywood who do you think has the most
[1554.08 - 1558.36] expensive real estate not the land that
[1555.88 - 1560.88] they buy in Bombay but who do you think
[1558.36 - 1563.28] really spends and invest your time
[1560.88 - 1566.16] effort mental grit into getting that
[1563.28 - 1568.24] great great asset of a body I think we
[1566.16 - 1570.80] have a lot of them right now there's no
[1568.24 - 1572.92] one person and why do all of them have
[1570.80 - 1575.92] that Yas and why does a common man
[1572.92 - 1575.92] always have this excuse
[1575.96 - 1581.40] oh is it about money or is it is a
[1578.48 - 1583.36] mindset so it is a mindset which needs
[1581.40 - 1588.04] to be supported with
[1583.36 - 1589.84] money wise words right so it is so to
[1588.04 - 1593.56] those people that
[1589.84 - 1596.72] say I say all of us who
[1593.56 - 1599.36] are health professionals who have these
[1596.72 - 1603.52] people coming also have a parallel line
[1599.36 - 1605.64] on our YouTube which is free mhm right
[1603.52 - 1608.04] like we you have your podcast you're not
[1605.64 - 1609.88] charging people to watch your podcast
[1608.04 - 1611.68] it's there for you to learn you have
[1609.88 - 1614.04] your online videos I have my online
[1611.68 - 1616.20] videos I have my YouTube videos that I
[1614.04 - 1618.76] take a lot of time and effort to make
[1616.20 - 1621.28] for the common man so I'm I'm like we
[1618.76 - 1623.04] are coming to you but you have to make
[1621.28 - 1626.20] that effort to come to
[1623.04 - 1629.68] us you cannot say like of course we get
[1626.20 - 1629.68] trolled on our Instagram by
[1630.12 - 1636.88] saying or celebrities I say no every
[1633.76 - 1639.12] person is a celebrity in their own right
[1636.88 - 1642.32] and for me you are but you need to take
[1639.12 - 1645.12] that effort to make that decision for
[1642.32 - 1647.32] yourself that I'm going to invest in my
[1645.12 - 1649.44] health and it's not a monetary
[1647.32 - 1652.20] investment all always because people
[1649.44 - 1655.44] like you and me who are true uh
[1652.20 - 1657.96] Believers in our in our work we are
[1655.44 - 1660.80] there for the common man as well free of
[1657.96 - 1663.84] cost they need to make that step towards
[1660.80 - 1667.24] us so I think it's a mind shift and
[1663.84 - 1670.12] speaking of Investments and mind
[1667.24 - 1672.96] shift in the wellness industry as a
[1670.12 - 1675.96] Pilatus trainer when was the investment
[1672.96 - 1679.00] or the aha moment you said that I'm
[1675.96 - 1680.84] going to start making this as a business
[1679.00 - 1684.24] and I'm going to start making it bigger
[1680.84 - 1686.96] or scale up you remember any specific
[1684.24 - 1689.72] timelines no it just organically
[1686.96 - 1693.00] organically happened so for me my aha
[1689.72 - 1694.76] moment actually was the day I started a
[1693.00 - 1696.68] studio in my
[1694.76 - 1698.80] Terrace you first said you started in
[1696.68 - 1700.24] the bedroom right no in my guest room in
[1698.80 - 1702.68] the guest room so I'll tell you this is
[1700.24 - 1705.04] a really interesting uh Journey that I
[1702.68 - 1707.40] had I became a personal trainer after my
[1705.04 - 1709.32] boys were born right so I said okay now
[1707.40 - 1712.00] I can work at at my own time so I used
[1709.32 - 1715.36] to go to people's houses to train them
[1712.00 - 1717.16] this was back in the early 2000 and I
[1715.36 - 1718.92] would go to people's houses to train
[1717.16 - 1720.72] them and come home and then go to
[1718.92 - 1723.04] somebody else's house and train them and
[1720.72 - 1725.80] come home what I realized was people
[1723.04 - 1728.52] weren't serious about me going to them
[1725.80 - 1732.76] because your personal trainer is just an
[1728.52 - 1734.92] extension of your shauer or your uh Doby
[1732.76 - 1737.20] that you're paying a lot more but they
[1734.92 - 1739.00] have to work at your time so if you
[1737.20 - 1741.24] could get a really I was training men
[1739.00 - 1743.08] and they got a really important call I
[1741.24 - 1745.28] had to wait for them while they finish
[1743.08 - 1747.92] their call if I was training women and
[1745.28 - 1750.28] the subzi Wala came or the doobe came or
[1747.92 - 1752.52] the driver came I had to wait for them
[1750.28 - 1755.08] till they finish their conversation it
[1752.52 - 1758.64] wasn't like okay this is my w that this
[1755.08 - 1761.88] individual has come to train me that I
[1758.64 - 1764.28] need to give them my focus time right
[1761.88 - 1767.72] and I hated that feeling they didn't
[1764.28 - 1769.96] value my time so I told my husband we
[1767.72 - 1772.32] had just mve it into our our own flat
[1769.96 - 1774.32] our nuclear family flat and we had a
[1772.32 - 1777.00] guest room I said do you mind if I call
[1774.32 - 1779.44] people home instead of me going to their
[1777.00 - 1781.52] house because now they coming to me I
[1779.44 - 1783.20] can set the rules right I'll have to say
[1781.52 - 1785.72] for 1 hour please put your phone on
[1783.20 - 1788.40] silent and respect my
[1785.72 - 1790.36] time he was and I and he was like are
[1788.40 - 1792.12] you crazy what are you going to now call
[1790.36 - 1794.96] people to our house and I said you know
[1792.12 - 1798.72] the kids are so little and I'll always
[1794.96 - 1801.36] be home for them and that was the that
[1798.72 - 1803.64] yeah that was the yeah so he was like of
[1801.36 - 1806.08] course yeah I think that's a great idea
[1803.64 - 1808.68] so I invested in a few equipment I turn
[1806.08 - 1812.24] my guest room into a studio I was always
[1808.68 - 1815.80] home the boys were very little then they
[1812.24 - 1818.32] were 2 and four literally two and four
[1815.80 - 1820.16] so I was all that stay-at-home mom doing
[1818.32 - 1822.68] my own business people would come in if
[1820.16 - 1823.96] they needed me and that's when I grew
[1822.68 - 1826.80] and then I said okay you know what we
[1823.96 - 1829.64] have a Terrace flat my dream is to have
[1826.80 - 1831.92] a studio on my terce flat which I knew
[1829.64 - 1833.72] the Builder and I told him this is what
[1831.92 - 1836.64] I want to do and he said give me a few
[1833.72 - 1839.84] years to work it out for you in about 2
[1836.64 - 1842.96] years I got this tce and that was my
[1839.84 - 1845.60] dream that was my aha
[1842.96 - 1848.28] moment but that was actually the start
[1845.60 - 1850.16] of the journey before we jump back into
[1848.28 - 1852.44] this conversation with Yasmin I'd like
[1850.16 - 1854.68] to thank our sponsor Cure by Design and

[1922.88 - 1927.24] me all these questions about myself but
[1925.00 - 1930.00] I also have a few questions of my own to
[1927.24 - 1932.44] ask you please go ahead what was your
[1930.00 - 1935.84] journey like well my journey has just
[1932.44 - 1937.92] been very simple um I always sold
[1935.84 - 1939.88] nutritional supplements as a scientist
[1937.92 - 1941.92] as a food scientist as a nutritionist
[1939.88 - 1944.60] okay and when we sold these nutritional
[1941.92 - 1946.68] products uh people said by bolo Dal
[1944.60 - 1949.76] chavel Roti Calen so I always had this
[1946.68 - 1951.44] team of dieticians with me so I had more
[1949.76 - 1954.16] dietitians and salespeople and over a
[1951.44 - 1956.48] period of time I realized hm people are
[1954.16 - 1959.28] actually willing to pay for the
[1956.48 - 1960.72] knowledge on how to construct their food
[1959.28 - 1963.36] which they have learned to eat out of
[1960.72 - 1965.00] love and culture from their parents and
[1963.36 - 1966.68] now they want a little science to come
[1965.00 - 1968.32] into it because they going to the gym
[1966.68 - 1970.24] they're going to people like you they're
[1968.32 - 1971.52] working out like crazy but then they're
[1970.24 - 1974.72] going back and eating whatever
[1971.52 - 1976.40] culturally has been assigned to them and
[1974.72 - 1978.60] sometimes that's not working in an
[1976.40 - 1980.88] aggressive program
[1978.60 - 1983.40] where you want your body to behave in a
[1980.88 - 1986.12] certain way whether it's fat loss it's
[1983.40 - 1988.40] muscle building or you have diabetes
[1986.12 - 1991.08] hypertension people work out they say
[1988.40 - 1993.32] exercise helps a medical condition or a
[1991.08 - 1996.36] lifestyle resolution but then the diet
[1993.32 - 1999.68] is really like not keeping Pace with the
[1996.36 - 2001.16] times so I started uh my chain of quan
[1999.68 - 2003.64] nutrition clinics and that's where I got
[2001.16 - 2005.12] started in terms of scientific practice
[2003.64 - 2009.24] with sports people
[2005.12 - 2011.12] first so some of my first athlet were a
[2009.24 - 2013.04] similar aerobic instructor Like You by
[2011.12 - 2015.68] the name of daas who did the Guinness
[2013.04 - 2018.64] World Record of non-stop aerobics of 26
[2015.68 - 2021.04] hours so I was a person that actually
[2018.64 - 2023.48] wrote down her entire nutrition plan for
[2021.04 - 2026.00] a year because you've got to prepare the
[2023.48 - 2029.04] body you can't suddenly turn up as a
[2026.00 - 2032.32] personal trainer or in a fitness class
[2029.04 - 2034.60] do very very heavy loads and intensity
[2032.32 - 2037.44] without having your nutrition backing
[2034.60 - 2038.40] you and that's the subject of Sports
[2037.44 - 2041.16] Nutrition
[2038.40 - 2042.68] how long back was that was about 2006
[2041.16 - 2045.92] when we did the Guinness World Record of
[2042.68 - 2047.84] non-stop aerobics and then 2008 I won an
[2045.92 - 2049.72] Olympic medal with sushil Kumar I did
[2047.84 - 2052.84] his diet plan for the bronze medal at
[2049.72 - 2055.60] Beijing and we followed that up in the
[2052.84 - 2059.16] next Olympics with a silver medal at the
[2055.60 - 2061.92] London Olympics so the trainers would be
[2059.16 - 2063.24] taking the nutrition plan from me uh or
[2061.92 - 2066.24] they would be the trainers to the
[2063.24 - 2068.08] Olympic level Superstars or athletes so
[2066.24 - 2070.84] they knew that Ryan Fernando would be
[2068.08 - 2074.32] prescribing the diet would be balancing
[2070.84 - 2076.20] out the blood test the genetic test uh
[2074.32 - 2077.76] the food allergy test and then Ryan
[2076.20 - 2080.00] would also look at the supplement
[2077.76 - 2082.68] strategy the nutritional
[2080.00 - 2085.56] supplementation so over a period of time
[2082.68 - 2089.12] the film stars would also work out with
[2085.56 - 2091.56] these supremely gifted trainers because
[2089.12 - 2093.24] they were the best in the industry right
[2091.56 - 2094.88] and they knew that they needed to get a
[2093.24 - 2096.44] Sports Nutrition diet and they knew that
[2094.88 - 2099.28] they would come to Ryan Fernando so my
[2096.44 - 2102.32] journey started with a lot of the
[2099.28 - 2104.68] Bollywood and the Superstar celebrity
[2102.32 - 2106.68] athletes calling me up saying that we
[2104.68 - 2110.24] need your nutrition plan and it was pure
[2106.68 - 2113.24] word of mouth so people always ask me oh
[2110.24 - 2116.44] you're a you're a celebrity nutritionist
[2113.24 - 2119.48] and I always go back and say the famous
[2116.44 - 2122.16] people knew me but the rest of India did
[2119.48 - 2126.08] not know about it and I think the reason
[2122.16 - 2128.92] behind this was that the price that
[2126.08 - 2131.04] astute people wise people people that
[2128.92 - 2132.92] are chasing their dreams and goals they
[2131.04 - 2136.28] put a certain value to what they put
[2132.92 - 2139.24] into their body and they realize that
[2136.28 - 2141.56] what they've been taught in society may
[2139.24 - 2144.64] not be the right version of food to
[2141.56 - 2146.80] enter the body and so they start hunting
[2144.64 - 2148.48] who's this person we need to go to
[2146.80 - 2150.72] change the way we eat and that's how
[2148.48 - 2152.20] half of them uh land up at our clinics
[2150.72 - 2155.04] and then we start writing a nutrition
[2152.20 - 2157.28] plan on that note I also want to ask you
[2155.04 - 2160.20] uh I was seeing your podcast on protein
[2157.28 - 2162.00] powder does and zahan and I share my son
[2160.20 - 2164.00] and I shared the same protein powder and
[2162.00 - 2165.92] I've been telling him I find it too
[2164.00 - 2168.80] sweet I cannot have it and I've been
[2165.92 - 2170.04] looking for a nons sweeten like a
[2168.80 - 2172.12] natural because I said you know I want
[2170.04 - 2174.12] to get a protein powder and put some
[2172.12 - 2176.24] peanut butter in it to make it tasty but
[2174.12 - 2179.00] I don't want these flavored protein
[2176.24 - 2181.60] powders and just then I read I saw your
[2179.00 - 2184.16] podcast on it and it was everything that
[2181.60 - 2186.16] I was feeling but not being able to
[2184.16 - 2188.48] express because I'm not you know a
[2186.16 - 2191.84] nutritionist and that was really
[2188.48 - 2195.00] interesting so yasman the simplest thing
[2191.84 - 2198.08] that you did was understand your qua qua
[2195.00 - 2200.04] in Latin means incapacity of so you were
[2198.08 - 2202.64] taking this protein powder which is
[2200.04 - 2204.48] commercially designed standardized label
[2202.64 - 2206.44] sweetener flavors and all there's
[2204.48 - 2209.08] nothing wrong with that maybe if you're
[2206.44 - 2211.40] an Olympic level athlete but when you
[2209.08 - 2215.44] are a lifestyle person when you're going
[2211.40 - 2217.68] to take a product day in and day out
[2215.44 - 2219.56] right you want the best nutrition going
[2217.68 - 2222.00] into you do not want the best flavor
[2219.56 - 2224.64] artificial flavor or the artificial
[2222.00 - 2227.08] sweetener entering your body so I'm glad
[2224.64 - 2229.60] you discovered this because this concept
[2227.08 - 2232.16] and every woman should understand this
[2229.60 - 2235.96] there's a bioindividual response in each
[2232.16 - 2237.08] one of us especially in women why women
[2235.96 - 2239.56] because of your
[2237.08 - 2242.56] hormones so that's where you know this
[2239.56 - 2245.92] whole thing starts about wherein if we
[2242.56 - 2249.00] can get women to understand their blood
[2245.92 - 2252.24] biochemistry they hor hormonal chemistry
[2249.00 - 2255.96] their menstration cycle and then what
[2252.24 - 2258.44] life cycle they are at college girl
[2255.96 - 2262.92] first job just
[2258.44 - 2265.88] married trying to get pregnant pregnant
[2262.92 - 2269.04] first second third trimester child is
[2265.88 - 2271.32] born breastfeeding then weight loss post
[2269.04 - 2273.60] pregnancy and then the rest of your life
[2271.32 - 2276.00] in terms of you're having an active
[2273.60 - 2278.64] menstration cycle then and then
[2276.00 - 2280.96] menopause then menopause and then
[2278.64 - 2283.52] postmenopause right so there are all of
[2280.96 - 2286.24] these life cycles with women which are
[2283.52 - 2288.76] highly challenging and Inter relatable
[2286.24 - 2291.96] with your food but if you meet most
[2288.76 - 2293.28] Indian women their diets remain same as
[2291.96 - 2295.64] when it was in
[2293.28 - 2297.60] college so I think that's where
[2295.64 - 2299.72] awareness needs to get to the next level
[2297.60 - 2303.04] and I'm really grateful for trainers
[2299.72 - 2305.92] like you because what happens is in your
[2303.04 - 2308.48] class you get to meet your client every
[2305.92 - 2311.24] day and your ly telling them what are
[2308.48 - 2313.36] you eating what did you eat today so you
[2311.24 - 2315.84] you said you're not a nutritionist but
[2313.36 - 2318.36] you're an honorary nutritionist by just
[2315.84 - 2320.36] asking that question and putting a K in
[2318.36 - 2322.04] your client's head is there's something
[2320.36 - 2324.28] that you need to change about the way
[2322.04 - 2326.92] you eat and that's scientific on that
[2324.28 - 2328.60] note this is what I felt about myself
[2326.92 - 2331.68] because like you said just now very
[2328.60 - 2334.56] truly you eat kind of the same thing
[2331.68 - 2336.36] right so being a fitness instructor and
[2334.56 - 2338.20] I'm very particular about what goes in
[2336.36 - 2340.24] my body I don't eat package Foods I
[2338.20 - 2342.92] don't eat sugar I don't have dairy I
[2340.24 - 2345.24] don't have gluten uh and I'll tell you
[2342.92 - 2349.72] why about that later how I discovered
[2345.24 - 2354.24] that but I eat the same way and suddenly
[2349.72 - 2356.60] after menopause I feel like I cannot eat
[2354.24 - 2358.96] the same way because that eating the
[2356.60 - 2360.80] same way is not working for me and
[2358.96 - 2363.28] because I'm not a nutritionist I don't
[2360.80 - 2367.44] know how I can eat better so just
[2363.28 - 2369.32] recently in fact earlier in in June I
[2367.44 - 2372.80] contacted somebody and said hey you know
[2369.32 - 2375.20] what I need to eat differently and
[2372.80 - 2377.24] everyone said what's wrong with you how
[2375.20 - 2380.84] can you eat better than what you eat and
[2377.24 - 2382.84] I said no my body's needs are different
[2380.84 - 2385.20] and I need to know because I cannot read
[2382.84 - 2388.32] a blood report and I don't know what my
[2385.20 - 2390.32] body requires right and I need that help
[2388.32 - 2394.44] so I've actually contacted somebody who
[2390.32 - 2396.96] I know to get that for me in Bombay and
[2394.44 - 2400.24] I know it's making a difference right
[2396.96 - 2404.28] that's amazing and uh and coming to
[2400.24 - 2406.76] pregnancy I know that you uh counseled
[2404.28 - 2409.32] uh Anushka during her pregnancy please
[2406.76 - 2411.92] tell me a little bit about that and also
[2409.32 - 2413.48] on that note later about verat and
[2411.92 - 2416.12] Shahid being
[2413.48 - 2418.64] vegetarians and how they get their
[2416.12 - 2420.08] protein so basically uh I mean verat
[2418.64 - 2424.36] obviously is one of the best batsmen in
[2420.08 - 2427.60] the world and um he wanted to up his
[2424.36 - 2430.08] game the diet game like he's a brilliant
[2427.60 - 2432.68] eater he's already vegetarian uh he
[2430.08 - 2434.60] already knew how to eat correctly so
[2432.68 - 2437.08] there's a self-interest right because
[2434.60 - 2438.92] you already know that when you eat
[2437.08 - 2440.84] correctly your focus your concentration
[2438.92 - 2442.88] your performance your fat percentage
[2440.84 - 2445.52] your sprinting ability everything is
[2442.88 - 2448.24] tied into the way you train the way you
[2445.52 - 2450.16] sleep and the way you eat uh so
[2448.24 - 2453.76] obviously when verat contacted me this
[2450.16 - 2456.96] was around the pandemic time um they
[2453.76 - 2459.32] were isolated and he wanted to step up
[2456.96 - 2462.48] on his game with nutrition and we worked
[2459.32 - 2465.48] for many months on the diet
[2462.48 - 2467.84] plans there's no rocket science you
[2465.48 - 2469.72] understand a player you understand their
[2467.84 - 2472.12] fat percentage muscle percentage their
[2469.72 - 2473.56] blood biochemistry the genetic test if
[2472.12 - 2476.24] you're lucky you can get a stool
[2473.56 - 2479.52] analysis which is the poop test and read
[2476.24 - 2481.88] the microbiome now once you get that a
[2479.52 - 2484.28] person like me becomes Sherlock Holmes
[2481.88 - 2486.32] we integrate blood test fat percentage
[2484.28 - 2490.36] performance metries and all of those
[2486.32 - 2493.36] things and during this journey um
[2490.36 - 2495.56] obviously verat researches a lot and he
[2493.36 - 2497.48] looked at our website and realized that
[2495.56 - 2500.36] at a quan nutrition clinics I have teams
[2497.48 - 2503.60] of medical dietitians also and they
[2500.36 - 2506.12] happened uh to be expecting their their
[2503.60 - 2508.28] first child and he said can you frame
[2506.12 - 2509.84] the nutrition plan now what people don't
[2508.28 - 2511.16] understand is they think that you just
[2509.84 - 2514.52] have to double
[2511.16 - 2517.44] calories so today women are getting
[2514.52 - 2520.88] wiser because of access to information
[2517.44 - 2523.08] so you can Google up what is a diet for
[2520.88 - 2525.64] conception what is a diet for the first
[2523.08 - 2527.56] trimester when you're puking your guts
[2525.64 - 2531.84] out so
[2527.56 - 2534.96] obviously the people who are astute have
[2531.84 - 2538.84] the means will go and find an expert so
[2534.96 - 2541.08] they ask me can you handle the trimester
[2538.84 - 2544.28] nutrition plan and we did that very
[2541.08 - 2547.88] successfully um and um speaking of
[2544.28 - 2548.96] pregnancy I customize nutrition plants
[2547.88 - 2550.64] uh I was looking at one of your
[2548.96 - 2554.16] Instagram posts where you were with
[2550.64 - 2557.40] earlier but I think so do you also
[2554.16 - 2560.08] really customize your Pilatus workouts
[2557.40 - 2561.24] your fitness workouts for each and every
[2560.08 - 2564.48] client so like nutrition is
[2561.24 - 2566.24] bioindividual is it the same for fitness
[2564.48 - 2567.96] and with Alia what was the journey like
[2566.24 - 2570.08] because you know I get pregnant women
[2567.96 - 2572.36] coming to us for nutrition plan and
[2570.08 - 2574.40] they're like can you give me an exercise
[2572.36 - 2576.24] plan and I'm like I'm not the expert you
[2574.40 - 2577.72] need to contact an expert and they're
[2576.24 - 2579.84] like uh but
[2577.72 - 2581.84] what do we do who should we go to what
[2579.84 - 2584.28] is it done so tell us a little bit more
[2581.84 - 2586.84] about Alia's Jour so definitely like
[2584.28 - 2589.52] nutrition with exercise you have to be
[2586.84 - 2591.76] very very uh to the point for the
[2589.52 - 2594.60] trimester that they are at when they're
[2591.76 - 2596.12] pregnant if they're not we learn and
[2594.60 - 2600.04] that's what I learned with Pilatus and
[2596.12 - 2603.08] that's why for me Pilatus is my Bible we
[2600.04 - 2606.16] train the body in front of us everybody
[2603.08 - 2608.56] has different needs limitations uh
[2606.16 - 2612.48] strengths and and we understand that and
[2608.56 - 2615.08] then we train them with pregnancy I have
[2612.48 - 2618.24] I have an obsession so I'm constantly
[2615.08 - 2620.28] doing more and more training with my
[2618.24 - 2623.28] instructors different experts on
[2620.28 - 2626.20] pregnancy to know more because there is
[2623.28 - 2628.60] so much that you cannot know in one
[2626.20 - 2631.36] training right so I put my instructors
[2628.60 - 2633.36] through with aliot was really funny and
[2631.36 - 2635.84] beautiful because she comes to me and
[2633.36 - 2639.00] she's like yes I'm pregnant but I need
[2635.84 - 2640.44] to exercise so we customized exercises
[2639.00 - 2642.44] and we have to make it interesting
[2640.44 - 2645.08] because now Alia is a person who works
[2642.44 - 2647.64] out every day right and she doesn't want
[2645.08 - 2650.04] to be limited with her body or the
[2647.64 - 2652.24] condition that she is in so we develop
[2650.04 - 2655.20] exercises on the fitball on the Swiss
[2652.24 - 2658.36] ball on the reformer I kept changing it
[2655.20 - 2661.32] because Alia has a very short attention
[2658.36 - 2664.60] span as well so she can if I do like 20
[2661.32 - 2666.60] repetitions I know I've lost her at8 so
[2664.60 - 2668.72] I make it very crisp her workouts are
[2666.60 - 2670.84] very crisp risp you have to move before
[2668.72 - 2672.96] she starts her thoughts go somewhere
[2670.84 - 2674.60] else Oh I thought I only I did that in
[2672.96 - 2676.84] my workouts because I actually switch
[2674.60 - 2678.44] off in my workout and so that's the job
[2676.84 - 2681.08] of the trainer to pull you back in to
[2678.44 - 2683.40] know to know each individual's
[2681.08 - 2686.32] personality ah right there are some
[2683.40 - 2688.32] people who will benefit from repetitions
[2686.32 - 2691.36] because they're not their first four
[2688.32 - 2693.60] reps are not not even counted it takes
[2691.36 - 2695.36] them five repetitions to understand the
[2693.60 - 2697.60] exercise there are some people who
[2695.36 - 2699.16] switch off after eight repetitions
[2697.60 - 2702.08] so you have to change it before their
[2699.16 - 2704.64] mind can switch off so this is actually
[2702.08 - 2707.76] where the personalization happens I just
[2704.64 - 2709.48] understood it that a trainer can have
[2707.76 - 2712.48] all the knowledge about the dumbbell the
[2709.48 - 2714.84] reformer bed Zumba boomba whatever it is
[2712.48 - 2716.52] and they can be like great with Anatomy
[2714.84 - 2718.00] but if they don't understand the
[2716.52 - 2719.88] personality of the client then there's
[2718.00 - 2723.64] something missing but I think this is
[2719.88 - 2726.20] also because of the like I said I love
[2723.64 - 2728.92] doing uh training courses right I love
[2726.20 - 2731.48] learning more and every time I learn I
[2728.92 - 2734.64] learn something new like I remember the
[2731.48 - 2736.88] first Pilatus um training I did I had
[2734.64 - 2738.92] met other instructors it was their
[2736.88 - 2741.12] second or third training from a
[2738.92 - 2743.08] different school and the Pilatus
[2741.12 - 2745.12] training is one of the toughest
[2743.08 - 2747.68] trainings I've done I've done a diet
[2745.12 - 2750.24] plans for few of the Pilatus students
[2747.68 - 2752.04] who go for these and you know the timing
[2750.24 - 2754.28] of what has been given to your guys in
[2752.04 - 2757.56] terms of practice and study and
[2754.28 - 2759.84] Performing is brutal and intense it both
[2757.56 - 2762.20] on the mind and the muscle yeah so I
[2759.84 - 2764.20] would meet these people who had done
[2762.20 - 2766.40] that they were on the third uh
[2764.20 - 2769.44] instruction course I be like why would
[2766.40 - 2772.56] you do this again like this first one
[2769.44 - 2775.04] but now after having been certified by
[2772.56 - 2777.12] three different schools of Pilatus I
[2775.04 - 2779.88] understand the why it's because you
[2777.12 - 2781.84] learn something completely different
[2779.88 - 2784.64] from every school of Pilatus and now
[2781.84 - 2787.56] that I'm writing my own Pilatus manuals
[2784.64 - 2790.36] I'm using all three schools to make
[2787.56 - 2792.44] something which is unique do you feel
[2790.36 - 2793.88] your 30 years of experience is enough or
[2792.44 - 2795.52] would you like to go back in time and
[2793.88 - 2798.56] ask for more
[2795.52 - 2801.84] experience my 30 years of experience is
[2798.56 - 2804.24] not ended it's still ongoing so no so
[2801.84 - 2808.24] you're saying that even as a teacher you
[2804.24 - 2810.68] have to keep learning I I love to learn
[2808.24 - 2812.84] there's so much that I still don't know
[2810.68 - 2814.40] and when you're learning or practicing
[2812.84 - 2817.00] or
[2814.40 - 2820.44] teaching do you get ideas for your
[2817.00 - 2822.80] pupils or students on the spot of course
[2820.44 - 2825.48] I would be doing one machine and then
[2822.80 - 2827.88] suddenly I'm like like sometimes when
[2825.48 - 2831.08] I'm making them do an exercise I feel
[2827.88 - 2834.76] like it's not working like something's
[2831.08 - 2837.64] not working and I need to switch it it
[2834.76 - 2840.52] could be a well researched exercise that
[2837.64 - 2843.92] I do day in and day out but at that
[2840.52 - 2845.56] point that body is not reacting to me
[2843.92 - 2847.32] and that's what makes me change it like
[2845.56 - 2850.12] say I was training you and I was making
[2847.32 - 2852.80] you do feet and straps which is an
[2850.12 - 2855.84] exercise you do beautifully and you've
[2852.80 - 2858.04] done it for maybe the last 10 sessions
[2855.84 - 2860.72] but on that particular day maybe because
[2858.04 - 2862.96] you've not slept well maybe because you
[2860.72 - 2865.68] just come back from a trip your body is
[2862.96 - 2867.64] not reacting to it for various you're
[2865.68 - 2870.88] you're feeling a bit under the weather
[2867.64 - 2873.12] I'm seeing how your body is moving and I
[2870.88 - 2875.48] know that okay this exercise today is
[2873.12 - 2879.20] not working for you and I have to change
[2875.48 - 2882.44] it so 30 years plus of experience Family
[2879.20 - 2885.64] Support they're your backbone were your
[2882.44 - 2888.32] parents instrumental in your fitness
[2885.64 - 2890.92] journey uh and do they walk the walk and
[2888.32 - 2893.96] talk the talk or this was self-inspired
[2890.92 - 2896.12] my parents influence me
[2893.96 - 2898.52] subconsciously because my dad we used to
[2896.12 - 2901.12] live at Ali in Bombay which is
[2898.52 - 2904.28] close to the race course and my dad was
[2901.12 - 2905.92] an avid Walker in the race course and
[2904.28 - 2908.36] sometimes he would try like I said I was
[2905.92 - 2910.28] a lazy kid so would try to take me and I
[2908.36 - 2912.00] had to run to keep up to his walking
[2910.28 - 2915.00] because he was such a fast Walker and I
[2912.00 - 2917.64] hated it so my dad every day Come Rain
[2915.00 - 2919.68] shine whatever even in the rain even in
[2917.64 - 2922.48] the rain he would be at the Mahal lakmi
[2919.68 - 2926.88] race course uh walking two rounds which
[2922.48 - 2930.76] is like some 7 8 km uh and then as he
[2926.88 - 2933.72] Grew Older he would walk 10 km my mom
[2930.76 - 2935.36] used to do yoga we lived in haeli and in
[2933.72 - 2937.64] those days we had one car so Dad would
[2935.36 - 2942.08] take the car to office mom would take a
[2937.64 - 2944.64] bus and go to uh Cho party and do yoga
[2942.08 - 2946.92] there and I thought my parents were
[2944.64 - 2948.52] crazy like I couldn't understand why
[2946.92 - 2950.64] they were making such a big deal about
[2948.52 - 2953.20] exercising they both look pretty good
[2950.64 - 2955.96] but I think that kind of discipline is
[2953.20 - 2958.60] what came down the jeans which was a
[2955.96 - 2961.00] great thing because now I understand
[2958.60 - 2963.76] that I get it from them subconsciously
[2961.00 - 2965.84] they were my role models and uh they
[2963.76 - 2969.08] always told me do something my mom would
[2965.84 - 2971.56] constantly while I was growing up say do
[2969.08 - 2974.08] something move exercise go down and play
[2971.56 - 2975.16] go down and play so yeah speaking of our
[2974.08 - 2978.20] beloved
[2975.16 - 2980.24] mothers I constantly try and tell my mom
[2978.20 - 2982.20] mom I bought her a set of dumbbells
[2980.24 - 2986.60] recently and Mom you've got to strength
[2982.20 - 2989.44] train your advice to all the mothers out
[2986.60 - 2991.68] there especially the mothers our mothers
[2989.44 - 2994.16] who are of the older generation they
[2991.68 - 2997.20] don't work out what is yasmin's advice
[2994.16 - 2999.68] to all the moms out there
[2997.20 - 3001.08] that every decade like you know and I'm
[2999.68 - 3003.92] sure you're telling your mom we lose
[3001.08 - 3006.44] bone density the only thing that prot
[3003.92 - 3008.80] protects us is our muscle and you need
[3006.44 - 3011.80] to do some sort of exercise and
[3008.80 - 3016.48] especially in today's generation and age
[3011.80 - 3018.44] where we have uh uh sedentary Lifestyles
[3016.48 - 3020.68] where we're not moving like our mother's
[3018.44 - 3022.44] mothers did a lot of work they used to
[3020.68 - 3024.96] do housework they would go to the well
[3022.44 - 3027.00] to get water they would milk the cows I
[3024.96 - 3030.96] remember the grinding stone that might
[3027.00 - 3033.48] used to go on 45 minutes Chuy you know
[3030.96 - 3036.40] so our mother's mothers did a lot of
[3033.48 - 3038.56] work like physical work our mothers
[3036.40 - 3040.80] don't because of course the the luxuries
[3038.56 - 3044.36] have come in in our generation and
[3040.80 - 3048.04] there's much later they need to move my
[3044.36 - 3050.20] mom is 76 my mother-in-law is 82 and
[3048.04 - 3054.16] they both do Pilatus they need to find a
[3050.20 - 3058.36] very you know yoga we we are the we are
[3054.16 - 3061.72] the um what's the word p p not the the
[3058.36 - 3063.92] birth place of yoga births it in India
[3061.72 - 3065.96] right and yoga is something that all our
[3063.92 - 3067.92] mothers can do and if you have the
[3065.96 - 3070.60] opportunity you can do Pilatus which is
[3067.92 - 3073.56] so gentle on your bones and my mother at
[3070.60 - 3076.36] 76 my mother-in-law at 82 do Pilatus and
[3073.56 - 3079.20] they look fabulous and they feel really
[3076.36 - 3080.88] good they're energetic they're moving
[3079.20 - 3084.12] around and also I don't know if you know
[3080.88 - 3087.20] Helen Khan mhm she started Pilatus at
[3084.12 - 3090.64] the age of 85 85
[3087.20 - 3093.76] 5 so what is the core component for all
[3090.64 - 3095.92] the ladies watching in about Pilatus
[3093.76 - 3098.44] what is the core component or how do
[3095.92 - 3099.84] they understand so why do you have diets
[3098.44 - 3102.40] for people right why do you have
[3099.84 - 3105.04] nutrition plans to nourish the body
[3102.40 - 3106.16] patus nourishes your body in terms of
[3105.04 - 3110.64] physical
[3106.16 - 3114.28] activity okay and so between yoga and
[3110.64 - 3116.56] Pilatus I know this is a loaded question
[3114.28 - 3119.20] and a lady came to you I'm this old lady
[3116.56 - 3122.00] and I was like Yasmin what exercise
[3119.20 - 3123.80] should I do I can only do yoga or I have
[3122.00 - 3125.60] time only for Pilatus only one of them
[3123.80 - 3128.40] which one should I do I would tell them
[3125.60 - 3131.48] why don't you do both see which one you
[3128.40 - 3134.68] love to do and stick to that that's sely
[3131.48 - 3137.72] advice because it's about if you love it
[3134.68 - 3139.48] you you you'll turn up more often and
[3137.72 - 3142.16] then you make it a lifestyle because you
[3139.48 - 3145.32] have to look forward to exercising also
[3142.16 - 3147.08] it can't be a burden and a chore so
[3145.32 - 3149.48] maybe instead of giving you mom
[3147.08 - 3151.96] dumbbells if you take her to a yoga
[3149.48 - 3153.60] class or get somebody home to do yoga or
[3151.96 - 3156.52] a little bit of movement or just some
[3153.60 - 3159.12] theraband exercises she might enjoy that
[3156.52 - 3161.28] more mom if you're listening in I'm
[3159.12 - 3162.80] calling up the the best yoga instructor
[3161.28 - 3165.44] in go and getting a class for you so
[3162.80 - 3169.12] don't Grumble Madame Yas you have to try
[3165.44 - 3170.96] yoga Pilatus uh just some freestyle like
[3169.12 - 3173.44] calisthenics you have to try different
[3170.96 - 3175.80] things to see which one she
[3173.44 - 3178.08] enjoys but most of the old people hit
[3175.80 - 3179.76] back to saying oh we're too old now this
[3178.08 - 3181.00] is not meant for us if we had to do it
[3179.76 - 3183.56] we should have done it in our younger
[3181.00 - 3184.36] years you're never too old to take care
[3183.56 - 3186.56] of
[3184.36 - 3188.92] yourself what are the common mistakes
[3186.56 - 3190.80] that people make when starting a fitness
[3188.92 - 3193.40] journey that you have seen doing
[3190.80 - 3196.72] something because it's set to be good
[3193.40 - 3199.56] for you not finding out what you enjoy
[3196.72 - 3201.16] to do and what's really good for you but
[3199.56 - 3203.64] you're telling people do p artist do
[3201.16 - 3204.96] yoga so then they turn up for it but
[3203.64 - 3207.84] what are the what are the things that
[3204.96 - 3209.84] they could expect that could
[3207.84 - 3212.24] that could discourage them to do too
[3209.84 - 3215.00] much too fast like people watch the
[3212.24 - 3217.92] internet now and Instagram like they're
[3215.00 - 3219.32] seeing people doing these fancy Pilatus
[3217.92 - 3221.84] moves and they come to class and they
[3219.32 - 3225.00] show the instructor and they
[3221.84 - 3227.16] say but is your body ready for it is
[3225.00 - 3230.00] your foundation strong enough like I
[3227.16 - 3232.80] said Matt patus is foundation do you
[3230.00 - 3234.92] have the foundation to do that exercise
[3232.80 - 3237.76] that's what's important don't see
[3234.92 - 3239.76] exercises on the in internet because
[3237.76 - 3241.92] people have mastered that and then
[3239.76 - 3244.28] they're showing it off you know I have a
[3241.92 - 3245.84] confession over here I do karate I've
[3244.28 - 3248.16] been doing it for many many years and I
[3245.84 - 3250.72] started a new style and I found one of
[3248.16 - 3254.24] India's best martial instru martial arts
[3250.72 - 3256.12] instructor he handles the Indian team
[3254.24 - 3259.64] and I wanted to do something known as a
[3256.12 - 3262.80] Kata which is a pre-form style or dance
[3259.64 - 3265.80] and he's like that is for a black belt
[3262.80 - 3268.04] you are only an orange belt uh you
[3265.80 - 3270.96] cannot learn that right now and it
[3268.04 - 3274.12] struck me at that moment if weight
[3270.96 - 3276.68] training Fitness Yoga Pilates had
[3274.12 - 3279.16] colored gradiation belts in it we could
[3276.68 - 3281.64] take people on a journey slow and steady
[3279.16 - 3285.00] where they knew they had to earn the
[3281.64 - 3286.88] next belt but speaking uh speaking of
[3285.00 - 3288.92] earning their belts we've got the
[3286.88 - 3292.72] celebrity superstars who are black belts
[3288.92 - 3293.84] in their life you've got uh deika paron
[3292.72 - 3297.48] Katrina
[3293.84 - 3299.52] C how does their worker out differ from
[3297.48 - 3302.36] a normal person's workout or is it the
[3299.52 - 3305.32] same it's the same it's just that their
[3302.36 - 3307.52] needs are different like how like if
[3305.32 - 3310.96] like when Katrina had to do chickney
[3307.52 - 3313.64] cham the dance and she was doing this
[3310.96 - 3316.04] vigorous Dance Movement where her no fat
[3313.64 - 3319.04] could jiggle and she said yes if
[3316.04 - 3321.52] anything Jiggles I'll go on national TV
[3319.04 - 3323.40] and say you're not a good instructor wow
[3321.52 - 3326.00] so then the workout gets customized to
[3323.40 - 3328.56] make sure that because people also troll
[3326.00 - 3331.76] you for silly things not realizing I got
[3328.56 - 3333.52] trolled yesterday uh with a picture I
[3331.76 - 3336.52] with some video I put up and they were
[3333.52 - 3338.28] like oh you also have a stomach how can
[3336.52 - 3341.24] you be a Pilatus how can you be an
[3338.28 - 3343.40] instructor I was like everyone has it's
[3341.24 - 3344.80] like my hair stylist is bald and I still
[3343.40 - 3347.28] go to him because he's the best in the
[3344.80 - 3349.48] world right so and we all have bodies
[3347.28 - 3352.92] and I just want to say that what you see
[3349.48 - 3354.80] on Instagram is not reality most of the
[3352.92 - 3356.68] time we put our best foot forward
[3354.80 - 3358.24] obviously we want to look good we don't
[3356.68 - 3361.04] want to show and why would you put up
[3358.24 - 3364.12] your BST foot on a social media platform
[3361.04 - 3366.56] right but to troll is just something
[3364.12 - 3369.60] which we've learned to do without
[3366.56 - 3372.36] thinking of consequences so when an
[3369.60 - 3375.56] actor goes on on on on a film set and
[3372.36 - 3377.76] has to look a particular way they work
[3375.56 - 3381.12] really really hard and we customize
[3377.76 - 3383.28] everything for them to look that way for
[3381.12 - 3385.44] the people who Envy the our film stars
[3383.28 - 3388.68] who come to us they don't see the
[3385.44 - 3392.12] background what's an average number of
[3388.68 - 3395.80] minutes that a person puts in every day
[3392.12 - 3398.72] for their Fitness regime I would say an
[3395.80 - 3402.00] actor or a superstar whether it's an
[3398.72 - 3404.20] athlete or an actor they put in 24 hours
[3402.00 - 3406.12] into their day to give you what what
[3404.20 - 3407.72] you're getting right because it's not
[3406.12 - 3408.96] just their workout it's their workout
[3407.72 - 3411.76] it's their lifestyle it's their
[3408.96 - 3414.44] nutrition it all needs to go hand and
[3411.76 - 3416.68] glove just one thing on its own will
[3414.44 - 3418.68] collapse it's like all these pillars
[3416.68 - 3422.24] have to be strong for them to be on the
[3418.68 - 3423.88] top so they what what you don't see is
[3422.24 - 3426.60] the kind of work they put in they've had
[3423.88 - 3429.56] a 14 hour shift where they're shooting
[3426.60 - 3431.28] and they still come to workout you know
[3429.56 - 3433.44] after that shift you have to customize
[3431.28 - 3435.68] their workout according to what kind of
[3433.44 - 3437.24] a day they've had they are on set the
[3435.68 - 3439.80] whole day how are they managing their
[3437.24 - 3442.44] nutrition which you know it's it's not
[3439.80 - 3444.80] easy right but they do it because that's
[3442.44 - 3447.00] the investment that they've made in in
[3444.80 - 3448.52] themselves so that those are the things
[3447.00 - 3451.24] you don't see what you see is them on
[3448.52 - 3453.48] screen looking their glamorous self or
[3451.24 - 3455.68] you're trying to catch them outside a a
[3453.48 - 3457.40] beauty P or the airport and you know
[3455.68 - 3459.68] things like that even that has become
[3457.40 - 3462.32] stressful for them now and that was a
[3459.68 - 3464.48] that was a famous role and for her to
[3462.32 - 3468.12] have no fat jiggling anywhere was a
[3464.48 - 3469.92] testament to your ability to train her
[3468.12 - 3472.80] can you share some secrets about that
[3469.92 - 3476.56] work out that were really brutally
[3472.80 - 3478.68] Intense or was it a cakewalk for her no
[3476.56 - 3480.20] no it wasn't a cak work for sure I'm
[3478.68 - 3483.08] just trying to recollect because it was
[3480.20 - 3486.80] so many years back but it was very we
[3483.08 - 3488.96] used to work out every day um an hour of
[3486.80 - 3492.92] workout we used to put in cardio after
[3488.96 - 3494.76] that the food was very disciplined uh we
[3492.92 - 3496.96] never did the same workout every day we
[3494.76 - 3498.84] were doing a lot of functional training
[3496.96 - 3501.92] which needed to change every day because
[3498.84 - 3503.92] Katrina gets bored really easily also so
[3501.92 - 3505.88] we I never do the same workout every day
[3503.92 - 3509.28] with my clients so I had to come up with
[3505.88 - 3512.00] new new ways to do the same thing you
[3509.28 - 3515.28] know if you know what I mean and also it
[3512.00 - 3518.00] was making sure that if she was shooting
[3515.28 - 3520.84] how do I put in those hours of training
[3518.00 - 3523.92] with her without it hampering her
[3520.84 - 3525.60] performance at work uh on days when she
[3523.92 - 3528.16] would have had a long shoot we would
[3525.60 - 3530.40] just do patus but it would be active
[3528.16 - 3532.88] patus but if she while she was shooting
[3530.40 - 3536.24] the song we would do passive Pilatus so
[3532.88 - 3538.00] it was more about rebalancing herself so
[3536.24 - 3539.96] you were taking the calorie balance like
[3538.00 - 3541.92] the expenditure was aggressive at a
[3539.96 - 3544.00] movie set then she came back and
[3541.92 - 3546.04] rejuvenated her training with you and if
[3544.00 - 3549.16] it was a day off you would go into
[3546.04 - 3551.76] intense hardcore workouts I would love
[3549.16 - 3554.32] to be um a circuit inside your brain
[3551.76 - 3556.24] right now uh because you customize and
[3554.32 - 3557.48] design these workouts like a like a
[3556.24 - 3559.76] computer right you've got all of the
[3557.48 - 3561.92] experience and it's a code exactly like
[3559.76 - 3564.72] you what didn't you say Ryan yeah so it
[3561.92 - 3566.72] is it is what we do but it would be very
[3564.72 - 3568.44] interesting to pick notes with somebody
[3566.72 - 3570.84] on how they do it because sometimes I'm
[3568.44 - 3573.24] just thinking okay Shahid kapor gets up
[3570.84 - 3576.36] at 4:30 in the morning and then starts
[3573.24 - 3578.36] his workout Come Rain or sunshine and
[3576.36 - 3580.64] you see that discipline in people who
[3578.36 - 3582.76] are very very driven and then he's
[3580.64 - 3585.20] finished his meditation his prayer his
[3582.76 - 3587.68] workout everything before his kids get
[3585.20 - 3589.20] up and then he dresses them up to school
[3587.68 - 3592.76] and stuff like that
[3589.20 - 3595.24] so when you look at how you have to
[3592.76 - 3596.84] manage that uh you have to write down
[3595.24 - 3600.24] your notes and put things together so
[3596.84 - 3602.80] it's a lot of manual practice creating a
[3600.24 - 3606.76] diet plan or an exercise plan now in
[3602.80 - 3609.48] today's world AI is com in so I've been
[3606.76 - 3612.24] seeing that AI has been begun to help me
[3609.48 - 3615.64] research dishes that I never knew about
[3612.24 - 3617.76] right has AI changed your mindset what
[3615.64 - 3621.00] do you feel about it providing
[3617.76 - 3624.36] customized workouts to people and look
[3621.00 - 3626.76] you and I are Craftsmen of our
[3624.36 - 3629.44] trade and a lot of people are saying but
[3626.76 - 3631.44] I can now get an AI diet plan and AI
[3629.44 - 3634.16] exercise plan where are you in this
[3631.44 - 3636.48] world right now so at like I said
[3634.16 - 3639.32] earlier Ryan I'm constantly learning and
[3636.48 - 3641.00] I'm always eager to learn and at 54
[3639.32 - 3644.16] today what I've learned from you is how
[3641.00 - 3646.24] to use AI so I'm going to now start
[3644.16 - 3649.44] exploring the world of AI which I
[3646.24 - 3652.20] haven't yet because I didn't know how to
[3649.44 - 3654.56] uh but yeah I mean it sounds what
[3652.20 - 3657.96] whatever you've shown me today before we
[3654.56 - 3661.08] started this podcast has really uh got
[3657.96 - 3663.36] my mind ticking as to how I can now work
[3661.08 - 3666.20] even more efficiently I think that's a
[3663.36 - 3667.76] key word work more efficiently because
[3666.20 - 3670.44] uh somebody asked me this question the
[3667.76 - 3673.52] other days that you think uh you know I
[3670.44 - 3676.32] can just get an AI driven diet chart but
[3673.52 - 3680.16] I think the motivational part of your
[3676.32 - 3681.76] instructor teacher Guru uh nutritionist
[3680.16 - 3686.04] or fitness instructor whoever that
[3681.76 - 3688.44] person is the presence of a person the
[3686.04 - 3690.48] guidance by that person the motivation
[3688.44 - 3692.08] by that person I think it'll be quite a
[3690.48 - 3694.08] few number of years before AI can
[3692.08 - 3696.96] actually take over that part of our
[3694.08 - 3699.32] Lives it's also like I said earlier you
[3696.96 - 3701.24] you sense the energy that the person is
[3699.32 - 3703.88] giving you right sometimes you don't
[3701.24 - 3706.04] know the energy that you're giving out
[3703.88 - 3707.96] but your instructor can feel that energy
[3706.04 - 3710.00] and then modifies the workout according
[3707.96 - 3713.76] to that you literally have to have a
[3710.00 - 3716.48] robot AI present uh with sensitivities
[3713.76 - 3719.40] to feel that for you
[3716.48 - 3720.92] and you as a trainer I've seen some of
[3719.40 - 3723.00] your videos you talk highly about
[3720.92 - 3724.68] nutrition you're one of the few trainers
[3723.00 - 3727.36] that I've looked at and you've said
[3724.68 - 3730.64] nutrition is of primary importance you
[3727.36 - 3733.36] can't uh you know you can't outtrain a
[3730.64 - 3735.96] bad diet so what are some of the
[3733.36 - 3737.96] nutrition tips that you guide your
[3735.96 - 3739.72] celebrity clients with what are the
[3737.96 - 3742.64] basics that you give over there one
[3739.72 - 3745.40] thing I like to tell everyone is to not
[3742.64 - 3748.24] have sugar refined sugar because I've
[3745.40 - 3750.16] learned this this uh my dad had my dad
[3748.24 - 3753.36] was discovered with cancer about 11
[3750.16 - 3756.96] years back and we took him to Mexico to
[3753.36 - 3759.00] this health uh Hospital uh Oasis of Good
[3756.96 - 3760.84] Hope because we didn't want to do chemo
[3759.00 - 3763.32] with him he was stage three lung cancer
[3760.84 - 3765.44] and we wanted to change and get him
[3763.32 - 3767.16] better up and they promised that through
[3765.44 - 3769.44] nutrition they would change your
[3767.16 - 3771.20] lifestyle and give you a good quality of
[3769.44 - 3773.72] life they don't tell you we'll take your
[3771.20 - 3775.48] cancer away but the life that you have
[3773.72 - 3777.36] left they promise you will be good
[3775.48 - 3779.40] quality and that's what happened with
[3777.36 - 3782.64] him and the doctor there said
[3779.40 - 3784.96] that sugar is poisoned to your body and
[3782.64 - 3787.28] when you go for a pet scan they put in
[3784.96 - 3790.00] an injection and that's glucose which
[3787.28 - 3791.84] tells your cancer cells it's time to
[3790.00 - 3794.64] party and they light up so that you can
[3791.84 - 3796.44] capture that image on the machine and
[3794.64 - 3798.88] that's the one thing that stuck in my
[3796.44 - 3801.28] head my dad lived for about 18 months
[3798.88 - 3805.16] after that it was good quality of life
[3801.28 - 3807.76] but uh he didn't go out you know with
[3805.16 - 3810.60] pain and you know he he accepted that I
[3807.76 - 3813.44] have that much time left he was so
[3810.60 - 3815.88] that's the one thing for me which is
[3813.44 - 3818.32] poison which is sugar and that's what I
[3815.88 - 3820.20] tell my clients and the next thing is
[3818.32 - 3822.64] eat foods that are
[3820.20 - 3824.76] alive because you're going to feel alive
[3822.64 - 3827.56] right so your fruits your
[3824.76 - 3829.84] vegetables uh you eat a package food
[3827.56 - 3832.88] which has preservative it's dead it's
[3829.84 - 3835.28] going to make you feel dead you who can
[3832.88 - 3839.04] say they had a a packet of Doritos or
[3835.28 - 3842.52] potato ships and felt
[3839.04 - 3845.92] great before we wrap up one piece of
[3842.52 - 3847.72] advice you would give to my audience out
[3845.92 - 3851.16] there if they were going to start on
[3847.72 - 3854.44] their fitness journey take baby
[3851.16 - 3857.64] steps find out what exercise works for
[3854.44 - 3860.80] your body what exercise you enjoy build
[3857.64 - 3862.96] a really strong foundation and then take
[3860.80 - 3865.76] it upwards when you say baby steps are
[3862.96 - 3868.80] you meaning uh the intensity of that
[3865.76 - 3870.76] that one day workout or planning it for
[3868.80 - 3872.72] the whole year and go SL and steady for
[3870.76 - 3874.72] the whole year no I mean if you're a
[3872.72 - 3877.48] person who's never exercised and you're
[3874.72 - 3879.36] starting off on a journey don't suddenly
[3877.48 - 3882.60] say okay now I'm going to exercise four
[3879.36 - 3885.76] times a week an hour say I'll exercise
[3882.60 - 3888.20] twice a week for half an hour get used
[3885.76 - 3890.24] to it get that into your routine build
[3888.20 - 3892.64] on that once you start enjoying it once
[3890.24 - 3895.24] you start seeing results then take a
[3892.64 - 3897.40] little more then and we we we're both
[3895.24 - 3900.52] available on the internet if you don't
[3897.40 - 3902.92] have money find us you know follow the
[3900.52 - 3906.60] right in exercise routine don't try to
[3902.92 - 3908.84] suddenly from zero try to go to 50 and
[3906.60 - 3912.08] say okay now I'll start with squats
[3908.84 - 3915.32] lunges leg presses deadlifts you know
[3912.08 - 3916.84] build get your body ready for it so
[3915.32 - 3918.56] that's pretty much what I'd like to say
[3916.84 - 3921.36] to people who want to start out that
[3918.56 - 3924.96] plan it takes take baby steps right but
[3921.36 - 3926.72] one for you now Ryan uh supplements
[3924.96 - 3929.12] people say oh I don't take any
[3926.72 - 3931.28] supplements I recently have discovered
[3929.12 - 3933.80] the importance of supplements can you
[3931.28 - 3935.88] share your thoughts on that so
[3933.80 - 3937.48] supplements I always say this are a
[3935.88 - 3939.88] nutritional convenience for your
[3937.48 - 3943.20] nutritional indiscipline now your
[3939.88 - 3945.16] indiscipline could be genuine that is
[3943.20 - 3947.88] your body stops absorbing because you're
[3945.16 - 3950.32] aging or you have a genetic back foot to
[3947.88 - 3952.44] not absorb that like I have a Calcium
[3950.32 - 3953.96] deficiency absorption Gene so my body
[3952.44 - 3956.56] doesn't absorb calcium mil so I need to
[3953.96 - 3958.36] take a supplement and on the other hand
[3956.56 - 3960.88] the indiscipline could be because you do
[3958.36 - 3963.64] not know how to eat correctly or you're
[3960.88 - 3965.72] abusing your body so supplements are
[3963.64 - 3968.16] good provided they're taken under
[3965.72 - 3970.92] medical advice in conjunction with a
[3968.16 - 3974.36] genetic test and a blood test to know
[3970.92 - 3977.68] where you lie taking excess amount of
[3974.36 - 3980.08] any micronutrient be it a plant compound
[3977.68 - 3981.92] vitamin or mineral research is shown
[3980.08 - 3984.12] that sometimes it can activate centers
[3981.92 - 3986.12] of growth including cancer so you might
[3984.12 - 3988.72] be aiming for muscle growth beautiful
[3986.12 - 3991.36] skin growth but could you also activate
[3988.72 - 3993.40] uh anomalies inside of your body so this
[3991.36 - 3995.68] whole concept today where startups have
[3993.40 - 3997.96] come and left right and Center people
[3995.68 - 4000.60] have supplement companies and people are
[3997.96 - 4002.96] prescribing supplements and with due
[4000.60 - 4005.84] respect to anybody who's influencing or
[4002.96 - 4009.56] advertising supplements out there you
[4005.84 - 4011.80] are not qualified to understand how that
[4009.56 - 4014.84] supplement would interact in your
[4011.80 - 4017.76] client's body in fact doctors do not
[4014.84 - 4022.56] study about nutrition in Medical College
[4017.76 - 4025.92] and therefore their training on drugs is
[4022.56 - 4028.44] Paramount in medicine but it's not
[4025.92 - 4031.32] nutriceutical and therefore their idea
[4028.44 - 4034.28] of vitamins minerals amino acids is
[4031.32 - 4036.08] trained in later years by the
[4034.28 - 4038.32] pharmaceutical industry who approaches
[4036.08 - 4040.04] them for the general range of Nutri
[4038.32 - 4041.68] nutriceuticals multivitamins which is
[4040.04 - 4044.12] why you see doctors saying okay you can
[4041.68 - 4046.72] take this product of nutrical origin but
[4044.12 - 4048.24] only for two or three weeks then stop
[4046.72 - 4050.36] but what if there's a condition that
[4048.24 - 4053.52] requires you to take a nutriceutical
[4050.36 - 4055.48] supplement lifelong you only come to
[4053.52 - 4057.92] know this with repeated blood
[4055.48 - 4060.68] biochemistry tests working with a
[4057.92 - 4062.72] qualified medical dietician or medical
[4060.68 - 4065.32] nutritionist and they're tracking you
[4062.72 - 4068.96] over a period of time and not giving you
[4065.32 - 4071.16] Mega doses of supplementation a lot of
[4068.96 - 4073.24] nutritional companies like in protein
[4071.16 - 4075.68] powders they say you need to take 2 G
[4073.24 - 4078.00] per kg body weight but not everyone a
[4075.68 - 4080.56] bodybuilder so why would you take 2 G
[4078.00 - 4082.60] per kg body weight every day but if
[4080.56 - 4085.12] you're taking only 30 g of protein a day
[4082.60 - 4087.20] in your entire diet and you need 70 G
[4085.12 - 4091.48] then you need a supplement so it's kind
[4087.20 - 4093.56] of uh when you drive a car the road is
[4091.48 - 4095.08] open you'll press the accelerator but
[4093.56 - 4097.32] when there's traffic you're not pressing
[4095.08 - 4099.24] the accelerator so you need to
[4097.32 - 4101.72] understand or determine the conditions
[4099.24 - 4105.52] inside your body and this I advise
[4101.72 - 4108.00] people to seek professional medical help
[4105.52 - 4109.48] before they start supplementation and a
[4108.00 - 4112.00] lot of people now are supplementing
[4109.48 - 4114.72] because of longevity things like
[4112.00 - 4118.52] resveratol nadh
[4114.72 - 4119.56] nmn um you know um aanin one of my
[4118.52 - 4122.92] favorite
[4119.56 - 4124.64] molecules but when you're kind of it's
[4122.92 - 4126.68] like you know imagine people everyone
[4124.64 - 4128.92] says I know how to cook then you go to
[4126.68 - 4131.84] the kitchen and you put this Masala that
[4128.92 - 4133.96] Masala because all masalas are good
[4131.84 - 4135.44] right you're not even tasting a dish so
[4133.96 - 4136.84] you're not even doing the blood test
[4135.44 - 4138.84] you're just putting masalas inside of
[4136.84 - 4140.72] your body Masala meaning
[4138.84 - 4143.32] supplements the dish is going to turn
[4140.72 - 4146.16] out not so good at some point of time
[4143.32 - 4149.24] gastritis uh you know uh digestive
[4146.16 - 4151.68] disorders High BP I've had a client once
[4149.24 - 4153.64] who began taking a fat burner simple fat
[4151.68 - 4156.36] burner called el cartine but did not
[4153.64 - 4158.80] know it had an interaction with the
[4156.36 - 4159.96] thyroid and the day they turned up in my
[4158.80 - 4161.52] clinic they showed the data and
[4159.96 - 4162.96] everything I looked at it and I says
[4161.52 - 4164.52] you're taking a nutritional supplement
[4162.96 - 4165.84] that you're not supposed to take it's
[4164.52 - 4167.20] like how do you know we didn't tell it
[4165.84 - 4171.08] to you it's like it's clearly indicated
[4167.20 - 4173.12] in your blood test so Sherlock Holmes is
[4171.08 - 4174.80] there in your blood test so don't take a
[4173.12 - 4177.84] nutritional supplement without having
[4174.80 - 4180.84] data on hand on ELC cartin I quickly
[4177.84 - 4183.28] want to ask you what is your take on
[4180.84 - 4187.00] wjar and
[4183.28 - 4190.24] OIC these drugs are designed by the
[4187.00 - 4194.96] pharmaceutical industry to help medical
[4190.24 - 4196.32] patients who are at the last mile of
[4194.96 - 4198.88] literally
[4196.32 - 4201.40] hopelessness and this is a savior for
[4198.88 - 4203.48] them now when you produce something you
[4201.40 - 4205.84] got to find a market for it so you go to
[4203.48 - 4208.04] all the fat people on the planet and say
[4205.84 - 4209.72] you know what we know you can't work out
[4208.04 - 4211.52] you know what we know you can't follow
[4209.72 - 4213.92] Ryan Fernando's diet you know what
[4211.52 - 4214.72] you're a failure so you know what take
[4213.92 - 4217.88] this
[4214.72 - 4220.68] drug I've been through about four cycles
[4217.88 - 4223.12] of marketing of different drugs as a
[4220.68 - 4224.92] student uh as working for supplement
[4223.12 - 4226.44] companies and then starting my own
[4224.92 - 4229.44] business
[4226.44 - 4232.32] and what I observe is that these are
[4229.44 - 4234.32] fads that last till you get sufficient
[4232.32 - 4236.72] clinical data coming out by the real
[4234.32 - 4238.96] life population saying there are amazing
[4236.72 - 4241.40] side effects and when I say amazing
[4238.96 - 4244.00] amazing meaning Tupper as I say in my
[4241.40 - 4245.40] Instagram people are are are are getting
[4244.00 - 4248.40] side effects that are taking them to
[4245.40 - 4249.80] hospital so I'm not a huge fan of any of
[4248.40 - 4251.72] these products because they are not
[4249.80 - 4254.56] found in nature but if you tell me
[4251.72 - 4255.88] dalini cinnamon eltin which is found in
[4254.56 - 4257.52] the human body
[4255.88 - 4259.76] vitamin B complex which is found in the
[4257.52 - 4262.04] human body I'm a little bit okay about
[4259.76 - 4264.48] giving a little extra of this because
[4262.04 - 4266.00] the side effect you will see it in your
[4264.48 - 4268.16] body and it's
[4266.00 - 4270.52] reversible what is the side effect
[4268.16 - 4272.52] hyperactivity little acidity so like
[4270.52 - 4274.36] okay pimples acne okay don't take this
[4272.52 - 4276.92] supplement for you but when it comes to
[4274.36 - 4278.04] these drugs people are not taking it on
[4276.92 - 4279.84] doctor's
[4278.04 - 4281.24] prescription and they're getting side
[4279.84 - 4283.80] effects and even if your doctor
[4281.24 - 4286.16] prescribes it I would say to the doctors
[4283.80 - 4288.28] could you explore diet exercise
[4286.16 - 4290.32] aggressively by your patient first
[4288.28 - 4293.56] because we want people to live Healthy
[4290.32 - 4296.04] Lifestyles and this is so like and you
[4293.56 - 4299.76] and I both being in this profession we
[4296.04 - 4303.16] know losing 1 and A2 kilos a
[4299.76 - 4304.84] week by not doing anything just by it
[4303.16 - 4307.16] curbing your appetite and I don't know
[4304.84 - 4309.84] what else what other harm so if you're
[4307.16 - 4312.00] losing that kind of weight without doing
[4309.84 - 4314.08] what you and I prescribe imagine the
[4312.00 - 4316.56] amount of harm it's doing to your
[4314.08 - 4319.76] insights I think people should explore
[4316.56 - 4322.12] and doctors should explore these drugs
[4319.76 - 4327.04] once you have put the client through the
[4322.12 - 4329.88] regime of 300 workouts in a 365 day and
[4327.04 - 4333.52] you've done three meals a day into 300
[4329.88 - 4335.84] days 900 meals a year on bang and then
[4333.52 - 4339.08] if you're not getting a result explode
[4335.84 - 4342.28] drugs otherwise Simple Sleep simple
[4339.08 - 4344.60] exercise simple diet is the perfect cure
[4342.28 - 4347.32] the perfect medicine to maintaining a
[4344.60 - 4350.44] healthier Lifest style so simple simple
[4347.32 - 4353.44] exercise um you wrote a book on the
[4350.44 - 4356.64] 10minute workout uh what was the idea
[4353.44 - 4359.16] over there the idea was to get everyone
[4356.64 - 4362.00] to move for at least 10 minutes a day
[4359.16 - 4364.56] the idea was to tap into the population
[4362.00 - 4366.68] that says I have no time to work out the
[4364.56 - 4369.48] idea was to not give them an excuse
[4366.68 - 4373.00] saying I can't read this exercise and do
[4369.48 - 4375.20] it so now we have a QR code where you uh
[4373.00 - 4377.12] scan the QR code and you go to a video
[4375.20 - 4379.56] Library where you're doing the 10-minute
[4377.12 - 4382.12] workouts with me I'm doing them with you
[4379.56 - 4384.12] explaining to you I have the timer
[4382.12 - 4387.24] everything is set all you have to do is
[4384.12 - 4389.20] put on scan the QR code watch the video
[4387.24 - 4391.56] and follow me so if somebody wants to
