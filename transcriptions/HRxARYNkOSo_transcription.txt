Transcript: but in today's day and age of distraction phone rings this that TV Netflix e BB family how do you shut down there are thousands of sounds and there are thousands of things that you see every day but everything doesn't get attracted to you one is called abhas practice and second is called waga Detachment it's very important consciously you actually build these two qualities of you remember the first time we learned walking we never got attached to the failure why did you choose him in so many gurus and sages and and people of um exuberance in our past illustrious history why him Chaka was not a king he was a king maker have you ever heard about elephants being given meat no alcohol No No in fact subscribed by chanak and arastra not for ordinary elephants chanaka was training war elephants so think about it that pregnant elephants are given different diet and war elephants different diet so why only limited to human beings and nutritionist works for the whole society and all living beings Anna and Mana Anna is word Mana is mind they're interconnected there is a saying that if you want to cut a tree you should have the ax being sharpened from time to time correct meditation is that sharpening of the mind that you require because you work with the world with your mind you are known as a gentleman who guides people on in what I call as the the vibrational plane or the brain plane or the meditation plane where did that get started my entire life I look for gurus spiritual people people that vibrate with the universe and I had a chance encounter and now I'm going to ask those questions directly to the meditation Guru Dr P welcome thank you so much Ryan s it's an honor to be with you it's a it's it's a vibrational honor for me to be in your presence to be very honest with you I get attracted to people I think the universe makes me bump into them we met at the orange literature Festival in napur in nagpur and we just bumped into each other and I said to myself I do breath work I know about meditation but let me figure out if I can get an appointment with a guru who will talk about it and I was doing a lot of research about you before coming in here I'll be honest before that I knew nothing about you and then I was like hey Dr pill you've written about chanakya now in my podcast of H shots I'm like the guru of Moringa and amla and everything but doctor I do not know who chanaka is so can you please enlighten me sure in fact Ryan sir I'm glad you don't know about Chaka I have a new market because if you already know it then I'm not required in fact that's the way I think gurus work they take you to a new dimension so let me speak about two aspects of chanaka the person and the wisdom because persons have wisdom but they're too different and let me tell you in India at least to begin with most of us have heard about chanaka you may not know about chanaka so he lived in the 4th Century BC roughly 2,400 years ago and geographically he was in a place called as partly ra Parra is today's padna Bihar and he was a teacher son who became a teacher himself of political science what we call Rajan Niti he went to takshashila studied came back and he did many Fantastic things in his life for example he had dethroned a king called danan and made his student Chandra Gupta Moria the leader or the Emperor of India and all this is 2400 years ago when even Alexander came to India and with the intellect that he had remember chanaka was not a king he was a king maker he did not have an army but he trained armies so that's why he's called the king maker yes absolutely okay and he defeated Alexander also and all his work has been documented in the book called as arastra and chak ni so second part of the wisdom so even though the person is physically dead and gone you know you are an author yourself person can go but knowledge can remain wow so that's a documentation and even this podcast would be part of the Legacy that leave We Leave Behind true because in the olden days people used to write in Palm leaves now we have printed books but we are M to digital format remember friends that a podcast is not just for viewing it is a reference material for ages to come that's so powerful Dr P that's so powerful I never assumed that you know teaching in the current D and age the narip paata or the leaves that we wrote and everything now is the new age of podcast so one is now you have enlighten me who chanak is I'm looking at this person and he's a king maker but why did you choose him in so many gurus and sages and and people of exuberance in our past illustrious history why him in fact there's a saying you don't choose a person the person chooses you please enlighten us yeah so I'll tell you Chaka is what we call Open Source knowledge okay so it is already there many people have studied about him read about him worked about him but in my case it was a blessing that came to me so like any other person I was interested in Indian history Indian characters Indian Heroes gurus Saints sages and I've been reading a lot but you'll be surprised that when I started my entrepreneural journey almost 25 years ago you'll be surprised there was no guidance of course I had a formal MBA management study but you know I realized one thing that maybe the Western education is good we should never compare the systems of Education have the best of the best because we were a generation that were reading more English books but fortunately I started getting associated with lot of Indian literature in Sanskrit so the radak Krishan P before you know the Chaka that happened to me I would say it was absolutely normal yet colorful life typical person whose parents from middle class kind of family would say in life but in my case it was absolutely different I worked in some glamorous Industries I worked in the cricket industry I worked in the jewelry industry I worked in the music industry Sports industry and then unfortunately you know that uh part of my life got over I became an entrepreneur an entrepreneur then fortunately I'm lucky that my my father-in-law and my wife also and mother-in-law agreed that even though it's an entrepreneur struggling he's worth marrying but then afterwards my thirst for knowledge never ended I continued my wife is a great supporter and that's when I said I want to run my company in a way that Indian companies would run traditionally because we were the richest part of the world it is not that you know we did not have management skills or we did not have wealth and therefore I discovered arastra arastra technically means the wealth of knowledge and the knowledge of wealth repeat that again the wealth of knowledge and the knowledge of wealth wealth so we in as India ancient we had a wealth of knowledge but currently we don't have knowledge of wealth is where we have a knowledge of wealth but it's very I would say than what absolutely sub we need to come out of that submissive and so let's understand our models yeah along with global models so today we cannot say I me myself we have connect we are living in interconnected world so what happens in one part of the world will definitely happen everywhere but at the same time you should know your traditional models also so India was the richest country in the world I started wondering how and then I found the answers in AR shastra That's What chak attracted me so I'm just pulling back to Sanskrit is it true that they say that Sanskrit is a very logical language and recently somebody wrote an article in the newspaper how if AI was applied to all the languages in the world Sanskrit would be the best medium to teach AI absolutely in fact I have a friend in I Bombay he actually has used Sanskrit as a programming language and he's got a presidential award also for that I think he's the guy who wrote the article only maybe so Sanskrit and chanakya and then marriage and then you did all of that and everything so you are known as a gentleman who guides people on in what I call a is the the vibrational plane or the brain plane or the meditation plane where did that get started before marriage after marriage what was the story right from the birth right from the birth because my father is a meditator and a meditation teacher also okay so for everyone listening in father was a meditation teacher and a meditation person himself I was born in the family of a yogi okay where my question lies is to get to the fastest place of meditation do I need to reborn to a father who's doing meditation or do I need to find a guru or I have 11-year-old child do I start meditating as a father and teach him so how important is it for parents to teach the Next Generation about the knowledge of anything so what is your journey with your father when you were born in the womb with this meditation please expand I think you answered the question rightly it is the parents who are to be Role Models this is saying in parenting children don't listen to you they will watch you so if you meditating they'll meditate if you're reading books they will do so did you watch your father meditate yes can you remember your earliest memory absolutely I still remember a fight between my father and mother and so it was very interesting this is not documented anywhere fight between father and mother now everyone's tuning every married couple should fight and that's the beauty of any relationship and you remembered that abolutely so what was the story so the story was an instance I still remember of course like any husband and wife they us to have their conversations and I'm sure you are listen to them without them knowing it also some of them so my mother used to always wonder this particular person my father used to meditate for 7 to 8 hours a day 7 to 8 hours a day and remember I'm talking about a working day on Sundays or holidays used to make it for 12 14 hours a day absolutely so you know the conversation I heard was that you know she used to feel you know he's a very different person because other husbands of her friend Circle would be going out not that he never went out but it's very strange right for a person to sit down at the floor and meditate for so many hours and meditation or spiritual chanting to a god or something or just pure no thoughts so there are different schools of meditation he follows what is called as a vipasana meditation mhm and once in a year or twice in year he used to go for what is called The 10day Meditation Retreat and in that format you know Mantra chanting is not very much it's absolute silence I've had friends who have gone that and I'm like for 9 or 10 days you didn't speak to anyone how is that possible and they like it is possible once you connect inside absolutely in fact my father used to later on go for 45 days wow I'm sure your mother was not very pleased when he came back which was happy he was a great husband a great father but this were the kind of a background and ecosystem that I was born in did your mother ever meditate uh I think she was the bti person so for her Mantra chanting was the so we all have our own way of of meditation so you saw this first memory and what was your first memory of you beginning to start meditation my father pushed me so it's important that we push our children so like how my parents pushed me to study or I push my kid to do karate or go for yoga I think it's important right so I think it's very important to give them an exposure initially it can be pushing but after two three attempts if you don't enjoy it you'll come out in my case the initial push was there but after two three times it became part of me but if you had not pushed me I would have never got exposed to it so important for parents to direct the children into new learnings in life and I think it's the responsibility of the parent to also learn yes to be able to push the child into that new exposure okay so now we we're getting the story and how you are a guru of this meditation and your practice and all what's the best time of the day to meditate you know I'll tell you after a point at the highest level you go beyond time meditation is not about you know okay I medit for 2 minutes 1 minute 5 minutes in the initial stages when you're taking baby steps those matter actually meditation is not a process it's a state of mind it's not a verb it's a noun H so that's the highest level but yes initially when you are a beginner in the field of meditation you can choose those hours where you you have less disturbance do you believe modern day technology distracts the mind to being focused and on a meditative state of being I believe the other way modern day technology is an asset for meditation please expand Dr so let me tell you if you're a beginner of meditation and let's say you don't have a physical Guru yet there's so many meditation apps so go for it but I'll tell you don't get distracted buy gadgets use gadgets so when you're meditating be consciously putting the mobile or the gadget off yeah so that's my problem okay so I'll put on an app and then a client will call and then wife will call and some and then suddenly you see an article on LinkedIn and so you get deviated so what your advising us is stick to the path using technology but try and control the filters and technology that don't distract you absolutely sagely advice from a modern day Guru okay so now I'm going to get into a little bit of a deep dive and more substance okay so Dr P what are the three most important qualities that still hold relevance from the ancient times today in the modern times that every individual needs to become or acquire to become successful in the current day lifestyle so I think for any success be it in the ancient world or today's world or the future world the three qualities that require for becoming successful in any field physically fit mentally alert and intellectually brilliant so let me explain that please understand even if you're on a spiritual journey you require a fit body yoga starts from there if you study the panjali yoga Sutra it starts with Yama Nama Asana pranayama so I think you are in that field making people physically fit but also mentally alert what is mental alertness remember a human being is a composition of not just the physical body but emotions and that could be both both negative and positive kindness love all this are positive kind of an emotion but negativity is also there fear guilt now if you're not mentally stable even if you are the most skillful person you can lose the game so mental alertness and that's comes from the high quality of meditation that you do a meditative person is aware of every thought that passes through his mind and an advanced Yogi can actually go into a state of no mind lot of people say you know mind is distracted that's the very nature of mind if the mind doesn't have thoughts then it's not mind but an advanced Yogi can decide when to think and when not to think that's powerful very powerful in fact there are states when people say okay for half an hour I'll not have a thought but in today's day and age of distraction phone rings this that TV Netflix yeah wo BB family how do you shut down so it it's a shutdown right it's like it's like putting your computer on hibernate mode you choose to press press the button so just expand a little bit more on this so there is two Sanskrit words for this to become an expert in any field including meditation one is called abhas practice and second is called waga Detachment so you'll be surprised there are thousands of sounds and there are thousands of things that you see every day but everything doesn't get attracted to you so let's say if you see a book and you're a book lover the book will attract you just besides the book there could be a toy you may not get attracted to the toy so it's very important that thoughts also are like that you'll be surprise you got thousands of thoughts but you don't recreate all thoughts so for example let's say to do a podcast and if you hear podcast for in my case Chaka whoever it is my mind will get attracted so the Mind Builds on certain thoughts and they don't get attracted to certain thoughts it's very important consciously you actually build these two qualities of constant practice you remember the first time we learned walking we never got attached to the failures have you ever remember you're going to your mother and say mommy please teach me walking the way you learned others failures are not your failures so it's very important you take your own Journey so every meditator actually has got his own Journey lot of people say I see light I see you know some Visions don't get carried away if you don't see don't feel bad some people listen to music it's okay how do you get you know this concentration level in a distracting World remember there are two three tips for this the first one is is that control technology let not technology control you I'm a great fan of technology in fact I believe in the best gadgets I invest in the best gadgets and I feel that's a great blessing for Our Generation it can connect you to any part of the world in a split of a second but at the same time let's say you know I am not having technology I still have the human mind and that's where intellectual Brilliance comes in so let me give an example I was doing a training program with the Indian armed forces and they're very particular you know very specific time every second matters to them because the armed forces the mistake of a minc is a matter of life and death life and death yes and I still remember you know we had set up the all laptop PowerPoint presentations and all and as you know technology can fail any moment and they so worried because you know I was on the stage and the technology was not working you know what I told them let's start the lecture sir the PPT we are setting it up give us 5 minutes after 5 minutes I told them remember the pp may not work but I'm there still working and therefore I always say that you know please understand technology as a distraction if you're getting too much dependent on it but technology has a asset if you can use it other thing is that are you disciplined with distractions so I'll give a simple example today a phone a mobile phone is not just a phone it's a communicator of social media you have so many apps there a WhatsApp maybe you have have a LinkedIn maybe you have you know an Instagram or whatever YouTube now thing is that let's say you have a thought you to call up your family member a wife a friend or somebody you know now you pick up the phone to actually call your call somebody what do you do get distracted to something first you go to the WhatsApp then you have this problem called foro fear of missing out can you be disciplined saying that I will look at the WhatsApp nothing wrong I mean you should use the WhatsApp but thing that can you consciously say no I picked up the phone for making a call let me complete the call and then come back to Whatsapp but when you look at the WhatsApp after 3 4 messages you suddenly realize why did I pick up this phone so that's distraction without discipline I know people who are very disciplined with their mobile very disciplined and let me tell you about myself I reply to at least 500 messages on Whatsapp personally every day I reply back to every single mail I reply back to every single call but that doesn't mean you know I'm a addict to them but I say okay there's a time okay if I can't take it I'll take it later on so it's very important in a distracted World be disciplined and you'll use the benefit of your mind being active and also technology that can be helped I think whatever you're saying from me as a nutritionist holds at the same plane of level if I replace technology with eating wow don't be distracted I know you need to know what is your goal so these are really ancient words of wisdom which are so practical and so common sense but sometimes we forget to connect the dots you know speaking of connecting the dots and you said this earlier that when you're in a place and you see a book and you have a love of reading and there's a toy next to it your focus your razor sharp Focus or your thought process takes you towards the book now I love to read and they say that all readers are leaders it's a very famous quote what is your opinion of developing the habit of reading and I think today podcasting is a new form of reading uh video making is a new form of uh reading video editing is a new form of reading so do you feel this concept of intellectual stimulation is important to become a successful leader 100% an intellectual stimulation can happen through different methods even though I'm a writer I say books are only one form of knowledge you mentioned about podcast there are so many videos coming out now and maybe tomorrow it could be using AI maybe they'll clone you I don't have to be physically present but the thing is that don't get carried out by the glamour part of it lot of people have this habit of you buying the book Because of its cover and title people actually do that yeah they do people go to movies because there's a great star in it I mean intellectually you say okay I like a great star but what's the content so what's very important is that today it's a generation of over information and intellectually you should be able to dissect what is called in an ancient culture called a via buddhi so I can consume a lot of things free but is it having any nutrition for my intellect wow powerful words nutrition value for my intellect so so when leaders have to read how do they know what to consume do we rely on the ancient wisdom that you're attracted to it or what are your words of wisdom so I tell you all leaders have one common problem time management true if you're a leader you always have this as the biggest problem time management so I'll tell you how to manage time with books because books can take away a lot of your time and especially when you're reading a book you don't want to get distracted so I'll tell you there are lot of sec in fact which maybe I do write on these topics also so I'll tell you a simple thing never read a book if it doesn't interest you just because to read a book be very choosy about the books you read Because books can make you or break you interesting so I just want to read it's okay and it's like you know what's your main meal course and then what's your supplementary like you know pickle is not a main course that's just for taste you know a desert is not your main course but that's you know end with the sweet now think about it what's your main course so if let's say you're a leader and you are leading let's say the Armed Forces you can be corporate leader you can be a political leader you can be a scientific leader so I think you have to be very focused that if I'm Armed Force leader I will read a lot of books on the Army leadership and by the way there are thousands of books on that for a change you can read a poem you can read a book on maybe some non-fiction or fiction book that's okay but your core subject so I think it's very important to choose your field like for me I read I read more than 400 books on chanaka but that doesn't mean I only read chanaka so the concept is 8020 80% read what is your subject 20% to other subjects otherwise you'll only get one-sided so I read a lot of Chaka and some other stuff also so speaking of the other stuff and all uh what does your daily routine look like when you're not traveling what are this other 20% that you're looking at and there's something known as the din Chara your routine how did you master this what is your day like give us insights into your life which maybe the youngsters out there who are listening in or watching in can get some sort of crystallization what does a meditation guru's day look like so I'll tell you for everyone especially youngsters remember you'll never be young forever there'll come a time will you have a family you'll have more responsibilities but my Dinara is what Chaka suggested in the AR shastra have a plan and go with the flow have a plan and go with the flow okay expound please yeah so you should have a timable I'll get up at this particular time I'll do this this routine work I'll tell you how I do it at my life but never become rigid because you're living with others there's an emergency you can't say no no it's time for meditation your mother has to be rushed to hospital you can't say it's my time meditation time so you should know this because we live in a society now coming back how do you plan I'll tell you I plan my my personal life into four quarters in a day okay because I'm married I have children so my four quarters first thing in the morning which I get up by 5 5:30 even before the others wake up and even before the sun wakes up or sun rises this called me time that's my meditation time I study in the mornings my scriptures I go for a walk my regular exercises you can you meditate during a walk yes it's possible absolutely I can meditate when I am driving also and this takes practice does take practice and where would somebody start uh sitting quietly for 1 minute a day 1 minute let's all start by stating a comment below on this podcast I am going to start meditating one minute a day we'll ask Dr P how to start with 1 minute but let's commit to 1 minute a day so you're in you're you're going walking in the morning that's one compartment of your day then so that's the morning me time but when I come back then you know I never read a newspaper or any WhatsApp message till 8:00 in the morning don't touch your phone till 8:00 or like 3 hours you're already awake don't touch because we need to get the me time and this not touching the phone is what philosophy so I'll tell you what because as you rightly pointed out the mind can get distracted you know the first thing I do in the morning after all my me time after get ready I do my meditations and everything all my spiritual activities I read a newspaper 8:00 sharp to 8:30 I'm reading the whole newspaper I don't read it word by word but I get the essence AA Modi has done that Ukraine problem and you'll be surprised you'll be surprised WhatsApp is just picking up from there so before the WhatsApp message comes in I know what's going to come in the WhatsApp generally good morning messages and all now comes what is called my professional time okay so after 8:00 you know you start planning your day you have to go and have meetings etc etc till 8:00 even a family generally is in a very low their own me times they're getting ready for the day children have to go to school life has to make sure of the kitchen activities my father parents everything so I think that's the time you should yourself and don't disturb others now that's very important if you want people to respect your time please respect their time lot of people who want personal time disturb others personal times so that's the first thing professional time of course the day is very active where probably you know I do a lot of meetings podcast training programs and as you said you know sometimes out of Bombay also but I try and do it within the limits where are possible now comes the fourth box of my day called family time once I'm back home I'm absolutely normal my wife always jokes you know or chak because at the whole world you may be known but at the home you have to be absolutely normal I listen to my children I learned from them what they learned in the school and I learned from what my wife's experiences were my parents experiences were there and the fourth quarter which is very important for me and it is not a fixed quarter but throughout the day when I get gaps that is called reading time it can be also podcast time so for me there four things I do in every day balancing it out me time spiritual time what is called professional Time family time and what we call it research or reading time so these are the way I generally plan out and it works out well so you know we talked about these four zones in your life and it seems that you do a lot of multitasking but you have these zones now they say that all successful people multitask and multitask is not about doing 100 things at the same time but it's about doing one thing focused multiplied by 100 times can you discuss after these four zones how that essential time management is required for a person to become successful in life now it's indicative that you said you have these four zones but what are some of the secrets of your success in this multitasking and busy life that you have thank you that's where chaka's analysis comes in okay so you know mentally I have developed a interesting skill called us what's the priority now what's the priority now it's a very interesting skill to have you can have multiple things coming to you but you can only do one at a time this is seeing if you try to catch two birds at the same time you'll be neither able to catch either of them but that doesn't mean I want both the birds but let me hunt one the other will follow so mentally you need to prioritize for example if you look at your WhatsApp messages let's say you open up there 100 messages but you know there is something called pinning the top three can be pinned so what I do is basically whenever any thought comes to me maybe a phone call comes to me I prioritize saying that is it to be replied right now yes do it no I can't do it in the evening you'll be surprised many times people get addicted to just lifting up phones and the thought that I can give back a reply because already most of your cell phones have a call back option right the thing is that why are we so addicted that every time a thought comes and have to entertain it our grandparents if they wanted to meet up with each other they wrote a love letter that reach three months later yeah and today it's like you're addicted to a imate response which is I'm 10 seconds away but please wait for me to come so what you're saying to me to crystallize it for our audience is that in this world of multitasking have this one thought in your head what is my priority right now okay so nice words of wisdom and in speaking of wisdom want to just rewind a little bit back and you talked about your father and having a lot of wisdom to you and then the meditation that he did and the form of meditation uh was vipasana can you Enlighten us on the significance of this vipasana meditation and why have you chosen it as your conduit or your passion or your journey so give a little bit background about vasana it was technique of meditation taught by Lord gutam Buddha himself but interestingly what happened is that it knowledge was lost for many generations it was more popular outside India is it yeah yeah and a great uh I would say Saint in the previous generation his name was goink Kaji he was known as a founder of vasana he was born in BMA can you believe vipasana was a practice in BMA which came back to India wow what is vasana it's a technique of meditation there are many techniques like modern day we have a lot of gurus also like sish Shankar speaks about and teaches Sudan kria Kaa yoga lot of things I will not go into that coming back to vipasana it starts with the basic step which everybody can practice called as anaana which means watching a breath it comes in it goes out that's it do nothing interestingly to breathe we don't require efforts but we don't know how to watch our breath in fact in the Buddhist culture when you become a m the first exercise is to just sit down and watch your breath and believe me it's not easy it's not easy I try and do it with my yoga instructor and I'm gone to Disney World in the third breath so now I'm getting the significance anaana means the in and out so all we have to start doing is that one minute that you're asking us to sit down and meditate and in one minute can we focus on our breath is this the advice you're giving absolutely absolutely awesome so continue on your vasana the significance afterwards it doesn't stop with that please understand you're watching a breath Second Step many yogis do a different practice then is called they have to regulate the breath lot of people who start from meditation start to regulate the breath don't do that watch your breath for example in your field of nutrition you first study the patient what is the condition right now correct then you change the diet plan towards Health you don't just go say this is the diet plan follow it right now so people don't know how to was their breath they get into pranayama directly oh oh so this is a real interesting Insight don't try and teach 10th standard syllabus before you learn the first standard syllabus and the first standard syllabus is watch your breath and you can do it 24 hours if you're alert while walking on Al you can watch your breath oh so when you go on your morning walk I can watch my breath or if I'm driving the car I can watch my breath absolutely that and that brings you in a quality called as awareness see beinging alert and aware and Vigilant is a first step for spiritual life imagine you start with your breath you can later on watch your thoughts and you can dissect them it's like watching a movie you're not involved but you are watching it and you can say it's a good actor a bad actor there's a good noise there's a bad noise there is a nice music this music includes flute It Go go to a level it's not just music you're going to what is called barik so I work with a lot of athletes a lot of athletes and they practice really hard what's a good ball what's a bad ball they practice it to read it so I think for us the arm admy the non-athlete the general people we need to start practicing watching our breath watching our thoughts I think that's something that we take for granted start with your mental gym start with your mental gym I'm going to write that down this is going to be like the most important thing start with your mental gym it starts with a breath so we're breathing and we're going to the gym but there are no weights being lifted I think that's an even more difficult weight to lift it seems easy one minute a day try remember it's not 1 minute it's 60 seconds you never know how much you can gather mental strength by just watching a breath do it consciously start by sitting down but do it every day little bit more and you'll be surprised 1 to 2 minutes to 5 minutes later on you can do it for 1 hour also don't start with 1 hour you'll break down as a meditation coach as a meditation Guru you know I get this question is Diet follow right so the question over here is what I feel is people in the world do not do something unless it becomes a fashion or they are significantly convinced to do that new set of skills you are telling chanaka did this there's a manual you have done meditation vas's ancient from Goa and all of that stuff is there some hook or story or Revelation or statistic that we can give the listeners that may convince them to do meditation sure there is a saying that if you want to cut a tree you should have the acts been sharpened from time to time correct meditation is that sharpening of the mind that you require because you work with the world with your mind so you're working in the world you're not actually working with your hands and feet you're working with your mind and the more educated you are you're expected to be more intelligent but intelligence is not just about reading books or gathering more information I was about to go to that because like I asked you know readers are leaders so you just buy all the books keep it read it but is the book acquisition of book actually sharpening of the acts because I'm going with thought and breath over here in the meditation Department forgive me if I'm wrong over here it's the most laziest thing that I have to ask my body to do because anyway thought is there anywh breath is there why should I refine it because anyway I'm breathing anyway I'm thinking how does it make me a better human so two things here in meditation the awareness is not there anywh I'm breathing yeah I don't require to be aware of my breathing but why do I need to be aware of my breathing because there is a connection between the breath and the mind okay okay so let me tell you the two words in English one is called Mind m i n d just reverse the word m to w it becomes wind the mind and the wind are connected so you want to control the mind control your breath and if you control your breath you control the mind so they interconnected they two sides of the same so the breath is the wind yes and why it's important is that after stage of life especially leaders leaders don't work like workers it's a saying I heard workers work managers manage leaders lead but the question is where do future so so leaders have a thinking job that's so brilliant I had goosebumps just now I had amazing Goosebumps and I'll tell you why I had a mentor in my previous company and I us to always take my laptop and go into his cabin so he used to tell me take this Dabba out and this gentleman was 75 years old as a mentor and I would get angry as a youngster what do you mean this dubba this dubba is the future it's going to change the way the world works and everything but I got goosebumps now because of what you just said we need to control the thought but before you control the thought you need to think you need to be aware of your thinking so by me taking in that Dabba which was my laptop in I was not allowing my mind to do the thinking I was trying to distract myself at I'm doing thinking because the Dabba is giving me the thinking right so I just got goosebumps because of that wow wow talking about Goosebumps my department is food I'm going to be a little bit cheeky over here do you think food plays an important role in medication no it plays a very important role very important Ro okay so tell me what is your Deep dive on the very important with regards to food actually you're the guru for me in that space But my understanding if you are sitting for meditation two things don't overeat don't undereat the nutrition value maybe you can you know teach me better if you ovat you can fall to sleep because your energy goes into digestion if you don't eat you'll be thinking about food is it true that somebody went into very deep meditation and used food as the one connect with this worldly word to come back yeah what was that story was Swami via's Guru Ram Krishna param but remember he a PhD level he not the first standard second standard you know this highest stage of meditation is called as samadi samadi and even that this is stage called NPA samadi okay you're in that stage for you know a long period of time and you have no thoughts imagine you'll never come back from that state and because he was in a living body like you and me you know he was aware that if he goes into that state he the Trans State he may not come back a lot of saints across the globe in different cultures have been known to go into trans and totally get disconnected from the world remember they're not dead but you don't feel they're active now what happens that common man can get toally disconnected saying that maybe he's in coma he's in samadi he's not in coma he's not it's a different level and then there's an instent in sh sa Baba's life many people don't know this that you know he was going to trans consciously he told one of his devotees that I'll be out for 7 days out as in body yeah okay so there'll be no activity but I'll come back after 7 days so imagine now there is no activity s sa has gone into different trans into different world can you believe after 2 days all the devotees said he's dead okay let's burn him he said no my Guru has told me he'll come back he'll be surprised he came back after 7 days now Ram Krishna Pam so I had this particular I would say catch if I'm going to trans I will have one thought that will bring me back and he said okay I want a gab Jam so the way he used to come out the trans is very surprising just shout gulab jabun gulab jab gulab ja this great Master is stuck to gulab J it's not stuck because you don't have a thought like for example you know I say this the dad to make boys responsible it may look like a joke but what happens is that if somebody is irresponsible but through marriage he becomes responsible he has to come back every day home right pH where are you so the idea is that this particular point that when you go into that stage of thoughtlessness sometimes you have to come back with a thought the thought could be gab jamun or could be anything else as a nutritionist I wouldn't prescribe a gulab jamun maybe when I'm working with a modern day Guru I would think more like amla with dipped in Honey dates OD dates you know that would be good but in your experience Dr pilai in this meditative world of ancient sages gurus and all has there been any protocol written when it comes to nutrition uh to attain a meditative state in the ancient text have you come across anything so I have seen some references I mean not a student of nutrition like you so there are many references in two three books that I can tell you one is p yoga Sutra it talks about ahar V and V ahar V how do you think because thoughts are also food for the mind a good quality of thought can give you energy like a good food can nutrition can give energy for the body a negative thought can drain you energy imagine getting up with a nightmare you're already drained out true so this is the first book the second book is charaka Sam and shush samita these are aura books and of course ARA shastra also mentions about food for not only human beings but also for Animals plants also so there was an ancient wisdom about how to feed the Mind feed the soul feed the body feed the ecosystem can I give an example you'll be surprised that how food and the mind works have you ever heard about elephants being given meat no alcohol No No in fact subscribed by chak not for ordinary elephants elephants are herbus correct they don't eat meat but you'll be surprised was training war elephants and in war if you see every particular Army has got a war cry it is to energize you oh you know uh what war cries we have different countries different regiments have this war cries harar mahad and all those things you'll be surprised that's only at the verbal level drums and all the mind gets active now think about it that these elephants who are supposed to be going on attacking the enemy they were given alcohol alcohol not today's terms but certain herbs and all now what is to happen is that when you consume that your body suddenly becomes active your mind becomes active and that has to be directed so think about it that pregnant elephants are given different diet and war elephants different diets and they even today if you look at I work with the police department there are certain police academies where still they have horses yes correct and you'll be surprised they measuring how much quantity of food they had which quality the dogs that are there on the payroll of the government are actually being mapped with the nutrition value that they give so why only limited to human beings a nutritionist works with the whole society and all living beings so we should eat more out of Science and that's where we need to also connect so connect with your breath connect with your thought connect with your nutrition and connect with yourself connect with yourself people nowadays Focus mainly on an external Dimension fashionability how I'm looking flashy in society which bag am I carrying what car am I turning up in and all of this stuff fashion what would be the magic Mantra to be both happy inside and successful outside I love fashion so let me tell you what your one Indulgence that you can share with our followers Watchers you love Watchers I love watches okay but you know for me Watchers is not just about the the kind of a design part of it it's also a sense because I love Watchers it's a sense like you know a color that suits you may not suit me certain people watches because of the technicalities some people like Swiss watches not because it's costly the mechanism the mechanism part of it so for me that's one love you know some people love cars some people like clothing I do understand little bit of design also because Chaka spoke about designs but for me watches is one thing now coming back to the point of fashion you know it's very important that good product should be packaged well good product should be packaged well what's this got to do with my internal so if I'm a good human being okay internal I should be a man of character but that doesn't mean I have to be you know in rubbish all the time so why can't be good inside and fashionable outside but lot of people do the other way around they show fashion outside but the character is very loose you can attract people because of the external success for a limited period of time so we have to have a mix of spirituality and material success if the youngsters today had to reflect this because they constantly bombarded by marketing you know you need to wear this brand or you need to do do this or whatever it is and there are so many youngsters today that are impressionable one or two tips for these youngsters when they are 18 1920 they're not listening to Mommy Daddy they're listening to the world they're listening to podcast they're listening to other people out there what would the guru of meditation of Mind of thought talk to them and say beta these are three things I want you to do so three things I want to do is number one read the right books read the right books okay it's very important the reason is that because 18 19 20 is a very vulnerable age your future depends on the decisions that you take at this age your future is completely different because now you have to live your life in a very different way so the books that you read be choosy I'm not telling you don't read you know glamorous books or romantic books it's a part of life but you know at that particular point of time you to be sure about your financials your career your relationships so there a lot of good books there and what you said Ryan sir is also important that we read read scientifically analyzed books for me books is not just about storytelling imagine today the highest category of Book Sales in India is actually non-fiction book somebody who's a scientist somebody who's done work in that field who's got the experience so first thing is read books second you know please you know balance between work and life because please understand you'll have to work and don't get burnt out fortunately we are a generation where we don't have problems much of Roy K but we have to be careful which kind of a you wear which kind of a Roy you eat or don't eat good one and if you have a small house it can still be aesthetically beautiful true people say if you can't build a small house beautifully you'll never keep a big house beautiful that's so wise that's so wise so it's very important that you have this particular you know sense of beauty also in your life so work life balance work life balance and the third important thing please spend time with yourself lot of youngsters are in that whole mood of you to go for a party time me time I me myself so would you tell a youngster today the me time is devoid of TV devoid of mobile phone which can distract and div of friends also you may be hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on one second this is important I you're telling in 18 19 20 year watch your friends don't have friends or be divid of friends please expand this thought so we unravel it for the youngsters out there please understand life is never a lonely Journey you have to have friends with you and friends for life in fact in our country in our culture we say your best friend is your spouse but remember one thing you need to understand that friend is also an individual okay you know I'll tell you this whole problem is about privacy you may have a best friend but he or she also requires his or her time don't you require your time because friends coming too close also is a problem see I'll tell you there's a concept called sayami twins H they together but they can't be separated it's a problem so what is important that in your age you should have the right friends choose your friends carefully you can be friendly to everyone but your have core friends a five six of them are very important support them they should support you but remember one thing there are times when you should sit alone without a friend also because at the end of it you're an individual and you should maintain the individuality when I say individuality I'm not talking about ego so for example you know it's very important that we spend time in solitude don't be alone but enjoy your Solitude also otherwise it can lead to loneliness being alone can be very very lonely and loneliness is a psychological problem many developed countries today having loneliness as a psychological problem mental health at the same time you know in the name of loneliness we forget that we should enjoy being alone also so if you can take I'm not taking you know 24 hours you to be you know shut up in a room but can you sit down 10 minutes all alone without your mobile without your gadgets without a friends also can you just go for a walk alone and of course after 10 minutes take your friend along wise words of wisdom Dr P absolutely wise I wish I met you when I was 18 years of age now I'm getting very very enamored because you explained to me about how he wrote how to make King makers I want to become king of my life my followers and our fans and everybody everybody wants to bring be the king or the queen of their life what he wrote was in the happiness of the people is the happiness of the king it's a very important thought of the chanakya now why does everybody need to think like a king or think like a leader because there is no what do you say reward what is your words of wisdom for people to transcend to the next level maybe in this lifetime or the next time what is it and why is it important to think like a leader let me tell you a story so there was a spiritual Guru and everybody you know is to go for his blessings and advice and there's a very popular scene that whoever goes to him for taking his guidance mentoring blessings will become a leader and then there a intelligent boy intelligent means asking questions that doesn't guarantee intelligence H just because your questioning doesn't make you intelligent but okay we should answer questions so this intelligent boy ask everybody goes to meet that Guru so maybe let's say 10 people go how can 10 of them be leaders CU in a group only one can be a leader like if there is a game of cricket let's say there's a team of cricket only one person give me Captain how can everybody be a leader you know what the person said you are right that everybody cannot be a leader of the same team but everybody can be leader of different teams for example one person can be a sports leader one person can be a political leader one person can be a leader in the field of science person like you is a leader in the field of nutrition I am a leader in my space so why it is important to think like a leader because you strive for excellence a leader is not a position in fact a great leader is the one who creates more leaders lot of people in leadership position don't like to give up the position and that's where the downfall starts so leadership is a way of thinking and let me tell you leadership is also a spiritual quality as you quoted the Sans sura a leader is not about I me myself that's ego and that's where downfall starts a leader is the one who wants to make his people happy so you decide your field of leadership like you have chosen nutrition I have chosen Chaka maybe somebody else has chose writing or maybe you know discovering something business leader but there you don't think like you know the more you give the more you are a leader I'm going off my research you have a very thought provocating information to me leader should not have ego right ego thought how does it come does it come from the womb does it come from a parental upbringing does it come in college years does it come in life is the social media influencing our ego because I'm trying to ask you this question question that I think a lot of people who I have met who do meditation the ego is very humble so can you kind of light my lamp on this that I constantly you know when I'm leading my teams as a nutritionist I have to keep reminding myself be humble but the ego comes in very fast so I'm getting a free lesson here today free consultation with Dr P I just realized that so what's your advice to me so let me start with the first question where does the ego gets created remember the child if you see the little children especially the one who are below 5 years you'll find that they less of ego they're very innocent they can mix up with anybody and everybody they don't understand concepts of religion Community nationality gender also for that matter you know where ego starts you'll be surprised the mirror you know the child when is born doesn't even know what is a mirror and then we train them you're a boy you're a girl you to wear pink you to wear blue and then one day you show your mirror and the child starts wondering a this makes me different so there is something called body Consciousness I'm different from you you're different from me and then you want to develop this individuality the body and when you grow you want to build up your muscles you to build up your style fashion and you start being different please understand that's only the physical ego that you're different from them but what happens we start categorizing them in different formats for example I'm the boss you are the junior I have more salaries you don't have you'll be surprised if you have the spiritual blent of mind you can work with everybody without and with hierarchy also for example let's say you know Ryan s you give me example that when you started like anyone of us a small office you'll be surprised that I'm sure during those days you wouldn't mind you know brooming your office also no I was chapari and I was vice president so all put together so P2P Pune to president P to president I like that P2P now think about it today you got 80 plus people and tomorrow you hundreds of them one day if the office is not clean you don't mind cleaning up because you don't have that you know that I'm the boss of course I'm the boss I may have somebody to clean the office but I don't have that now what is the lesson for leadership how do you keep your ego under control from time to time do the last man's job that's not your job from time to time do the last man's job but that's not your job as a leader yeah your job is to it's kind of saying keep yourself grounded grounded from time to time and then take off don't come down so down that you forget that you're supposed to take everybody up so it's very important to be aware that everybody has got a role to play and as a leader you have to use your power also please understand leadership is not just being humble a lot of people act humble but are not humble humility is a strange thing the day you think you have it you lost it it's very very interesting and I think when you talk about ego and coming down to that one day of doing the the first job or the last job in the organization I think what is sounding Out in my head is parents cuz I'm a father you're a father and we are at that age where if I go somewhere people say uncle to me right so I'm like going into that role which is how do I lead like a wise parent or if I have my family how do I behave like a wise parent so in the sutras OR in chanakya's Formula was there anything about parenting and what are the significance of any sutras regarding parenting so let me especially for Indian parents okay parenting is a role that ends unfortunately that becomes an identity for life I'm sorry parenting is a role that ends but unfortunately for Indian parents it becomes an identity forever let's say tomorrow your child is 60 you still be a parent no but I get where you're going because yeah it is true so you're saying this is especially for Indian parents and why is that that's where chak advice comes in because we too attached to our children please understand family is important but the roles in a family changes roles in a family changes with the evolvement of time is that what you're saying abely absolutely like for example when you don't have children you're still part of your family yes when you go to your spouse you're still part of your family yes when you become parent you're still part of your family yes but you know when I'm a parent I remain a parent forever interesting that's why I tell people know your body is the most expensive real estate you can change everything on the planet but you can't change your parents you're stuck with them for life so chanaka is advising to decouple so here is the Sutra that comes in and very interesting on parenting till 5 Years love your child for the next 10 years discipline him or her and after that consider the child your friend wise words so first 5 Years love your child unconditionally even if they break your latest mobile you can't do anything you're innocent they're not doing it consciously but next 10 years their minds are thinking their intellect is developing so you have to be logical with them so basically the age of about 6 to 20 is when we're disciplining them so we have to learn to say no to our children not necessarily no I would say logically telling them what is right and wrong see no is not the only way of disciplining correct logically telling them what is right and wrong it is called via Bui so I I I'm I mean this is very very in the high plane of intellectual and I'm scratching my brain here I'm coming down to my basic Prime Primal uh nutrition brain which is Papa I want a mobile phone of course I'm 11 years of age now as a parent my thought process is do I give him a mobile phone do I not give him a mobile phone so what would chakya say so I tell you that's a mistake can you avoid giving a phone can I avoid giving a phone you may not give your phone you may not own a phone yeah he has given you the first right of denial that's all he will anyway earn it so the thought itself that if my child is asking a phone your answer would be yes or no who told the answer has to be only two boxes I'll tell you how I deal with such a situation I know my child is still 11 son has asked for a phone already already okay my daughter Al they come together so there is a CH com combin power I have a combin power my wife also ask your mother you know please understand you have to respect that they born a generation of gadgets they're smarter generation absolutely and they're more informed than us yes what I say that of course you'll have a mobile but please tell me the reason why you want it ah wise words from an ancient Sage I'm going to use this can I borrow this for my son please tell me why you require and then you'll be surprised you can guide him before giving the phone H so for example he wants you you know because children make you different answers I tell you a small story and then you'll understand how important a phone is for a child so there was this particular friend of mine his daughter was in 10th standard board exam okay so exams are and the M was taken away she had a mobile it was taken away 2:00 the 2:00 in the night this person wakes up and he finds in his daughter's room there is some light so father he goes inside and he sees the girl on a mobile so angry so upset he just takes the mobile breaks it and then wife comes out and you continue studying let's go and sleep next day when he's cool down a little bit the wife you know what please go and talk to your daughter never do that to your daughter well then know she was not studying she was using the mobile and all we had given a strict rule not to use the mobile during exam time she went and she was crying the papa you know what I was doing on the mobile I was checking out for a marksheets sorry exam Hall ticket because everything is digital today so my friends got it till the last moment yesterday night I did not get it I was downloading it and you just break it away now how do I go for my exam to use your Mobile know the idea is that people will use mobile but the thing is that you have to be conscious what they're using for so if it's going to be a social media addiction why do you need the phone yeah tell me why you need the phone and then you can discipline like I say you take my mobile take your mobile but use it for only one hour or half an hour what do you decide wise words of parenting so staying with chanaka and chanaka is going to become like if I went back in a time capsule I'll be like I would like to do chanakya's diet plan that that would be my thought process cuz I'm falling in love with this process let's have a small discussion on this chanakya nitis enlighten me about it on how the chanakya nitis can improve our lifestyle so chanakya's nitis Niti the word means policies stategies plan it all comes from an intellect way of intelligent way of living a life so as we said the different stages of life for example if you are below 20 your primary responsibility is to be a student after 20s to let's say 50s it's to bring up a family after 50 you have to give back to the society because your basic financial needs are taken care your children are settled and after 75 you're supposed to be 100% focused on spirituality and he gives advis us at every stage how to be a good student how to be a good husband or parent as we saw or a good mother how do you bring up your children how to actually give back to society and finally how to give up the world also when I say give up the world is not death of the body but you know lot of people with high egos cannot give up their positions that's why there's a concept called SAS you have to live the body so chakia strategies and needes are applicable for every generation at every point of time so let me give you two examples for our discussion if you're a student your primary responsibility is studies but it is not studies like today it is becoming more memory today education system has become an examination system so a good student has a quality of learning from from anybody and everybody not just the teachers so if you're watching a podcast and learning great but can you apply that in your life so Chaka prepar students to learn from every teacher unfortunately today's generation they were rating a teacher imagine if chanaka was around right now it's okay his Google reviews would have been split I still remember one small child had come to a parent and say this teacher is not bad sorry this teacher is not good he or she is bad and the father a very wise father as you know are you comparing two teachers ah compared to what exactly so maybe that particular teacher doesn't have great communication skills that's why he cannot hold your attention but that attention can be held through a video on the screen that doesn't make a great teacher a teacher is a person who has got wisdom of that subject so never compare because some person uses a different methodology of teaching so how to be a good student now coming back what is the responsibility of a father there's a chak for that also so the responsib of Father are three point number one to earn for the family let me look like you know today we have wives also earning let me tell you very frankly let the wife own that's her money but if she doesn't ear it's your responsibility because all since I married my wife 15 years ago she's to always say my money is my money and your money is my money I thought origal dialog so that's why you'll be surprised that the role of a parent is number one to earn money and please understand wealth is not neglected in our society we are the only country in the world which is spiritualized wealth Lakshmi lakmi is also shaki if you don't have money what kind of a life you'll have I'm not trying to tell you that be you know overboard but basic money is required for survival for good education travel quality time with the family having two support systems of domestic help is good but you have to pay them so the husband has to earn money second important thing he has to give quality education to the children and third give moral values teach them the difference or explain to them the difference between right and wrong absolutely so at every stage there are chanaka niis speaking of chanaka nitis in your life you've lost weight in between and you consciously did that uh you had a medical Scare at some point in your life was there a realization to losing weight what was your thought process would you like to share with the world how a guru of meditation decided to say that I don't need the medication right and my breath is in my control my thought is in my control and my health is in my control so what is your gift to the world what is your experience to the world from your body and health perspective so I'll tell you I've been very fortunate that the doctor that I went for treatment is my student only oh so I been lucky that I don't have doctors I have friends for doctors like you nutrition friend now so when I was admitted I still remember my wife my family everybody was taking care of me the doctor he's a student his name is Dr W so he comes to me and he ask me a very interesting question how do you visualize yourself 10 days from today the doctor asked you this and he was your student student of meditation and also at the Mumbai University where I ah okay so he know your mind so he decided to ask the guru this question so how do you visualize yourself so in hospital that time I visualize myself healthy strong and more fitter than what I'm today or what is in the past he said keep that thought with you doctors don't work with medicines they work with the mind of the patients wow doctors don't work with the medicines doctors work with the mind of the patients this is a meditation Guru who's saying this and that's very powerful another Goosebump moment today so when he told me this you know for me I said okay the medicines are required the healing part of it the treatment part of it is there but finally how do you visualize yourself you're speaking about sports person they visualize themselves of even before they go to play the game so finally health is also a mind game coming back consciously then you have to do the steps given by experts like you follow this do this do do this I followed that but I'll tell you a story it happened in my family with my father when he was in his 40s he was admitted and I still remember as a child but he became more healthy today at 89 years he climbed the Himalayas wow he still goes by local train and I used to always wonder you know how come he's so healthy at this St he's a role model he said at 40 I became conscious of my health and today I'm more fitter than many of them around I think one of the reasons I wanted to meet with you was to dwell into the power of the mind and you can't become a better version of yourself by eating better Dal chavel Roti I seriously believe this because when you put that food into your body your mind is also telling that body how it's accepting that food so I think even when you are not well you can come out of that you know back foot that you're on by just telling your mind with meditation with thought process that you're going to come out in the front those sunkit words here Anna and Mana Anna is food Mana is mind they're interconnected so Ana paana was there and now is Anna and Mana Anna and mana mana is mind Anna is f so F and mind are also related three things that you do from a food perspective eat less okay eat consciously okay and eat right the quality and the substance that you eat I think in his previous life he was a nutritionist before he he came into this and we best friends collaborating with each I'm sure a lot of people have asked you this question if chanaka would have been alive what would be the three problems that he would have solved in today's world to make our youngsters have a better Universe a better thought process a better life three things you have focused on leadership leadership leadership we require good leaders we require spiritual leaders and we require result oriented leaders can you expand on this we spoke about leadership a lot and chak wrote the book on leadership every team every society every country requires good leaders even a family requires good leaders right true you're living in an apartment or a society you require a good chairman there so I think leadership is the requirement of every particular Community institution or country chak created that it's like attack the top correct it everything is okay but important is also the spiritual leaders ship leadership can become a power game and we' seen that in so many organization right and what does opposition have to do only oppose so please understand that spiritual leadership has got the quality of leading the people without an ego therefore the ideal leader for chak is called Raji Raji is detached wow and please understand the day comes you to live don't even think back there's a very famous saying genius is know is a person who knows when to stop M so suppose you're a leader and you're given a 5year term people want that second term fifth term 20 ter it's okay if people won't elect you but lot of people can't give up leadership position and only a spiritual leader knows when to give up not give up you know just that responsibility will continue after the position goes therefore the last point of leadership is that the leader should be highly qualitative leader who is result oriented so leader comes and I'll build a ro or let's say you know I will create 20 part but you'll be happy only when the 20th podcast is actually broadcasted you not rest till then so I think leaders have so many dimensions J spoke about and this is beyond Generations so all of you please understand have a spiritual base think about being a leader of youri don't compare decide a of entrepreneurs you decide which field you want to but become a leader have a spiritual base as we discussed you know it's important to even meditate for leaders and finally if you take up a task stop not till your goal is achieved stop not till your goal is achieved which means also be relentless to your goal absolutely you have to deliver results that's leadership true you can't just be a floating leader and not deliver result at the end of the day Dr P it's been an amazing session with you today and a question out of ancient sagely wisdom to wrap up today's podcast if Dr P was stuck on an island and he could choose only five foods to take with him and they don't have to be nutritious what would be his five favorite foods fruits Foods aord yes yeah so you can take five maybe I'll be a little bit liberal you can take 10 foods but five foods that you would love to take with you if you were stuck on an island and you had no communication with any other island or the rest of the world so can I rephrase the question yeah will the food be only limited to something that I eat because my answer contains something Beyond just the food I take for eating so can can we take the physicality of food five items and the other five foods that Dr P has in mind Apple okay uh dry fruits which includes your almonds to and these are stuff that you really like of course your favorite favorites and the third one is curd okay I don't know why I love Cur these are three fruits but
