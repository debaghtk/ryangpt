[0.08 - 4.72] hey guys if you're not able to watch my
[2.28 - 7.16] long form content of podcast here are
[4.72 - 9.68] some short form clips for you to enjoy
[7.16 - 12.16] but I've never asked you this question
[9.68 - 14.40] why did you get into this world of being
[12.16 - 17.08] a fitness influencer Guru and even
[14.40 - 19.36] having a world-class business about it
[17.08 - 23.32] so what's the story where did it start
[19.36 - 25.36] it actually started u quite early uh
[23.32 - 28.44] when I was growing up uh we were living
[25.36 - 30.04] in a joint family and my dad's younger
[28.44 - 32.64] brother used to be a great table tennis
[30.04 - 34.28] player we had a table at home and every
[32.64 - 36.16] day in the evening some 15 20 office
[34.28 - 38.36] friends would come home and the vibe
[36.16 - 40.20] used to be once again 15 20 people would
[38.36 - 41.84] come into your house to play table
[40.20 - 43.60] tennis they would play for 3 to four
[41.84 - 45.36] hours right and all the kids would be
[43.60 - 48.76] watching this yeah all the kids would be
[45.36 - 50.36] watching and playing also so we had no
[48.76 - 52.56] option than to you know just pick up the
[50.36 - 54.76] B bat and play because playing a sport
[52.56 - 56.48] was so glamorized uh back in the days in
[54.76 - 58.12] my house so that is where it actually
[56.48 - 59.60] started and table tennis is a fast sport
[58.12 - 61.52] requires a lot of agility and things
[59.60 - 63.56] like that so it started there I picked
[61.52 - 67.84] up table tennis so my fitness journey
[63.56 - 69.76] started with playing a sport and then uh
[67.84 - 71.84] uh because I had an opportunity of
[69.76 - 73.52] playing with people at home there were
[71.84 - 76.16] many good players who were coming to my
[73.52 - 79.24] house so I just got into playing table
[76.16 - 81.28] tennis well and was the icsc champion at
[79.24 - 83.92] some point very early uh in my school
[81.28 - 86.48] days then later I picked up basketball
[83.92 - 89.12] uh loved that sport played that for many
[86.48 - 91.84] years in Junior School uh so for many
[89.12 - 93.92] many years I was just playing sports
[91.84 - 97.92] what also happened I started lifting
[93.92 - 99.80] weights around the age of 14 and that
[97.92 - 103.16] was a very different story so I was a
[99.80 - 105.28] very skinny kid uh and because of that I
[103.16 - 107.92] was subject to bullying and a lot of
[105.28 - 110.12] body shaming and uh you know all kind of
[107.92 - 112.56] unpleasant experiences especially to do
[110.12 - 115.08] with how you look so I wasn't very happy
[112.56 - 117.44] about where was this which part of India
[115.08 - 120.56] uh I I'm from North India I was born in
[117.44 - 122.24] Agra uh I studied in part in nital
[120.56 - 125.68] partly in theun a little bit in Agra so
[122.24 - 127.36] it was all in all those places uh so
[125.68 - 129.36] quite a bit of uh you know un Pleasant
[127.36 - 130.72] experiences happened and uh someone told
[129.36 - 132.80] me that if you go and start lifting
[130.72 - 134.80] weights it'll probably help you bulk up
[132.80 - 136.20] uh because that's what happens and it'll
[134.80 - 137.88] maybe help you in what you want to
[136.20 - 139.68] achieve so what is the starting point in
[137.88 - 142.92] this lifting weights like it was on
[139.68 - 144.24] small dingy gym in the school or in the
[142.92 - 146.72] city or something like that yeah so it
[144.24 - 150.44] was a very small uh very small gym in
[146.72 - 153.88] the city in in derun and my my first
[150.44 - 155.92] experience at the gym was quite bad so I
[153.88 - 157.28] went I was very skinny I had a lot of
[155.92 - 160.08] experience in playing a sport but
[157.28 - 162.96] lifting weights nowhere close to uh
[160.08 - 165.52] doing that and in the first session uh
[162.96 - 166.80] the trainer pushed me quite hard and I
[165.52 - 168.40] couldn't I didn't know how to lift
[166.80 - 169.88] weights so I just couldn't do it very
[168.40 - 171.80] well and at the end of the session he
[169.88 - 175.24] told
[171.80 - 178.16] me it hurt my ego the next day I was so
[175.24 - 180.12] sore that I also got a fever I'm sensing
[178.16 - 184.04] I'm sensing you know if you go back in
[180.12 - 185.76] your time capsule this is where when you
[184.04 - 188.00] decided to start your fitness journey
[185.76 - 189.92] this thought was in your head don't over
[188.00 - 192.12] push people in their first workout
[189.92 - 194.56] exactly so this trainer over pushed you
[192.12 - 196.84] and then what happened then I was uh I
[194.56 - 198.52] just couldn't whatever he was asking me
[196.84 - 202.28] to do I couldn't do that much so he just
[198.52 - 205.76] told me this is not for you uh not in a
[202.28 - 207.52] very rude way it did hurt my ego uh went
[205.76 - 209.92] home wasn't very happy about it next day
[207.52 - 211.60] I got fever because of so excessive s
[209.92 - 213.32] Ness and excessive fatigue and then I
[211.60 - 216.24] thought maybe lifting weights is not for
[213.32 - 218.64] me done but then at some point later
[216.24 - 220.08] another 6 or 7 months or so my brother
[218.64 - 222.56] my younger brother who still works with
[220.08 - 224.84] me uh he told me just give it one more
[222.56 - 228.12] shot so there was another gym called
[224.84 - 231.28] Power Pack gym in in theun and we've
[228.12 - 233.88] walked into that gym uh it was 400 rupe
[231.28 - 236.24] a month of membership very expensive for
[233.88 - 238.56] me at that point uh then I thought Let
[236.24 - 240.32] It Be anyways this is not for me I've
[238.56 - 242.72] been told he said no let let's do it
[240.32 - 244.32] let's let's give it one more shot okay
[242.72 - 246.60] and then I started going to the gym the
[244.32 - 249.64] first day I walked in saw a bunch of
[246.60 - 252.36] bulky very muscular guys guys I was
[249.64 - 254.64] intimidated but then all of them were so
[252.36 - 256.48] helpful they taught me you know how to
[254.64 - 258.68] go about you were still about 14 15
[256.48 - 261.60] years of age I was still 14 14 years of
[258.68 - 263.16] age to be precise uh they were like very
[261.60 - 265.20] helpful they you know taught me the
[263.16 - 266.92] right kind of movements they also told
[265.20 - 269.16] me not to go crazy about it they told me
[266.92 - 271.40] a little bit about uh nutrition at that
[269.16 - 273.64] time I mean nutrition advices were just
[271.40 - 275.16] flowing uh a little all over the place
[273.64 - 277.36] but whatever they knew they were helping
[275.16 - 279.52] me out with it what I took away from it
[277.36 - 281.64] is just eat a lot of food so I did that
[279.52 - 284.60] I lifted weights and I started bulking
[281.64 - 286.32] up all of that happened uh and
[284.60 - 288.08] throughout so many years I've been
[286.32 - 289.16] through those journeys of gaining weight
[288.08 - 291.80] losing weight and all of that has
[289.16 - 294.36] happened with me but that is not
[291.80 - 297.04] important what is important is that
[294.36 - 299.16] weightlifting was something that came as
[297.04 - 300.68] magical to me actually a personal
[299.16 - 303.60] transformation
[300.68 - 305.96] experience not from the point of view of
[303.60 - 309.28] how I look but from the point of view of
[305.96 - 311.24] how I feel and then I decided that I'm
[309.28 - 313.52] never going back this is something hey
