so protection of course the minute you say protection people say SPF right because we are only thinking protecting from the Sun there's so much more to protect from but let's start from SPF so when you pick up sun protection is very important in the sunny hours whether you are indoor whether you're outdoor whether there's a cloud cover you need sun protection if the Sun is up and giving you light if there is day you need sunscreen so that's number one now how do you choose the sunscreen right you need to look at a number called SPF which is sun protection fact factor which means 1 SPF will give me 10 minutes of safety Under the Sun so if it is 50 SPF ideally I will get 50 into 10 500 minutes of safety now do I really get that maybe not because to get that there is a certain quantity of sunscreen that we need to apply which most of us don't so every third fourth hour you can reapply the sunscreen if you're really out in the sun if you're in the shade maybe not that many times again and again
