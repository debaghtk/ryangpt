[110.52 - 116.08] initiate the topic thank you good
[113.16 - 118.80] morning to all whenever I try to avoid
[116.08 - 120.68] that namkin at my friend's place during
[118.80 - 123.16] an evening at when I go go to her place
[120.68 - 123.16] I often
[124.60 - 130.76] said so as we see that unfortunately
[128.48 - 133.64] poor eating has become a norm and
[130.76 - 135.16] healthy eating is called dieting and we
[133.64 - 137.52] have already seen the result in the
[135.16 - 138.72] previous talk what has happened and
[137.52 - 139.84] where have we reached it's such an
[138.72 - 141.20] alarming situation about
[139.84 - 143.52] non-communicable
[141.20 - 146.28] diseases we need to remember that we are
[143.52 - 149.92] a country wherein food is called The
[146.28 - 152.96] Almighty himself paa Brahma and eating
[149.92 - 155.96] the act of eating is called yya karma
[152.96 - 159.52] the act of offering to the body and soul
[155.96 - 162.24] so we genuinely it's time that we make
[159.52 - 164.76] those trillions of bacteria in our gut
[162.24 - 167.80] let's put them to some good work not
[164.76 - 170.60] only to make this yya K Karma
[167.80 - 173.16] successful but also walk the talk that
[170.60 - 175.60] we do in our clinics and Enlighten our
[173.16 - 177.80] patients and help them stay away from
[175.60 - 181.16] the non-communicable diseases which are
[177.80 - 184.32] an epidemic today so I hand over the mic
[181.16 - 187.60] to Dr Ry for this talk to help us
[184.32 - 190.92] Enlighten on this topic thank you
[187.60 - 194.64] Doctor hi good afternoon
[190.92 - 196.80] everyone the first doctor lucky gave you
[194.64 - 199.36] a perception of how powerful your mind
[196.80 - 201.52] can be and you have to climb to Mount
[199.36 - 203.72] Everest let me tell you I'm going to be
[201.52 - 205.52] watching all your plates this afternoon
[203.72 - 207.44] at
[205.52 - 210.04] lunch and I'm going to be taking
[207.44 - 212.36] photographs on your plate to Mount
[210.04 - 214.92] Everest and then Dr Gita has actually
[212.36 - 219.12] made my session a little shorter because
[214.92 - 222.12] she said diet she kept saying diet and I
[219.12 - 224.40] would like to thank all the doctors over
[222.12 - 226.64] here for inviting me chiefly my
[224.40 - 228.84] classmate Dr
[226.64 - 231.52] vardan we played Cricket together in
[228.84 - 234.52] 11th standard I studied at Goa Medical
[231.52 - 238.56] College my clinical B yeah he hit a six
[234.52 - 240.40] off me so when when he called up my wife
[238.56 - 242.92] picked up the call the call at our
[240.40 - 244.44] clinic so I have about six clinics 75
[242.92 - 246.92] dietitians is called Quan nutrition
[244.44 - 250.12] clinics so she says there's this Von
[246.92 - 252.96] Doctor Who's called you from from um
[250.12 - 255.64] from the Goa I like and the first
[252.96 - 258.92] thought was nice hook shot hit me for a
[255.64 - 260.76] six that's my memory of him but I also
[258.92 - 263.40] have a memory of a very senior doctor
[260.76 - 265.36] that you may know and she in my opinion
[263.40 - 267.20] has made me a very rich nutritionist
[265.36 - 271.04] today Dr Shanti
[267.20 - 273.60] pomani so she was a head of H
[271.04 - 276.44] biochemistry I was the only boy among
[273.60 - 277.96] five of us in the Masters in clinical
[276.44 - 280.40] biochemistry I think the course is no
[277.96 - 282.60] longer conducted at Goa Medical College
[280.40 - 283.88] I think we were the second last batch
[282.60 - 286.32] and because of was the only boy she
[283.88 - 289.68] would keep me back send all the girls
[286.32 - 294.84] home and I would I would not I was like
[289.68 - 296.68] why me and U 30 years later I know why
[294.84 - 300.56] so I want to take a little bit of time
[296.68 - 304.24] to share with you two parts you the
[300.56 - 307.80] doctor the human being and you the
[304.24 - 310.68] doctor the creator of behavior in your
[307.80 - 313.24] patients I make a lot of money as a
[310.68 - 316.64] nutritionist because the doctors have
[313.24 - 319.36] not focused on diet as yet and I request
[316.64 - 321.60] you to begin to focus on that because
[319.36 - 323.16] you can charge an extra 3,000 rupees for
[321.60 - 325.68] a diet
[323.16 - 326.80] plan and that many places we have gone
[325.68 - 328.84] we've gone to Dubai and a business
[326.80 - 331.16] failed in Dubai and I'll say this
[328.84 - 332.80] publicly in a for him the doctor didn't
[331.16 - 335.68] like us charging more than what they
[332.80 - 338.08] were charging so there is a lot of
[335.68 - 341.16] potential to changing Behavior now why
[338.08 - 343.20] do people not listen because food is
[341.16 - 347.08] like Mount
[343.20 - 349.72] Everest Indians are Health loving no
[347.08 - 352.36] Health doing but the pandemic has
[349.72 - 354.64] changed this for all of us yeah I worked
[352.36 - 356.96] with a lot of celebrities Farin Khan's
[354.64 - 358.52] transformation has been the latest I
[356.96 - 361.72] don't know if you've seen Farin Khan go
[358.52 - 364.28] from 103 to to uh the weight he has
[361.72 - 366.16] at why do these people do it why do the
[364.28 - 369.08] sports Stars win it and why can't we
[366.16 - 371.52] common people not do it it's because
[369.08 - 373.52] anyone can do it because at the top of
[371.52 - 376.48] their Mount Everest they already have a
[373.52 - 378.76] paycheck of a few Crowes if somebody
[376.48 - 382.68] told you in this audience I would give
[378.76 - 385.76] you 1 CR rupees on December
[382.68 - 390.48] 2024 each one of you in this room as Dr
[385.76 - 392.28] Gita said lose 10 kgs and liver improves
[390.48 - 394.64] everything is in the diet as a clinical
[392.28 - 397.16] biochemist I can tell you we have
[394.64 - 400.88] reversed conditions so I'll start
[397.16 - 402.32] today's lecture for each one of you I
[400.88 - 404.32] don't want I don't want to know about
[402.32 - 407.04] the next patient that you receive but
[404.32 - 409.96] you as a doctor are extremely valuable
[407.04 - 412.48] if I was prime minister of India and you
[409.96 - 416.44] were all the generals in the Army the
[412.48 - 417.72] investment in you is very expensive the
[416.44 - 420.28] knowledge that you have is very
[417.72 - 422.20] expensive so I always ask people
[420.28 - 425.44] what vehicle do you
[422.20 - 428.16] drive right and I've seen doctors love
[425.44 - 431.36] to buy vehicles on the Comfort Dr
[428.16 - 434.24] dubashi is my upstairs neighbor his
[431.36 - 437.28] mother used to always tell us
[434.24 - 439.28] abas I didn't study much I became a
[437.28 - 441.52] nutritionist so I have huge reverence to
[439.28 - 444.20] doctors so he's telling me how he change
[441.52 - 447.56] different cars he says problem as I
[444.20 - 450.04] don't keep the car I sell it amazing
[447.56 - 451.76] philosophy amazing philosophy now ask
[450.04 - 454.08] you this question you would have changed
[451.76 - 457.20] what five six cars in your lifetime
[454.08 - 460.28] already can you change the human
[457.20 - 462.44] body you can't change the human body and
[460.28 - 464.04] therefore if you don't remember anything
[462.44 - 466.56] from today's lecture please leave this
[464.04 - 469.00] lecture with one thought your body is
[466.56 - 471.36] the most expensive real estate you will
[469.00 - 472.96] ever own you can change your house you
[471.36 - 476.48] can change your mobile you can change
[472.96 - 479.60] your laptop you can change your
[476.48 - 481.88] spouse you can change your spouse also
[479.60 - 483.52] you can't change your kid you can't
[481.88 - 486.00] change your parents and you can't change
[483.52 - 488.04] the human body this is my perspective to
[486.00 - 489.60] you take care of yourself first before
[488.04 - 492.12] you take care of your colleagues your
[489.60 - 494.84] hospital your patients how do we do
[492.12 - 497.32] this and look I know you all studied I
[494.84 - 499.28] studied first year mbbs with you all in
[497.32 - 501.32] the same thing nutrition was six
[499.28 - 503.32] lectures and I remember two three
[501.32 - 505.72] doctors coochie coing in the background
[503.32 - 508.88] and stuff like that but the perspective
[505.72 - 512.20] here is nutrition is becoming massively
[508.88 - 514.24] s ific and the second takeaway for you
[512.20 - 517.04] today is the bio
[514.24 - 520.88] individuality I Nam my clinic Quan
[517.04 - 524.28] nutrition Quan Latin means
[520.88 - 526.40] incapacity it means when I drink orange
[524.28 - 530.32] juice and if you drink orange juice with
[526.40 - 531.56] a CGM device because of my microbiome
[530.32 - 534.32] there is a
[531.56 - 537.24] different sugar Spike there is a g
[534.32 - 541.28] difference glycemic response which means
[537.24 - 544.84] the orange has a said glycemic index but
[541.28 - 547.44] my genetics my genetics and my
[544.84 - 549.56] microbiome bring about that biod
[547.44 - 551.72] bio-individuality so I challenge
[549.56 - 554.76] scientific studies because the
[551.72 - 557.28] population subset is for a group of
[554.76 - 561.04] people that may not agree with Shah ruk
[557.28 - 563.28] Khan Amir Khan Ryan Fernando Dr vardan
[561.04 - 567.04] or Dr Vishal or any of you doctors out
[563.28 - 569.36] here you're bio individual and hence a
[567.04 - 572.88] little bit more time to understanding
[569.36 - 575.96] your patients your patient or you for
[572.88 - 577.36] example fat cells reside in your body
[575.96 - 581.64] for 8
[577.36 - 584.92] years 8 years RBC is for 4
[581.64 - 588.00] months so when you try to change
[584.92 - 591.04] behavior in patients what Behavior
[588.00 - 593.64] exercise behavior and diet Behavior
[591.04 - 595.40] unfortunately a Prescription Pad will
[593.64 - 599.24] not
[595.40 - 601.16] work if it worked you'd be prescribing
[599.24 - 603.48] diet left right and center now why
[601.16 - 606.76] doesn't it work what's the logical
[603.48 - 609.92] thought next it's because
[606.76 - 611.08] 99.99% of the planet doesn't climb up to
[609.92 - 613.80] Mount
[611.08 - 615.36] Everest and the biggest Tempest on the
[613.80 - 617.64] planet is
[615.36 - 620.52] your taste
[617.64 - 623.44] buds the biggest Tempest on the planet
[620.52 - 627.56] is your taste buds and finally all of us
[623.44 - 631.40] eat out of love and culture I came home
[627.56 - 633.40] I refuse to eat at home to nutritionist
[631.40 - 635.48] you can't eat bread all your life you
[633.40 - 637.40] are a Pala you ate bread at breakfast
[635.48 - 640.84] lunch dinner I've written a book called
[637.40 - 642.88] weakless because I did my DNA test my
[640.84 - 645.12] nutrigenomics has told me I'm gluten
[642.88 - 648.28] intolerant and lactose intolerant at the
[645.12 - 650.32] age of 34 I found out this after years
[648.28 - 652.76] of producing claricy in my body
[650.32 - 654.40] producing applying it and producing it
[652.76 - 656.96] nothing happened my adult acne you can
[654.40 - 659.44] still see it on my face
[656.96 - 661.36] scarred what was the thought process are
[659.44 - 663.88] Baba bread doesn't agree with you no but
[661.36 - 666.08] you're born in Goa no hello but my
[663.88 - 669.00] father's tamilan and then when I did the
[666.08 - 672.56] ancestry Gene get this I have 9%
[669.00 - 674.60] Rajasthani Gene I have 177% Telugu Gene
[672.56 - 675.83] God knows which grandfather banged which
[674.60 - 678.94] grandmother
[675.83 - 678.94] [Music]
[679.44 - 685.92] where so this thing that I am culturally
[682.40 - 688.20] firm Goa was I may have learned here for
[685.92 - 691.72] the last decad so Dr Gita made this
[688.20 - 695.04] point you eat local I would enhance that
[691.72 - 697.12] point a little further nutriomics the
[695.04 - 699.04] science of genes is clearly coming out
[697.12 - 701.56] data the only problem that you can shoot
[699.04 - 704.20] me on is it's a lot of Caucasian based
[701.56 - 706.16] data I am awaiting the genetic research
[704.20 - 708.52] over the next decade that comes out of
[706.16 - 712.36] this population subset and that's where
[708.52 - 712.36] you will begin to start telling your
[712.40 - 717.44] patients what not what to eat just how
[715.80 - 719.52] much to eat and timing you have three
[717.44 - 722.68] components doctors
[719.52 - 726.64] just work on portion control and work on
[722.68 - 728.12] timing because what to eat orange juice
[726.64 - 729.68] works for him orange juice doesn't work
[728.12 - 731.92] for me that's going to be where you do
[729.68 - 735.64] the diagnostic so why I talked about
[731.92 - 737.16] this is I I see doctors eating and I do
[735.64 - 738.56] a lot of lectures in hospitals where I
[737.16 - 740.80] go spend two three days in different
[738.56 - 742.20] hospitals around the world they invite
[740.80 - 746.60] me and I interact with the different
[742.20 - 748.56] departments and all the uh the cafeteria
[746.60 - 751.68] is a place where you can observe uh
[748.56 - 753.76] doctor behaviors towards diet and there
[751.68 - 755.20] are some doctors today and you will
[753.76 - 756.56] laugh but you'll remember there one or
[755.20 - 758.40] two doctors they carry their own tiffen
[756.56 - 761.76] box to the
[758.40 - 764.52] hospital bio individual bio individual
[761.76 - 767.08] I'm glad you're carrying your tiffen box
[764.52 - 769.40] so when you are carrying your own tiffen
[767.08 - 771.72] box you are treating your body as a
[769.40 - 773.48] landlord you are landlord in your own
[771.72 - 776.08] body you are not a
[773.48 - 779.80] tenant so this is very very important
[776.08 - 781.92] okay uh and I've done thousands Quan
[779.80 - 783.80] nutrition has been around since 2010 the
[781.92 - 785.24] pandemic has changed our fortunes
[783.80 - 787.28] because people understood hey I've got
[785.24 - 791.36] two cars two houses two bunglow two
[787.28 - 793.28] Mistresses all of that stuff but I can't
[791.36 - 796.60] use any of this wealth if my health is
[793.28 - 801.64] not good this is Mr Vishnu Pai with with
[796.60 - 803.08] approval from him he was a 72y old 10.3
[801.64 - 808.08] glycemic
[803.08 - 810.12] hb1c okay insulin amputated toe came to
[808.08 - 811.84] me for a nutrition plan his son was
[810.12 - 813.68] doing workout and everything with me and
[811.84 - 815.80] said he told his father why don't you go
[813.68 - 817.96] the older people are very resistant
[815.80 - 820.64] after 40 your mind gets into this
[817.96 - 824.00] concrete mindset you know everything
[820.64 - 826.76] okay some doctors are
[824.00 - 830.08] laughing we just worked on body
[826.76 - 833.40] composition walking and changed his diet
[830.08 - 835.00] genetically he lost 11 years in his body
[833.40 - 838.20] age I'll give you the weighing scale
[835.00 - 840.16] that I feel every doctor in this room
[838.20 - 843.04] should have in their Clinic not a

[928.64 - 932.64] streams and revenues I have medical

[932.64 - 935.92] you can get in touch with me I'll give
[933.96 - 938.64] you my number at the end of presentation
[935.92 - 941.48] but Dr Gita made very valuable points on
[938.64 - 943.24] diet weight loss exercise so I'm not
[941.48 - 945.92] going to bore you guys because you know
[943.24 - 948.40] about this but what I'd like to share
[945.92 - 952.00] with you is my own personal experience
[948.40 - 954.08] on magnesium I play a lot of um I do a
[952.00 - 956.40] lot of physical activity every day one
[954.08 - 959.28] one and a half hour every day T the
[956.40 - 960.76] miniscus at age of 48 done all of that
[959.28 - 963.56] my wife keeps telling what's wrong with
[960.76 - 967.24] you but it's a point to try and prove
[963.56 - 969.96] that the human body can still become
[967.24 - 973.00] younger and then there was this study in
[969.96 - 975.16] America which I read one half of the uh
[973.00 - 977.88] group was 72 years old so imagine all of
[975.16 - 978.76] you are 72 imagine all of you are 72
[977.88 - 981.28] this
[978.76 - 983.84] side this group was in an old age home
[981.28 - 985.56] they put Bingo Ludo je all of those
[983.84 - 987.52] games and all in the basement for the
[985.56 - 989.16] old age people to play this group they
[987.52 - 990.72] put a gym in the basement
[989.16 - 993.44] this group started
[990.72 - 995.32] complaining we 72 we retired what they
[993.44 - 997.32] want us to work out and all they did a
[995.32 - 999.48] biopsy on the quadricep muscle 6 months
[997.32 - 1004.04] later they found that the muscle
[999.48 - 1005.60] regressed in age by 6 years so if
[1004.04 - 1008.84] there's one thing that I would give you
[1005.60 - 1012.72] as a gift today especially the women
[1008.84 - 1019.00] doctors hire a personal trainer and wait
[1012.72 - 1021.20] train don't run wait train walk yoga
[1019.00 - 1024.20] you need strength as you get older and
[1021.20 - 1027.08] muscle is the only age reversible organ
[1024.20 - 1029.28] this if you can start doing or leading
[1027.08 - 1031.12] your community as a doctor in we
[1029.28 - 1033.00] training people will start following you
[1031.12 - 1035.44] it's a change of momentum that we need
[1033.00 - 1037.24] in society which now our current
[1035.44 - 1039.72] generation as doctors you're beginning
[1037.24 - 1040.68] to realize so just Advocate that a
[1039.72 - 1042.96] little bit
[1040.68 - 1046.08] further it's it's lovely that we can do
[1042.96 - 1048.76] different things a lot of My Success is
[1046.08 - 1051.32] because of the ability to link blood
[1048.76 - 1053.92] test by the way the entire presentation
[1051.32 - 1056.12] is available at free download I will
[1053.92 - 1057.52] give you a QR code at the end just scan
[1056.12 - 1059.08] it it will take you straight to the
[1057.52 - 1060.36] presentation you can download it to your
[1059.08 - 1062.92] phone so you'll get the whole
[1060.36 - 1065.44] presentation if you wish so I worked
[1062.92 - 1067.72] with many film stars I'll give you quick
[1065.44 - 1069.80] quick tips very very quickly okay
[1067.72 - 1072.96] glutathione you all know glutathion
[1069.80 - 1076.92] liver glutathion peroxide super it is
[1072.96 - 1079.20] basically the aishwara r system in your
[1076.92 - 1082.08] body I also want to be
[1079.20 - 1085.92] missor right
[1082.08 - 1089.80] glutathione is found in this plant that
[1085.92 - 1092.20] will grow in most of our Gardens in Goa
[1089.80 - 1094.08] percan take this and I'll teach you a
[1092.20 - 1095.96] simple tricker there's something called
[1094.08 - 1098.24] Google Lens doctors have you heard of
[1095.96 - 1100.20] Google Lens when you go to Google search
[1098.24 - 1103.00] on the side there'll be one camera click
[1100.20 - 1104.76] that camera point it at a herb Google
[1103.00 - 1106.16] will tell you what's the herb then you
[1104.76 - 1108.56] research the herb you'll find out it
[1106.16 - 1109.80] grows in your garden I grow this on my
[1108.56 - 1112.76] Terrace in
[1109.80 - 1117.08] Bangalore and I have it once or twice a
[1112.76 - 1119.08] week doctor what about uh uh glutathione
[1117.08 - 1120.76] as a nutritional supplement in coid time
[1119.08 - 1123.56] you would have read the research papers
[1120.76 - 1125.80] High dosing of glutathione helped right
[1123.56 - 1127.64] but glutathione absorption by your gut
[1125.80 - 1129.24] hey your gut is super good my gut is not
[1127.64 - 1130.76] so good so you might absorb 300
[1129.24 - 1133.52] milligrams I might absorb only 2
[1130.76 - 1136.76] milligrams so the next stage is what I
[1133.52 - 1140.16] feel is the new designer business for
[1136.76 - 1143.12] doctors infusion inions nutritional
[1140.16 - 1145.32] infusions and that is what all the film
[1143.12 - 1148.20] stars and Jeff Bezos and all are doing
[1145.32 - 1150.00] globally so I'm just thinking what
[1148.20 - 1153.00] medications you prescribe to clients
[1150.00 - 1154.60] today came in the ' 70s 80s and '90s and
[1153.00 - 1156.40] now the advancements are then that's
[1154.60 - 1158.72] becoming mainstream I believe
[1156.40 - 1161.36] nutritional infusions could be something
[1158.72 - 1164.76] so doctors try it out glutathion is an
[1161.36 - 1167.80] infusion you get younger
[1164.76 - 1170.60] spirulina it is been hidden by the
[1167.80 - 1173.96] farmer industry but if spirina agrees
[1170.60 - 1176.16] with your gut 500 to 4 G 5 G A Day
[1173.96 - 1178.36] smells like Nala water so I take
[1176.16 - 1180.08] capsules okay it's blue green algae
[1178.36 - 1183.12] works really really well by the way I
[1180.08 - 1184.84] use this on all of my clients okay uh
[1183.12 - 1187.44] and what I've done is I've given you the
[1184.84 - 1189.64] scientific studies for each one of them
[1187.44 - 1191.64] so like how kumin now all of you know
[1189.64 - 1193.84] about kumin you know about HDI I
[1191.64 - 1196.24] remember in Co I designed before the
[1193.84 - 1197.96] vaccination came out I designed one
[1196.24 - 1199.24] because I just read a paper which says
[1197.96 - 1201.84] that
[1199.24 - 1206.28] uh curcumin at a certain level in a
[1201.84 - 1207.84] Petri dish broke the prongs of the cold
[1206.28 - 1210.40] virus in
[1207.84 - 1213.08] replication so virus is a
[1210.40 - 1217.08] virus I think we suffered lesser because
[1213.08 - 1220.80] most of our food had hthy in it right so
[1217.08 - 1224.00] food for thought if food can be
[1220.80 - 1226.40] medicine Why not start adding that as
[1224.00 - 1228.76] part of your prescription Prat could
[1226.40 - 1232.48] your patient have a coconut water with
[1228.76 - 1233.88] qu teaspoon of termeric in it the
[1232.48 - 1236.04] patients you will understand and You'
[1233.88 - 1238.08] have been experiencing this like Dr Gita
[1236.04 - 1239.48] said no the patients ask me tell me
[1238.08 - 1241.84] doctor I'll write down right now what I
[1239.48 - 1244.56] need to eat three four tips on Good
[1241.84 - 1246.68] Foods as selectors you can't change the
[1244.56 - 1248.16] diet of a person you need a dietitian
[1246.68 - 1250.56] you need a nutritionist they need to
[1248.16 - 1252.56] keep going to that person back again to
[1250.56 - 1255.08] change yearlong
[1252.56 - 1256.68] Behavior even if I have to change any
[1255.08 - 1259.12] doctor's Behavior many doctors come to
[1256.68 - 1260.92] me for diet plan I'm like dude you have
[1259.12 - 1263.60] to work with me for six
[1260.92 - 1265.32] months if I give you a blueprint it's
[1263.60 - 1267.44] not that you can't follow the blueprint
[1265.32 - 1269.52] it's a segment of habit which is why
[1267.44 - 1271.64] diet will be the most difficult thing to
[1269.52 - 1273.28] change because of people's taste
[1271.64 - 1275.88] buds
[1273.28 - 1278.56] asanin huge amount of research in
[1275.88 - 1280.44] anti-aging huge amount of research in
[1278.56 - 1282.68] cancer uh it's available as a
[1280.44 - 1284.80] nutritional supplement 4
[1282.68 - 1287.08] milligrams I can actually write down a
[1284.80 - 1289.28] whole thing that you can do as a doctor
[1287.08 - 1291.28] do it for one year take photographs of
[1289.28 - 1293.32] your skin take photographs of your body
[1291.28 - 1296.08] composition and we can actually do our
[1293.32 - 1298.84] age reversal of your own self very very
[1296.08 - 1301.36] possible collagen is number one
[1298.84 - 1303.60] especially for the women six weeks of
[1301.36 - 1306.40] collagen now people will say type one
[1303.60 - 1308.52] type two type 3 collagen listen we don't
[1306.40 - 1311.60] absorb collagen we absorb the amino
[1308.52 - 1313.92] acids the pool of amino acids in in
[1311.60 - 1315.52] collagen and the pool of amino acids in
[1313.92 - 1319.36] whe protein or the pool of amino acids
[1315.52 - 1321.96] in mutton is different what what is
[1319.36 - 1324.72] happening is people are not dietary
[1321.96 - 1328.52] disciplined to eat the quantity that
[1324.72 - 1331.32] they require till today medicine is a
[1328.52 - 1333.40] very scientific topic you have a disease
[1331.32 - 1335.76] you have a diagnosis you have a
[1333.40 - 1337.32] medication you have a therapeutic dozing
[1335.76 - 1339.84] and you know the period of time for to
[1337.32 - 1343.36] get the outcome of that result diet is
[1339.84 - 1345.20] not like that because of the genetics
[1343.36 - 1347.16] because of the behavioral impact of a
[1345.20 - 1348.72] client being disciplined to the dozing
[1347.16 - 1352.48] of food as a medicine
[1348.72 - 1353.80] but for me collagen amazing on skin and
[1352.48 - 1356.64] I'm saying this to all the women in the
[1353.80 - 1359.72] organization fine line wrinkles fine
[1356.64 - 1363.12] line wrinkles reduced by up to
[1359.72 - 1365.56] 67% in 6 weeks on dozing with collagen
[1363.12 - 1367.52] bone broth soup somebody mentioned
[1365.56 - 1371.16] Portuguese culture earlier when we were
[1367.52 - 1373.28] there bone Brad soup is huge in uh
[1371.16 - 1375.08] European culture in the mediterian diet
[1373.28 - 1378.12] use that for your soft tissue joints
[1375.08 - 1380.20] ligaments skin all of that amla there
[1378.12 - 1384.60] was a research paper
[1380.20 - 1389.96] triglycerides uh LDL and
[1384.60 - 1392.32] um vdl was reduced by 15 basis points on
[1389.96 - 1394.72] two amas every morning in a group of
[1392.32 - 1396.76] about 700 I've I've linked this study
[1394.72 - 1400.80] over here I've actually put the study
[1396.76 - 1404.48] over here uh and so on uh heart markers
[1400.80 - 1407.56] amla really works I hate amla so what I
[1404.48 - 1409.64] do organic amla powder I buy organic
[1407.56 - 1411.56] amla powder I toss it every morning
[1409.64 - 1413.52] first thing into my mouth and then wash
[1411.56 - 1416.40] it down with water that's there so
[1413.52 - 1417.64] that's my Statin reducer to keep my
[1416.40 - 1419.80] cholesterol low I'm not saying that
[1417.64 - 1422.84] somebody has high cholesterol can do it
[1419.80 - 1426.00] but could you do medical prescription
[1422.84 - 1427.36] and purposely give a diet prescription
[1426.00 - 1429.08] cuz I'll tell you what patients do when
[1427.36 - 1430.44] they come to us and I want to stop my
[1429.08 - 1431.92] medication I'm like you can't do that go
[1430.44 - 1433.92] back to your doctor they hate me for
[1431.92 - 1435.28] sending me back to the doctor to reduce
[1433.92 - 1437.20] the dosage because we're doing before
[1435.28 - 1438.44] and after no no I don't want to go back
[1437.20 - 1440.60] to the doctor he'll not not a reducer
[1438.44 - 1442.64] dose I said but he's the boss he will
[1440.60 - 1444.60] tell you whether it's safe to stop
[1442.64 - 1447.00] taking the medication or not so if you
[1444.60 - 1450.80] start adding a few Foods over there
[1447.00 - 1452.92] almonds boost uh HDL baked beans all all
[1450.80 - 1455.40] our legumes and beans change the
[1452.92 - 1458.16] microbiome mark my words you will start
[1455.40 - 1460.24] reading research papers that come out
[1458.16 - 1462.64] which will be changing all of this okay
[1460.24 - 1467.04] there's selenium Brazil nut very
[1462.64 - 1470.00] good okay fasting is amazing fasting is
[1467.04 - 1473.24] amazing the latest the research that is

[1486.44 - 1491.48] a 30-hour fast very simple you finish
[1488.76 - 1493.20] eating today at 5:00 in the evening then
[1491.48 - 1495.32] distract yourself till you go to sleep
[1493.20 - 1496.52] with everything except food don't
[1495.32 - 1498.44] surround yourself with your friends
[1496.52 - 1501.88] because they say come let's go eat

[1520.52 - 1524.68] months of fasting once or twice a week
[1523.08 - 1526.68] does it improve your lipid profile and
[1524.68 - 1528.72] does it drop your body fat
[1526.68 - 1530.52] percentage
[1528.72 - 1531.76] the reason it does but I tell people
[1530.52 - 1533.56] practice it because a lot of people say
[1531.76 - 1536.92] no I don't think it
[1533.56 - 1538.68] works um the problem for all vegetarian
[1536.92 - 1541.00] people is collagen is bone broth I
[1538.68 - 1542.92] forgot this so there's a way to make veg
[1541.00 - 1544.68] collagen by putting these fruits

[1570.24 - 1575.08] plate that is not linked to phyton
[1573.08 - 1576.72] nutrition which is the vegetables or the
[1575.08 - 1579.32] fruits and that's what Dr Gita said in
[1576.72 - 1581.04] the first session simple doctors reduce
[1579.32 - 1583.24] your carbohydrate so you're putting rice
[1581.04 - 1586.24] in your plate put a teaspoon lesser
[1583.24 - 1588.60] today makes sidat Goa Sweat by finishing
[1586.24 - 1589.76] off all the vegetables
[1588.60 - 1591.16] they'll be like are yeah this is the
[1589.76 - 1592.32] first conference the chicken didn't go
[1591.16 - 1594.44] and the mutton didn't go and the fish
[1592.32 - 1597.88] didn't go but the vegetables
[1594.44 - 1600.28] went okay this is my secret in my clinic
[1597.88 - 1602.96] I do the Omega
[1600.28 - 1605.56] test uh it's an Omega blood test to
[1602.96 - 1607.88] check the levels of Omega 6 to omega3 to
[1605.56 - 1611.80] then determine the change of oils in the
[1607.88 - 1614.12] diet in mothers we do testing of DHA in
[1611.80 - 1616.28] the breast milk I do the microbiome
[1614.12 - 1618.36] testing poop analysis you know
[1616.28 - 1621.56] rheumatoid arthritis is latest is linked
[1618.36 - 1623.64] to uh a causitive factor in the
[1621.56 - 1625.60] microbiome so we have slowly
[1623.64 - 1627.88] experimenting in our clinic in changing
[1625.60 - 1630.52] the diet factor and we're seeing ra
[1627.88 - 1632.32] Factor actually dropping so it will be
[1630.52 - 1634.48] wonderful for those of you who have your
[1632.32 - 1636.48] own hospitals or clinic hire two three
[1634.48 - 1639.00] dietician tell them your only
[1636.48 - 1641.24] job is to keep talking to the patient
[1639.00 - 1643.56] and this is the diet I want and put your
[1641.24 - 1646.16] patients on 90 days of therapeutic diet
[1643.56 - 1648.64] day 1 day 45 day 90 you will see
[1646.16 - 1650.32] fantastic results coming downwards so
[1648.64 - 1652.72] suddenly you develop a protocol that's
[1650.32 - 1654.28] to your name start disseminating that to
[1652.72 - 1656.28] patients out then the patient will be
[1654.28 - 1658.44] like this is worked what next then go
[1656.28 - 1659.72] into diagnostic testing with patients do
[1658.44 - 1661.48] you want to do your genetic testing do
[1659.72 - 1663.04] you want to do your microbiome testing
[1661.48 - 1665.20] right now they expensive the microbiome
[1663.04 - 1667.16] is about 20 grand and the genetic test
[1665.20 - 1669.64] for the nutrition one is about 15 grand
[1667.16 - 1671.56] or so so it is still not in the reach of
[1669.64 - 1674.00] the Common Man but I expect with
[1671.56 - 1675.68] Reliance investing in genetic companies
[1674.00 - 1678.32] and microbiome companies we will get it
[1675.68 - 1680.44] at 2 to 5,000 rupees by 20
[1678.32 - 1682.28] 2025 this is the weighing skill I want
[1680.44 - 1683.92] you to buy I have no commercial
[1682.28 - 1687.08] Allegiance but I have been using it for
[1683.92 - 1691.60] a decade it's the Omron karada
[1687.08 - 1692.96] hbf uh hbf 965 so again I'm sending this
[1691.60 - 1695.32] presentation to you now why you should
[1692.96 - 1697.92] have this Wing scale it gives you fat
[1695.32 - 1699.84] percentage and muscle percentage
[1697.92 - 1703.72] visceral fat which doctor talked about
[1699.84 - 1705.44] in the previous B all the fat um sits on
[1703.72 - 1708.36] top of the organs the heart the liver
[1705.44 - 1710.96] the kidney everything so what happens is
[1708.36 - 1713.40] it's a non-invasive diagnostic
[1710.96 - 1714.88] tool so all these patients that come
[1713.40 - 1716.68] into your clinic you look at them you
[1714.88 - 1718.24] already know they are fat you know they
[1716.68 - 1719.52] have a problem because they are fat you
[1718.24 - 1721.36] know they have a problem because they
[1719.52 - 1725.12] can't close their
[1721.36 - 1725.12] mouth so one day somebody
[1729.96 - 1735.52] came people do not are not there are
[1732.76 - 1737.20] three genes overeating Gene snacking
[1735.52 - 1739.40] Gene and emotional eating I do that in
[1737.20 - 1740.76] my clinic and then people confess yeah
[1739.40 - 1742.64] you know what when I'm very stressed out
[1740.76 - 1745.24] I'm an emotional eater I have got the
[1742.64 - 1747.36] snacking Gene 9:00 in the evening I am
[1745.24 - 1748.52] there uh my wife's like what are you
[1747.36 - 1750.04] doing looking in the fridge and talking
[1748.52 - 1751.84] into the fridge nobody in the kitchen
[1750.04 - 1753.76] nobody in the house I'm talking to the
[1751.84 - 1755.68] fridge I don't know how many of you do
[1753.76 - 1758.72] this but it's a snacking Gene it's
[1755.68 - 1760.80] Evolution that made me to move from
[1758.72 - 1762.60] continent to continent and keep
[1760.80 - 1766.76] snacking I
[1762.60 - 1770.40] think okay this is a this is a gold mine
[1766.76 - 1773.52] of a of a book it is 600 Pages
[1770.40 - 1777.36] personally compiled by me and my team of
[1773.52 - 1780.04] 89 foods with their scientific study on
[1777.36 - 1782.52] how these foods are actually drugs and
[1780.04 - 1785.60] the dozing in them I can't present this
[1782.52 - 1787.56] it's too long but that's the QR code
[1785.60 - 1789.44] it's a flip book on a public domain
[1787.56 - 1792.00] website I believe in Sharing knowledge
[1789.44 - 1794.20] my team put it together so simple things
[1792.00 - 1798.32] like I learned that
[1794.20 - 1801.28] pomegranate contains beta sta stero
[1798.32 - 1804.16] which in a onee study where the
[1801.28 - 1806.40] participants had a full glass of
[1804.16 - 1808.64] pomegranate juice with the seeds now
[1806.40 - 1810.76] diabetic remove the juice and take out
[1808.64 - 1814.08] only the seeds blend the seeds and eat
[1810.76 - 1816.80] the seeds the cared intermedia thickness
[1814.08 - 1821.44] went down by
[1816.80 - 1824.12] 36% so for me reversal is at that level
[1821.44 - 1827.68] so please find the time if you can to
[1824.12 - 1830.08] get this and I think this is yeah this
[1827.68 - 1831.76] is the scan for the entire presentation
[1830.08 - 1834.36] so if you take the QR code of this scan
[1831.76 - 1834.36] I'll get out of the
[1834.52 - 1839.16] way or you just take the mobile number
[1837.12 - 1841.04] and you will get a wonderful lady at a
[1839.16 - 1842.56] clinic by the name of DVA just say I
[1841.04 - 1845.88] played Cricket with Ryan and I hit him
[1842.56 - 1845.88] for a six I will call you
[1848.60 - 1852.92] back I'll keep I'll keep it up over here
[1851.32 - 1855.40] and that's me and my presentation so if
[1852.92 - 1855.40] I can just
[1856.24 - 1861.60] summarize I can do 25 hours with you on
[1859.92 - 1863.12] nutrition and convince you that
[1861.60 - 1866.08] Nutrition Works on yourself and your
[1863.12 - 1869.48] patients the simplest thing is you start
[1866.08 - 1872.36] working on yourself first uh the the
[1869.48 - 1874.68] magical thing is to walk not run get the
[1872.36 - 1877.20] wing scale to check your visceral fat
[1874.68 - 1879.56] and your body age and you can reduce
[1877.20 - 1882.52] your body age by at least a decade in
[1879.56 - 1885.60] one year of hardcore eating eating
[1882.52 - 1888.32] properly exercising properly third is
[1885.60 - 1891.00] begin to start writing descriptions of
[1888.32 - 1892.88] portion control to your client and
[1891.00 - 1895.76] timing to your client try and add
[1892.88 - 1897.96] fasting in there so if they religious
[1895.76 - 1900.64] ask them which day of the week do you
[1897.96 - 1902.72] believe Vishnu Shiva Brahma or if you're
[1900.64 - 1904.28] a Muslim you know Raman through the day
[1902.72 - 1906.24] or if you're Christian like us my
[1904.28 - 1908.60] grandmother fasted on
[1906.24 - 1911.52] Fridays but we don't do it anymore why
[1908.60 - 1913.40] Friday Good Friday now we like I am like
[1911.52 - 1915.84] lazy so I have to scientifically
[1913.40 - 1917.68] convince myself to fast so write a
[1915.84 - 1919.04] prescription where for from a religious
[1917.68 - 1921.80] point of view like you know which is
[1919.04 - 1925.56] your holy day and do that 24 hours what
[1921.80 - 1927.60] to eat just say green tea water and
[1925.56 - 1930.24] maximum if your patients are on anti
[1927.60 - 1934.84] acids and all of that stuff
[1930.24 - 1937.36] cucumber final Point look at nutritional
[1934.84 - 1939.20] supplements from a deficiency point of
[1937.36 - 1940.92] view asking for vitamins and minerals I
[1939.20 - 1943.56] think the key cause for lifestyle
[1940.92 - 1945.64] diseases is the what is do what is the
[1943.56 - 1947.60] word that doctor used one was
[1945.64 - 1950.76] malnutrition and the other one was was
[1947.60 - 1952.32] um over nutrition right so the over
[1950.76 - 1954.28] nutrition but there's still malnutrition
[1952.32 - 1956.92] for vitamins and minerals so I'll hand
[1954.28 - 1958.16] over to my colleague Dr Sachin and if
[1956.92 - 1960.04] you have any questions I'm going to be
[1958.16 - 1962.68] here the whole day and I will be
[1960.04 - 1962.68] watching your
[1967.16 - 1972.64] plate thank you Ryan for a wonderful
[1969.96 - 1974.92] presentation uh uh I'll just say three
[1972.64 - 1977.72] points a visibly unfit doctor
[1974.92 - 1979.88] prescribing Fitness or health to a
[1977.72 - 1980.80] patient is an oxymoron nobody's going to
[1979.88 - 1983.12] take you
[1980.80 - 1986.12] seriously second a lot of data is
[1983.12 - 1989.20] available which is written by non doctor
[1986.12 - 1990.92] so we need to get out of our you know
[1989.20 - 1992.84] that we live in a very small world where
[1990.92 - 1994.48] we think that doctors know it all that's
[1992.84 - 1996.64] not a fact we need to get that
[1994.48 - 1998.16] information not available in any medical
[1996.64 - 1999.76] textbook but there's a lot of alternate
[1998.16 - 2001.00] literature you got to figure it out you
[1999.76 - 2002.88] got to read it out and make those
[2001.00 - 2004.48] changes third thing which I would
[2002.88 - 2006.36] request everybody is start looking at
[2004.48 - 2009.72] food labels teach your children to read
[2006.36 - 2009.72] food labels that's a way
[2011.83 - 2016.80] [Music]
[2013.80 - 2016.80] ahead
