[0.28 - 6.04] I eat early dinner and I think it's
[2.60 - 8.68] doing wonders to my health by 5:30 6
[6.04 - 10.60] dinner's done but I feel like I rest
[8.68 - 13.44] better I sleep better all my sleep
[10.60 - 16.56] issues are gone I wake up fresher I have
[13.44 - 18.28] more energy I think clearer I would
[16.56 - 19.72] attribute that to eating early because
[18.28 - 22.36] that's the only change really that I've
[19.72 - 25.56] made in my life look at her schedule
[22.36 - 27.80] she's finishing eating by 5 to 6:00 p.m.
[25.56 - 30.00] there is a research why you should eat
[27.80 - 32.12] earlier your circadian rhythm gets
[30.00 - 34.36] better now if you can't finish at 6:00
[32.12 - 37.64] in the evening try and finish it by 7:00
[34.36 - 39.72] in the evening it allows 3 hours of
[37.64 - 42.08] digestion of food before you hit the bed
[39.72 - 44.76] by 10:00 at night so your liver is
[42.08 - 48.24] getting a chance to detoxify and did you
[44.76 - 50.52] know that deep sine wave sleep is better
[48.24 - 53.20] when you have eaten earlier in the
[50.52 - 55.88] evening so my former client followed
[53.20 - 57.92] these steps of eating early and going to
[55.88 - 61.80] bed early to get a better weight
[57.92 - 61.80] management and a better skin glow
