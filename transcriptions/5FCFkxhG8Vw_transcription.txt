Transcript: nobody will die from intermittent fasting the human race is eating too much and if you're doing the intermittent [Music] fasting a recent study revealed that people who followed intermittent fasting were 91% more likely to have died from cardiovascular disease than those who did not practice intermittent fasting news flash this is why I feel a study like this promotes Ed in the Indian media is wrong for our 1.3 billion population do not listen to this advice here's my take you see the intermittent fasting I got my team to pull out the study I first thought it was a peer-reviewed study but I came to know it's a poster paper submitted now this was done on 20,000 people it was the Caucasian or the white race and some black people this is by this is not Indian audience first point okay second point is the people that died were from cardiovascular and cancer which means they already had it here's my take India number one when do you do intermittent fasting you do intermittent fasting when your doctor has told you by up overweight you are more than 24.6 BMI so what do you do you have to cut down on your eating when you cut down on your eating there are two strategies one is reduce the portion or reduce the eating window in this study they finding of that people who ate in an 8h hour window but you start eating at say 12:00 in the afternoon and finish eating by 8:00 in the evening that's an 8 Hour window such people had a 91% more risk of cardiovascular disease now this is my take one when you do intermittent fasting you are constructing the diet on your own you are not going to your medical doctor and doing the blood test which blood test you have to do the cholesterol the lipoprotein A lipoprotein B homosysteine C reactive protein and the size of your cholesterol particles in addition to this your good doctor your metabolic doctor your cardiovascular doctor your endocrinologist will also ask you to do an heart checkup which is the ECG the 2D Doppler and the calcium CT score now once you do this then they will clear you for exercise and diet but then you try and do the diet on your own it's not a medical nutritionist helping you so your protein carbs and fats and more specifically the antioxidants which protect you against damage cellular damage inside your body also I've seen when people do intermittent fasting they forget to drink water did you know that there was a study done on alkaline water which says it reduced the viscosity and platelet aggregation by 2% when you're doing intermittent fasting a lot of people forget to drink water hydrate well so your blood becomes more jarada more thicker so chances of a cardiovascular incidence are higher and again I go back to my previous Point people who are heavier in weight have diabetes problem have hypertension problem or are on the cusp of getting these problems so doctor tells you to lose weight because he's looked at your blood test because you have BP marker or cholesterol marker or sugar marker so it's kind of you're in a cycle and food for thought if you not done this with a nutritionist if you not done it with a certified te I see a lot of people yesterday there were two gentlemen in the gym they were working out like crazy they are doing the intermittent fasting have you gone to a medical nutritionist no do you have cholesterol problem yes are you doing the exercise under guided advice no you're not doing it so what are you doing you're winging it such people who are overweight and doing their own jugar are exposing their body to additional stress markers so I say to you do it correctly nobody will die from intermittent fasting the human race is eating too much it is the eating too much that has brought you to that level of higher weight higher metabolic marker disease higher incidences or risk ratio of cancer or heart attack because you're at that higher level people have now understood that intermittent fasting can bring you down but you're doing it in the wrong way and food for thought why is the media focusing on this because recently a stock market share was set to double in the e-commerce apps the food delivery apps by two and a half times in the next 5 years if whole of India is eating lesser and having a smaller eating window and doing intermittent fasting guess who's ordering lesser from the e-commerce apps you and me so what we're going to tell you we're going to run newspaper articles saying that intermittent fasting is the worst thing that you can do it is wrong take it from me I have helped thousands of people lose weight and not get heart attacks because they do it with medically sound guided advice with my team of dietitians they work with their certified trainers and I send them to cardiovascular doctors for constant checkups to see that they're keeping Pace with the whole medication for BP and the cardiovascular problem also in India a lot of people self-medicate so when the doctor gives medication you stop the medication so put all of this together take an informed decision and if you're doing the intermittent fasting don't stop first things first go to your cardiologist go to your metabolic doctor second go to a medical nutritionist and get your diet aligned for proper eating go slow and steady don't try to do it 3 months try and do it in 3 years and above all work with a certified nutrition and get yourself exercise variables which can help you track your heart rate so you're actually working out in a proper State and you're not trying to push yourself in one hour of a crazy workout and better still if you want any help reach out to me and my team at Quan nutrition and we will reach out to you and we will try and help you get to the next
