[0.12 - 4.00] is your body the most expensive real
[1.96 - 7.16] estate if you are going to mistreat your
[4.00 - 9.68] own body which you can never replace so
[7.16 - 13.12] my thought process to people is you can
[9.68 - 14.76] control a lot of how you become based on
[13.12 - 16.68] the food you put into your body I also
[14.76 - 18.44] have this philosophies is today that as
[16.68 - 21.04] a human race we're eating more than we
[18.44 - 23.36] require problem with the human race is a
[21.04 - 25.96] lot of people for a long period in their
[23.36 - 29.00] own body behave as tenants the human
[25.96 - 32.28] race is eating too much today and we use
[29.00 - 33.72] food as a therapeutic bomb for stress
[32.28 - 36.00] you know so from that perspective I
[33.72 - 37.80] think uh we need to tell the gut boss
[36.00 - 41.04] there's a landlord in the body can we
[37.80 - 41.04] take control back again
