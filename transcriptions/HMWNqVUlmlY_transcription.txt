Title: Why Gene testing gives me better access to information on a clients health

Description: At Qua Nutrition, We are using Nutrigenomics to enable better nutritional choices and behavioural modification via counseling and repeated interaction to change the way people choose their foods or suppplements. Here are some of the links that may throw light on why I choose to lead my team with Nutrigenomics 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.

[0.29 - 6.39] hi my name is Ryan I'm a nutritionist
[4.05 - 8.10] I'm the founder of Co nutrition clinics
[6.39 - 10.41] we have about sixty dietitians on our
[8.10 - 12.84] team here in India and just replying to
[10.41 - 16.50] a question saying that nutrigenomics and
[12.84 - 19.11] genetics and diet and diet intervention
[16.50 - 21.45] and combining genetics really there's no
[19.11 - 23.67] science out there so I wanted to give
[21.45 - 25.47] you a viewpoint of how I have digested
[23.67 - 28.92] it for our business here in India and
[25.47 - 30.33] figured out what is the collaboration we
[28.92 - 33.39] have done with scientific research
[30.33 - 34.61] papers in terms of buying them acquiring
[33.39 - 37.38] them and reading it through
[34.61 - 39.90] collaborating with genetic researchers
[37.38 - 42.84] collaborating with companies that
[39.90 - 45.87] actually sell these gene tests so and
[42.84 - 47.22] and and they are PhDs in genetics and
[45.87 - 49.65] nutrigenomics and they give us
[47.22 - 51.18] information and then how when we are
[49.65 - 53.19] practicing as nutritionists with
[51.18 - 56.64] thousands of people how do we integrate
[53.19 - 59.01] everything together so I'm I started off
[56.64 - 61.77] this whole thing about 2008 when I
[59.01 - 63.96] started working with athletes and AC t3n
[61.77 - 65.46] was the first testing but I just
[63.96 - 67.29] prepared a quick presentation because
[65.46 - 69.03] you know these internet forums where you
[67.29 - 70.44] have to type up answers and answer them
[69.03 - 72.98] they go back and forth I believe you I
[70.44 - 75.57] don't believe you and stuff like that
[72.98 - 77.13] sometimes many of us don't have time to
[75.57 - 78.57] do these things because you too busy
[77.13 - 80.25] with counseling's back to back through
[78.57 - 82.17] the entire day so I thought I just put a
[80.25 - 84.42] viewpoint to answer certain questions
[82.17 - 88.62] whether these activities are fraudulent
[84.42 - 90.60] and so-called people out there who have
[88.62 - 92.67] called themselves evidence-based
[90.60 - 95.46] nutritionists or evidence-based doctors
[92.67 - 97.11] or evidence-based trainers need to look
[95.46 - 100.23] at the crux of the matter and how you
[97.11 - 102.00] digest the end result for your patient
[100.23 - 105.21] because I believe in a concept called as
[102.00 - 107.64] bio individuality and no one equation
[105.21 - 109.62] gives you an end result it's a sum of
[107.64 - 111.90] the whole we have 23,000 genes if you
[109.62 - 115.20] want to talk about genes so one genetic
[111.90 - 117.54] study on one diet gene related to high
[115.20 - 120.45] carbohydrate or high fat if it doesn't
[117.54 - 122.82] prove conclusively its right because
[120.45 - 125.19] that segment of population and my client
[122.82 - 127.53] walking in do not match but it's how you
[125.19 - 130.35] take the entire basket so I'm going it's
[127.53 - 132.09] going to quickly walk you through you
[130.35 - 133.62] know what I've been looking at so the
[132.09 - 135.99] test that we do over here okay
[133.62 - 137.70] is very simple is as a fitness gene test
[135.99 - 141.45] that comes that comes from this lab okay
[137.70 - 144.36] and we have things like aerobic capacity
[141.45 - 146.10] okay so endurance aerobic capacity heart
[144.36 - 148.02] capacity lung capacity now give you a
[146.10 - 149.76] simple one let's take lung capacity in
[148.02 - 152.61] lung capacity they take all of these
[149.76 - 154.53] genes over here now what happens is when
[152.61 - 157.35] a client has lung capacity in lower
[154.53 - 159.72] function this is an algorithm developed
[157.35 - 162.03] by the lab saying that may not have the
[159.72 - 163.92] best as a trainer as a coach as a
[162.03 - 165.45] nutritionist you may then go further
[163.92 - 166.98] with what we call as clinical
[165.45 - 169.56] assessments which could be the beep test
[166.98 - 172.20] or the vo2 max test I as a nutritionist
[169.56 - 174.93] would ask for the hemoglobin levels I
[172.20 - 176.97] will also look at your iron saturation
[174.93 - 178.89] total iron binding capacity ferritin
[176.97 - 181.68] levels so basically see that your lungs
[178.89 - 184.44] are at a good level now when I know this
[181.68 - 187.38] what we do is we figure out how we can
[184.44 - 188.82] bring in nutrition so for me the genetic
[187.38 - 190.50] lab is not telling me what to do with a
[188.82 - 193.11] lowered lung capacity but I'm bringing
[190.50 - 195.87] in omega-3 and lycopene because research
[193.11 - 199.74] papers on parallel functions have shown
[195.87 - 201.48] that lycopene and omega-3 M improve lung
[199.74 - 203.85] capacity so now I bring that together
[201.48 - 205.50] for an athletic thing but more than this
[203.85 - 208.05] I like some of the genes like for
[205.50 - 210.21] example let's talk about tendon strength
[208.05 - 212.22] and ligament strength I've had athletes
[210.21 - 214.44] with chronic injuries and that's from
[212.22 - 216.09] two decades past now we have these
[214.44 - 218.82] children who are between the ages of 10
[216.09 - 220.65] and 15 and they are working on a five to
[218.82 - 222.00] eight hours a day purely into sports
[220.65 - 224.31] performance to become an Olympic level
[222.00 - 226.14] athlete now what if I analyze all of
[224.31 - 228.15] these genes and the algorithm returned
[226.14 - 229.71] back to me says that the tendon strength
[228.15 - 232.47] is strong but the ligament strength is
[229.71 - 235.53] 50% or it's it's lowered or it's higher
[232.47 - 238.59] the common-sense approach over here is
[235.53 - 241.29] would be to enhance the diet with more
[238.59 - 244.05] amount of gelatin and a more amount of
[241.29 - 245.46] collagen now you would know the foods
[244.05 - 247.65] that are found in the planet and here
[245.46 - 249.54] that's how you would bring it in so this
[247.65 - 251.73] is this is something on the you know the
[249.54 - 253.14] sport the sports team this exercise this
[251.73 - 255.09] likelihood of fatigue you all know
[253.14 - 258.57] lactic acid they analyzed these two
[255.09 - 260.19] genes now go into those papers Google up
[258.57 - 261.72] the papers that are there from T and F
[260.19 - 263.97] and M C T yes you will say that there's
[261.72 - 267.84] no link but when we combine this with
[263.97 - 270.36] clinical testing lactate threshold
[267.84 - 273.12] at let's say the poolside and we see
[270.36 - 275.28] that LT thresholds are too low or too
[273.12 - 277.23] high then how do you bring nutritional
[275.28 - 279.24] interventions so the lamp is actually
[277.23 - 281.13] saying that you know ascorbic acid hmb
[279.24 - 282.90] but me as a sports nutritionist I have
[281.13 - 284.49] been figuring out of the years how you
[282.90 - 286.32] can do lactic acid buffering with a
[284.49 - 288.60] plethora of knowledge available there
[286.32 - 290.91] which is your magnesium with your
[288.60 - 293.25] bicarbonate buffer which is l-carnitine
[290.91 - 294.66] so many things now I try one doesn't
[293.25 - 296.37] work for the athlete and move on for the
[294.66 - 298.26] next 2-3 months figure it out
[296.37 - 299.85] this always of course adjustment that
[298.26 - 302.70] you're doing in terms of nutritional
[299.85 - 305.04] coaching again no one-size-fits-all it
[302.70 - 308.42] varies from person to person the next
[305.04 - 310.44] one which is which is the genetic
[308.42 - 312.78] nutrition test and this is where the
[310.44 - 315.33] diet part is saying that stuff on diet
[312.78 - 317.16] is fraudulent and stuff like that let me
[315.33 - 322.80] just show you my train of thought okay
[317.16 - 325.65] um sorry so let me let me just take a
[322.80 - 329.49] simple one which is let's take vitamin
[325.65 - 332.55] let's stop over here let's say b9 now b9
[329.49 - 334.08] is folic acid controlled by what is
[332.55 - 337.11] known as the methyl tetra hydro
[334.08 - 340.23] flow-rate reductase enzyme MTHFR gene
[337.11 - 342.03] one of the most widely researched genes
[340.23 - 344.76] today so for me this is diet
[342.03 - 347.19] I want to know how edom in b9 works so
[344.76 - 347.64] let me just show you you know where it
[347.19 - 350.04] is
[347.64 - 352.68] let me just find it because I made this
[350.04 - 354.42] presentation to on so most of the
[352.68 - 357.51] queries out there yeah it's over here
[354.42 - 359.82] okay so so if I can show you that you
[357.51 - 362.70] normally take an ordinary folic acid and
[359.82 - 365.43] it's broken down to 5-methyl
[362.70 - 367.62] tetrahydrofolate now basically what
[365.43 - 369.03] happens is let me just show this to you
[367.62 - 372.69] and I can make this presentation
[369.03 - 374.70] available to anyone who wants it also if
[372.69 - 377.99] you look over here when people come with
[374.70 - 380.04] heart attacks okay or higher
[377.99 - 382.20] predisposition for heart disease now let
[380.04 - 386.07] me show you how we how we actually get
[382.20 - 388.17] into it I go to the head gene okay so
[386.07 - 390.84] this is another genetic test in terms of
[388.17 - 392.70] health markers okay and we look at heart
[390.84 - 395.01] disease okay and in heart disease
[392.70 - 397.59] they're checking all of these markers
[395.01 - 400.59] okay now in one of those markers is
[397.59 - 401.44] MTHFR okay we have various other markers
[400.59 - 403.75] which the lab will
[401.44 - 405.91] give it to us okay now what I do is when
[403.75 - 407.77] I look at that marker I ask for a blood
[405.91 - 411.43] test and the blood test will come back
[407.77 - 414.73] let's say for homocysteine now if your
[411.43 - 417.16] homocysteine our levels are very high an
[414.73 - 419.11] alarm bell should go off in my head as a
[417.16 - 421.12] nutritionist saying hey hang on I'm a
[419.11 - 423.19] clinical biochemist homocysteine is
[421.12 - 425.20] really high I've done the gene test a
[423.19 - 426.87] predisposition to heart disease is there
[425.20 - 430.33] I've done the nutrition gene test
[426.87 - 433.30] specifically for the specifically for
[430.33 - 435.82] this guy the vitamin b9 and if it's
[433.30 - 438.22] coming green fine great but what if it
[435.82 - 440.35] comes red that means the MTHFR gene is
[438.22 - 442.24] not working well if it doesn't work well
[440.35 - 444.19] that's why homocysteine is going up so
[442.24 - 447.79] all I have to do is I have to start
[444.19 - 451.48] bringing in the following guys I have to
[447.79 - 454.57] bring in methyl folate as a supplement
[451.48 - 457.15] because your folic acid is not broken
[454.57 - 459.55] down to methylfolate and I need to focus
[457.15 - 462.94] on bitumen b12 so what I would do is I
[459.55 - 466.69] would also check vitamin b12 so if I
[462.94 - 469.12] look over here vitamin b12 is moderate
[466.69 - 471.19] now I correlate this from a genetic test
[469.12 - 473.80] so this is done once and I correlate
[471.19 - 475.18] this to other blood tests that we get so
[473.80 - 478.18] let me just show you what we do at
[475.18 - 481.72] Kornet Rishon okay if I can just show
[478.18 - 484.09] you so you know this is the this is a
[481.72 - 487.42] what all we capture height weight body
[484.09 - 490.66] fat percentages resting metabolic total
[487.42 - 492.43] skeletal fat total skeletal muscle sub
[490.66 - 495.52] Korean strong and if you see this I have
[492.43 - 495.97] this data of of a person a client of
[495.52 - 499.06] mine
[495.97 - 500.98] that's over about I think about five
[499.06 - 503.44] years and this is how we collect data
[500.98 - 504.97] and this is how we keep working on blood
[503.44 - 507.37] chemistry so let me just show you what
[504.97 - 509.14] all we capture okay so yeah assessment
[507.37 - 511.48] is all of these things that we capture
[509.14 - 513.70] symptoms we take it down Dietary recall
[511.48 - 515.62] we look at blood parameter so we look at
[513.70 - 517.69] blood testing at least every six months
[515.62 - 520.00] okay and when you're planning our diet
[517.69 - 521.68] chart we go into the Integrity's of
[520.00 - 522.67] every every part but I just want to show
[521.68 - 524.71] you when I am looking at a blood
[522.67 - 525.91] parameter I am when I'm planning a diet
[524.71 - 527.92] sure I'm looking at all of these
[525.91 - 529.15] parameters I'm looking at my genetic
[527.92 - 530.95] profile I'm looking and I don't wanna
[529.15 - 532.60] show you this stuff because this is
[530.95 - 534.46] stuff we've spent years developing and
[532.60 - 535.23] you know for people out there to say
[534.46 - 537.90] prove what
[535.23 - 540.36] doing well two Olympic medals Guinness
[537.90 - 543.06] world record of non-stop aerobics 7,000
[540.36 - 545.40] clients of which I think about 800 have
[543.06 - 547.95] been genetically tested and the genetic
[545.40 - 550.23] lines have had behavioral modification
[547.95 - 552.57] they have worked forward so I am NOT
[550.23 - 554.73] going on the low-carb high-fat kind of
[552.57 - 556.65] debate here I am going into specific
[554.73 - 559.08] individual markers related to disease
[556.65 - 561.75] with relationship to diet as well as
[559.08 - 563.73] biochemistry markers in the genetic test
[561.75 - 566.34] so for example let's say this person has
[563.73 - 567.54] LDL cholesterol is high okay and we have
[566.34 - 569.52] had it chronically high we have
[567.54 - 571.95] triglycerides very high how do I bring
[569.52 - 573.66] about dietary interventions so just to
[571.95 - 576.56] give you a sneak preview into what we do
[573.66 - 579.78] we actually have an excel sheet and
[576.56 - 583.41] let's say the persons are a veg sews
[579.78 - 585.69] okay and we have every nutrient possibly
[583.41 - 588.06] highlighted over here with the top
[585.69 - 594.30] nutrients let's say for example where's
[588.06 - 597.12] my where's my amino acids in the I just
[594.30 - 599.49] want to show you this yeah here it is
[597.12 - 600.78] okay so benign so I know now that moth
[599.49 - 602.79] bean is one of the highest and
[600.78 - 605.64] black-eyed beans is there so when I get
[602.79 - 607.20] my genetic test if it is significantly
[605.64 - 610.71] raised which is means it is in the red
[607.20 - 613.56] in the red bar then you know let's say
[610.71 - 616.86] so the in this case it was not there so
[613.56 - 620.10] let's assume it's there my my software
[616.86 - 622.62] will begin to tell me how many times
[620.10 - 624.42] that food has been required as an
[622.62 - 626.79] occurrence so in this person's case
[624.42 - 628.32] mushroom came up very high um this is
[626.79 - 630.00] not for F then I don't want to show you
[628.32 - 632.73] how I'm linking it because this is
[630.00 - 634.89] proprietary stuff and we are not
[632.73 - 638.07] cheating people we are not conning
[634.89 - 640.17] people we are giving them correct
[638.07 - 643.20] scientific advice based on blood tests
[640.17 - 645.30] based on assessment based on counseling
[643.20 - 647.52] or coordination based on the genetic
[645.30 - 649.41] behavior and this one thing that I want
[647.52 - 651.03] to show further over here okay so
[649.41 - 652.77] there's a lot of things that we learned
[651.03 - 654.99] okay I learned that L methylfolate if
[652.77 - 659.73] it's low and I just give L methylfolate
[654.99 - 661.83] even simple things like you know aging
[659.73 - 664.53] when we've added L methylfolate and my
[661.83 - 666.00] dad is memory improved so this there's a
[664.53 - 667.59] lot of stuff that you can learn and it's
[666.00 - 669.00] all available on the internet and I
[667.59 - 671.82] spoke about only
[669.00 - 674.28] gene for vitamin b9 so I just want to
[671.82 - 675.81] show you that what the rip what the lab
[674.28 - 678.21] is giving me is this giving this whole
[675.81 - 680.40] basket okay some of the genes are neck
[678.21 - 682.44] high how will i work with other that
[680.40 - 684.84] doesn't have any indication for me so
[682.44 - 688.20] let me just take for example them the
[684.84 - 689.94] the the fat storage genes okay or or let
[688.20 - 691.92] let me actually actually give you a flow
[689.94 - 693.87] sheet of what all we are looking at okay
[691.92 - 696.96] we're looking at cowboy's fats proteins
[693.87 - 699.12] minerals glue toes lactose and gluten
[696.96 - 701.75] and somebody said that a gluten power
[699.12 - 703.86] it's not it's it's it's not proved I
[701.75 - 706.08] personally have done my gluten DNA test
[703.86 - 708.30] I had looked in all my life and I had
[706.08 - 709.38] adult acne IBS problem and everything
[708.30 - 713.16] when I did the DNA test
[709.38 - 715.92] I stopped gluten okay by the way the
[713.16 - 718.26] blood test was not showing up okay the
[715.92 - 720.21] the blood tests were not showing up my
[718.26 - 722.43] gluten sensitivity but I was eating
[720.21 - 724.38] gluten but the DNA said my DNA said I
[722.43 - 726.09] have a gluten sensitivity so I decided
[724.38 - 728.64] eliminate it three months later when I
[726.09 - 731.52] wanted to bring back lutein I had severe
[728.64 - 734.16] huge issues with my body including a
[731.52 - 736.77] blood test that went to Here I am a wiry
[734.16 - 738.48] SRC reactor protein going up and this
[736.77 - 740.22] we're seeing with people in our clinic
[738.48 - 741.57] so when we are recommending it we're
[740.22 - 743.82] looking at a hey you got gluten
[741.57 - 744.27] intolerance but I'm eating gluten what
[743.82 - 746.19] should I do
[744.27 - 747.96] well continue eating if you're ok with
[746.19 - 751.20] it but if there are life-threatening
[747.96 - 754.68] diseases there high inflammation obesity
[751.20 - 757.35] ESR C reactive protein these markers are
[754.68 - 759.03] through the roof then Logic sense that
[757.35 - 761.16] maybe I should pay attention to this but
[759.03 - 763.26] what everyone out there saying oh but
[761.16 - 765.36] there is no proof that there is gluten
[763.26 - 767.40] related to the disease and it is not
[765.36 - 770.64] conclusively produced or per sorry
[767.40 - 773.46] proved my point of view is this I want
[770.64 - 776.19] to show you the lactose gene okay the
[773.46 - 778.62] lactose gene there was a study done they
[776.19 - 782.01] they are assuming that about 66 percent
[778.62 - 784.02] of South Indians I'm from India I 1.6
[782.01 - 785.82] million people you can't get a better
[784.02 - 787.83] diversity than our country to get
[785.82 - 792.21] mind-fucked sorry excuse my language
[787.83 - 794.67] because people within the same circle of
[792.21 - 796.77] a state can have so much of diversity
[794.67 - 798.48] you do not know whether what one study
[796.77 - 800.34] was done in one location works another
[798.48 - 802.98] study done on the location box what you
[800.34 - 804.96] have to do is have the belief that when
[802.98 - 806.88] you're testing you're looking at all
[804.96 - 808.71] these prongs and taking off the best
[806.88 - 810.51] that you can from it so it's saying
[808.71 - 811.80] about 80 percent of the North Indian and
[810.51 - 814.05] sixty-six percent of the South Indian
[811.80 - 816.06] population is is lactose intolerant now
[814.05 - 818.31] guess guess what when I'm trying to tell
[816.06 - 820.53] a mother that I can't give galactose to
[818.31 - 822.54] a kid because the kids saying I've got
[820.53 - 824.85] gasps I've got flatlands and I've got to
[822.54 - 826.74] lose motions and I feel discomfort and
[824.85 - 828.63] the whole world including my coach and
[826.74 - 830.55] everybody else says drink milk or have a
[828.63 - 831.78] lot of dairy product and you can see
[830.55 - 832.80] that the kid gets up early morning
[831.78 - 835.17] there's a lot of mucus production
[832.80 - 838.65] because you ask these questions in your
[835.17 - 841.35] dietary recall hang on nobody's
[838.65 - 843.36] listening to you so then we do it we do
[841.35 - 846.54] the genetic test for the lactose and
[843.36 - 849.03] there are two variants call em cm6
[846.54 - 850.68] okay and basically if it's normal you
[849.03 - 853.23] can produce lactase normally and if it's
[850.68 - 856.26] it normal it's not there so the idea is
[853.23 - 858.27] what is the study the studies 153
[856.26 - 860.76] healthy volunteers okay
[858.27 - 862.32] I mean 1.6 billion population you are
[860.76 - 864.78] asking me to trust a scientific study
[862.32 - 866.91] 153 people so let's do one thing let's
[864.78 - 868.44] wait for the next 20 years till we scan
[866.91 - 870.09] the whole population and then we'll rely
[868.44 - 872.88] on this methodology of the new genetic
[870.09 - 874.53] testing or you take your common sense
[872.88 - 877.23] learning of 10 20 years
[874.53 - 879.18] you take your assessment recall you take
[877.23 - 880.53] your physical parameters you take your
[879.18 - 882.54] blood chemistry and you add this
[880.53 - 884.16] component of genetic testing and bring
[882.54 - 885.96] this whole thing holistic together for
[884.16 - 887.25] example people are surrounded I drink
[885.96 - 891.03] coffee should I not drink coffee
[887.25 - 894.99] the cyp one a two gene clearly studied
[891.03 - 896.49] google it up okay you have a slow
[894.99 - 898.80] metabolizer and you have a fast
[896.49 - 899.64] metabolizer how do you do that okay
[898.80 - 901.29] forget coffee
[899.64 - 905.25] let's go more nutritionally to women
[901.29 - 909.15] okay 48% of women in India have
[905.25 - 912.00] haemoglobin lesser than 12 okay now if I
[909.15 - 914.49] analyze these two genes and I know the
[912.00 - 916.20] variance and the I and both variants are
[914.49 - 919.89] likely to have lower iron level in the
[916.20 - 921.60] blood and my iron saturation total iron
[919.89 - 923.82] binding capacity ferritin in the blood
[921.60 - 926.37] test or all day you may say to me Ryan
[923.82 - 928.20] Fernando why are you doing genetic
[926.37 - 930.03] testing when a conclusive blood test can
[928.20 - 931.73] do that because doctors have been doing
[930.03 - 935.57] this all these years they've been giving
[931.73 - 937.55] pills of iron supplementation and then
[935.57 - 939.74] getting results hang on we do the
[937.55 - 942.44] glutton DNA test we have had a gluten
[939.74 - 944.60] positive we pull people off gluten and I
[942.44 - 947.57] asking what gluten got to do it I on the
[944.60 - 951.02] microvilli damage google this up again
[947.57 - 952.97] the the the Sanyal ins and the attack to
[951.02 - 955.31] the micro villi micro nutrient
[952.97 - 957.32] absorption decreases so on one hand I'm
[955.31 - 959.27] getting behavioral compliance because
[957.32 - 961.64] I've told them non that I can watch it
[959.27 - 963.74] in the in the blood test I know the gene
[961.64 - 966.08] in iron is also low so when you have
[963.74 - 968.03] triple-whammy like this genetic testing
[966.08 - 970.70] allows you to have a crystal ball gazing
[968.03 - 974.21] and what could be the future of your
[970.70 - 975.38] therapy given to a client so that's
[974.21 - 979.40] what's there
[975.38 - 981.14] you now have b12 about 70% or off of the
[979.40 - 982.94] clients walking into my clinic who are
[981.14 - 985.07] vegetarian and you know this bit well is
[982.94 - 987.71] only found a non which how do I convince
[985.07 - 990.98] them to take a supplement okay so when
[987.71 - 994.70] the gene in b12 if the variant is normal
[990.98 - 997.46] and the blood test is low variant normal
[994.70 - 998.99] blood test low then I have to look at
[997.46 - 1000.97] intrinsic factor I have to look at
[998.99 - 1003.04] acidity I have to look at probiotics and
[1000.97 - 1004.66] gut problem if it's normal I don't need
[1003.04 - 1006.49] to do anything and and I just tell them
[1004.66 - 1008.17] you know come back every or keep eating
[1006.49 - 1011.26] correctly and stuff like that so there's
[1008.17 - 1014.11] a lot that you can do okay and then this
[1011.26 - 1016.24] move for okay Mon on saturated fat so
[1014.11 - 1018.16] everybody in Europe and an America storm
[1016.24 - 1021.73] coming that olive oil is the greatest
[1018.16 - 1023.62] oil but there's not enough significant
[1021.73 - 1024.88] research in India because olives are not
[1023.62 - 1026.56] grown in this part of the world and
[1024.88 - 1028.24] they're move far and guess what
[1026.56 - 1030.19] most of the Indians that we are testing
[1028.24 - 1033.58] have a better predisposition to
[1030.19 - 1036.10] saturated fat so now my clients are
[1033.58 - 1039.25] adding olive oil to the diet and if it's
[1036.10 - 1041.20] crossing if it's crossing more than 30%
[1039.25 - 1042.52] of the total total energy expenditure so
[1041.20 - 1044.13] nobody's calorie balancing it so they're
[1042.52 - 1047.05] coming to me and saying how do I do this
[1044.13 - 1048.94] this is where we are then saying okay
[1047.05 - 1050.83] this is how we would split the oils and
[1048.94 - 1054.22] this is how we would we would make a
[1050.83 - 1057.27] behavior of people you know how do you
[1054.22 - 1059.29] prescribe a better choice of an oil and
[1057.27 - 1061.12] people will come back to me and say yeah
[1059.29 - 1063.37] you need to do you need to do cyclic
[1061.12 - 1066.28] seasonal and all of that stuff fine will
[1063.37 - 1068.44] incorporate that into it also at the end
[1066.28 - 1069.10] of the day the guy sitting in front of
[1068.44 - 1070.99] the client
[1069.10 - 1072.91] who's prescribing and I used the word
[1070.99 - 1074.89] prescribing the diet should have all the
[1072.91 - 1077.02] tools necessary to help them check it
[1074.89 - 1078.79] out okay I'm sorry this video is going
[1077.02 - 1080.35] really long but I get really pissed off
[1078.79 - 1081.85] and people keep poking me and asking me
[1080.35 - 1084.25] and they do I am a nutrigenomics
[1081.85 - 1087.01] counselor and I do teach this course in
[1084.25 - 1088.90] in India to a lot of people and a lot of
[1087.01 - 1090.34] people in India do not want to spend
[1088.90 - 1091.90] money to learn but attack you on the
[1090.34 - 1092.44] internet saying or what you're doing is
[1091.90 - 1094.69] rubbish
[1092.44 - 1096.13] I'll just show you a quick insight I
[1094.69 - 1099.37] don't know if somebody's gonna shoot me
[1096.13 - 1101.32] for this but when you take PUFA okay
[1099.37 - 1105.79] have a look at this if they're APO a1
[1101.32 - 1107.83] carriers in women okay if they are with
[1105.79 - 1109.99] the AAA allele then they're gonna have a
[1107.83 - 1112.57] higher HDL if they're with a GG they're
[1109.99 - 1114.91] gonna have a lower HDL now when I get
[1112.57 - 1117.94] this data and I can significantly look
[1114.91 - 1120.43] at it on different numbers of the genes
[1117.94 - 1123.40] and whether I have a with poof or a high
[1120.43 - 1125.71] LDL low HDL guess what I can design a
[1123.40 - 1129.88] diet I don't keep that up or alarm
[1125.71 - 1131.86] because you know it's very complicated
[1129.88 - 1135.67] on how we do it with our Excel sheets in
[1131.86 - 1137.32] the background but you know figure it
[1135.67 - 1140.20] out whether it works or not that's
[1137.32 - 1142.99] that's York gets your cost to figure it
[1140.20 - 1144.40] out we are changing people's health what
[1142.99 - 1148.12] else is it that I want to show you that
[1144.40 - 1149.92] we do we have the blood test and look at
[1148.12 - 1151.63] look at the food schedules okay so we
[1149.92 - 1154.08] are taking out the entire food shredders
[1151.63 - 1157.12] and when we plan a nutrition plan okay
[1154.08 - 1159.34] we look at the protein the carbs the
[1157.12 - 1161.26] fats at every level the choice of foods
[1159.34 - 1163.42] the choice of foods is linked to the
[1161.26 - 1166.48] blood parameter or the gene that you
[1163.42 - 1167.98] could select over here and the referral
[1166.48 - 1172.21] recommendation that has been given
[1167.98 - 1174.58] overall there's a lot I love this report
[1172.21 - 1175.93] and I'm not going to be apologetic yeah
[1174.58 - 1177.61] you want to say it's a load of
[1175.93 - 1180.04] please do you want to call me a fraud
[1177.61 - 1184.93] please call me a fraud I have absolutely
[1180.04 - 1186.70] no issues I know what we do is based on
[1184.93 - 1188.62] giving the best possible health care to
[1186.70 - 1192.22] people I look at this vitamin b9 and
[1188.62 - 1193.66] vitamin D okay vitamin K and by the way
[1192.22 - 1194.80] people say that here you know what you
[1193.66 - 1196.42] could do this with the blood test that's
[1194.80 - 1198.99] more conclusive
[1196.42 - 1200.98] each vitamin testing in India is around
[1198.99 - 1202.93] 7,500 rupees that's about a hundred
[1200.98 - 1206.92] dollars and the whole ji
[1202.93 - 1208.51] test cost to $99 so my point of view is
[1206.92 - 1210.22] if I am looking at calcium I'm looking
[1208.51 - 1212.77] at copper I'm looking at magnesium I'm
[1210.22 - 1214.33] looking at phosphate I'm looking at zinc
[1212.77 - 1215.77] I'm looking at these absorptions of
[1214.33 - 1217.41] these I'm looking at antioxidants
[1215.77 - 1219.94] caffeine absorption gluten lactose
[1217.41 - 1221.77] intolerance ok salt intake and blood
[1219.94 - 1224.11] pressure sensitivity riboflavin and
[1221.77 - 1226.96] blood pressure sensitivity it allows me
[1224.11 - 1231.40] to design the nutrition plan in that
[1226.96 - 1233.98] direction and you know my discussion
[1231.40 - 1235.30] started around five years ago when we
[1233.98 - 1239.38] have been with looking at this stuff
[1235.30 - 1241.60] being launched in 2013 we're now in 2018
[1239.38 - 1245.34] way it's considered practice in the
[1241.60 - 1248.56] Dietetic sphere to go ahead in it and
[1245.34 - 1250.00] there is there is a lot of there's a lot
[1248.56 - 1252.40] of internet out there which says that
[1250.00 - 1254.41] yes people are falsely promoting it to
[1252.40 - 1256.15] sell their supplements and that's where
[1254.41 - 1258.43] I disagree I'm I'm looking at it not
[1256.15 - 1260.44] promoting a supplement if you remember
[1258.43 - 1263.17] what I showed you I am looking at the
[1260.44 - 1265.75] foods which I'm looking at the foods
[1263.17 - 1268.57] which which I want to actually you know
[1265.75 - 1269.89] really really recommend it to a person
[1268.57 - 1272.11] by understanding which are the highest
[1269.89 - 1273.94] contents of those foods and maybe
[1272.11 - 1276.10] somehow seeing that if this food is
[1273.94 - 1277.81] there can I add that to diet and then go
[1276.10 - 1279.67] back to my diet chart you know my back
[1277.81 - 1281.62] end I tried six seven ask to prepare
[1279.67 - 1283.57] because I'm going in and over here and
[1281.62 - 1285.16] then I'm going into clinical assessment
[1283.57 - 1287.17] and I'm looking at dietary call and I'm
[1285.16 - 1289.12] checking or he doesn't like prunes and
[1287.17 - 1290.86] spicy food so I'm not going to give him
[1289.12 - 1292.72] prune so I go back again to my excel
[1290.86 - 1294.37] sheet his prunes over you know prunes is
[1292.72 - 1296.23] not away then I'll do a search over here
[1294.37 - 1297.79] and I'll look for prunes you know so I
[1296.23 - 1299.26] look for prunes over here and figure out
[1297.79 - 1300.19] he's prunes they're in my
[1299.26 - 1302.71] softwareplanner
[1300.19 - 1304.39] and it's not there so great so now I can
[1302.71 - 1307.42] start a bedding in this and preparing
[1304.39 - 1309.16] his diet plan or her diet plan so the
[1307.42 - 1316.39] final conclusion that I want to actually
[1309.16 - 1318.16] show you is was it this one the overlap
[1316.39 - 1320.32] on how we think no it was not this one
[1318.16 - 1322.48] how does the doctor treat your diagnosis
[1320.32 - 1325.11] and treatment my that's reactionary
[1322.48 - 1327.79] behavior my point is can we anticipate
[1325.11 - 1329.83] how nutrition can really really help a
[1327.79 - 1331.30] person and there was a study and I'm
[1329.83 - 1333.04] going to post this link okay a
[1331.30 - 1335.02] systematic review of genetic testing and
[1333.04 - 1336.65] lifestyle behavior change are we using
[1335.02 - 1339.80] high quality genetic inventions
[1336.65 - 1341.66] considering behavior theory the one line
[1339.80 - 1344.78] that convinced me five years ago to
[1341.66 - 1347.05] actually go with with this was the most
[1344.78 - 1350.93] promising lifestyle changes war in
[1347.05 - 1353.69] nutrition period now I run a business
[1350.93 - 1355.94] with nine clinics and sixty dietitians
[1353.69 - 1357.35] if you believe that this is the wrong
[1355.94 - 1359.39] thing so be it
[1357.35 - 1362.21] people are coming to us because we are
[1359.39 - 1363.98] getting results we're getting positive
[1362.21 - 1365.54] testimonials and if you watch our Google
[1363.98 - 1368.75] reviews online we have one of the
[1365.54 - 1370.73] highest google reviews in india in terms
[1368.75 - 1372.53] of the quality of the review and the
[1370.73 - 1374.66] number of reviews i mean if that's not
[1372.53 - 1377.51] food for thought and the credentials of
[1374.66 - 1379.82] my team all offers our master degree
[1377.51 - 1383.00] holders we are not certificate holders
[1379.82 - 1385.40] we have studied post-graduation degrees
[1383.00 - 1388.31] and we are doing this so i hope this
[1385.40 - 1390.32] video helps and if it doesn't help i'm
[1388.31 - 1391.94] having a ball still learning and if you
[1390.32 - 1394.16] have stuff to show me that I can learn
[1391.94 - 1396.83] from you so so happy to receive it
[1394.16 - 1402.26] i'm on instagram it's ryan nutrition
[1396.83 - 1403.82] coach i am on facebook and i do a radio
[1402.26 - 1405.08] show here in Bangalore in India and I
