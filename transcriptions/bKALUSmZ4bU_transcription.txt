intolerant I don't know what to do it's so sad like most of the things that I like eating everything has lieutenant but I don't have it so that it's much better off that you can eat you can but I thought yeah but I won't like my coffee like a good cup of coffee every evening before work our time the fact that I can't have it all I got shouldn't rather have it is quite shiny but I know that it's thick for my good coffee for biscuits and pizzas burgers cakes yeah that's true I am slightly luckier than you but like you know my body not being able to you know absorb caffeine is also like slightly sad yeah my ring stuff yeah I think so Nick ever since I bought the G test and then ryan told me that you know caffeine can also be a trigger for migraine and absolutely you know had I known this earlier I think I would have still handle lesser episodes of severe migraine as the tea attacks than I would have probably missed less because of it yeah having a good nutritionist and having a plan your nutrition is so important they you need to not let at least need to know what you know how to feel the body and what suits them what's going to make them better athlete and for something like that you know I'm very glad that we have dynamic that anything else with the nutrition so I think I'm coping without the Newton because much sparser and more it I think everything o that they recommend us to eat you know that and like whatever quantity so that's definitely that will help our body to stay in top shape and recover from one car to another and also diversity is really important you know vitamins and supplements that we do need and you know especially since you're getting older I think you need to take care of your nutrition slightly for because you know your body doesn't recover enough yeah and even though you are you know like the physical body everything mossad an awkward nutrition also plays a very big role in recovery definitely anion has been so helpful with you know recommending and suggesting what we should eat and what quantity to eat it it just gets so easy to you know prepare meals and no heat the connect to it yeah my answers no you can't expect a while to perform like a Ferrari and then give it food like an ambassador that's you will yourself like you're fueling up are you take person that's so true I mean you can't expect to eat cakes and pastries and then go and you know too hard a kilometer about success will be help I'm not I can't eat cakes at they still decide for you know just an example yeah yeah nobody that happy times already cakes and pastries about even though like I found out I was proven thing much later if only you I had the knowledge about this much of you if I dug this gene when I was much younger as a kid I think I was probably you know but actually I'm talking about cakes and pastries and you being looted intolerant then I mean so many times with like a chocolate or like pastry then on the phone without yes I never will take me you finished legging I need the water and because of the sugar we've had such a crash in the middle of the workout and you know just like Oh consulting with Ryan it's just helped us understand better what we should be prior to and after work on to avoid such you know circumstances where you are you're feeling heavy in over powder you have a sudden crash because you're in too much sugar true yeah I mean more than what to eat also how much to eat and when to eat makes a huge difference that's nodding up a burger was for both sides once I got since I will start working with my recovery is so much better and I think also my the quality of my focus has improved substantially so I'm hoping you know in the long run will definitely make me much faster and much more lytic yeah and also the fact that uh you know the food that he recommends all the times that he gives it pretty much covers your carbs proteins essential vitamins and minerals so you have to depend lesser on supplements as was is really really falling short which is I think very good if you're getting you know your main sources of caffeine and you know of fat and essential vitamins and then the strong fruits and vegetables and your need oh you know it's just generally I think it's much better than you know taking unnecessary supplements to fill yourself subdue does need to be taken with the right kind of guidance you just don't take things because somebody else takes them on taking ten scoop of protein per day or fifteen but is neither created per day is not going to make you exaction multivitamins like maybe water is recommended to you you know I may need slightly more because you know my body doesn't absorb the certain vitamins in spite of all you know that I just need like my body needs more of it so and last Kalama girls so I think having a proper nutritionist but it is very very important yeah you can't just blindly follow someone else's diet or what someone else is having in terms of you know supplements or multivitamins and all the other important things yeah commander everyone gets a nutritionist and you know they're gay and improve yourself and make yourself better athletes and stronger athletes at that and I think we've been working with Ryan for about a few months definitely found a lot of difference you know we can recover better we are eating mindfully of course we do cheap we don't call it a cheat but you know I think that's what science has helped us understand that it's not exactly a cheat but yeah that you know we're humans at the end of the day so you know even if he is gluten intolerant like the guy and says you know maybe once a month he can have a burger Rita you know just to you know like make yourself happy even that's important but you do need a proper nutritionist to guide you in the right direction of what to eat what not to eat and how much to eat and Ryan has been fabulous in helping us you know recover in terms of a sport and everything yeah I would definitely recommend out but I had no patience for us
