Title: Understanding GUT issues, its symptoms & effects and what should you do about it - Ryan Fernando

Description: You can contact us at 9743430000 to know how you can do a planned nutrition diet for healing your gut.. Visit: , Our GI tracts work tirelessly to keep us healthy and happy. When our gut health is harmed, we might suffer serious health effects. The gut's hard work permits nutrients and water to enter the body while keeping poisons and allergens out. It's a selected barrier that separates "us" from the rest of the world. A troubled gut, on the other hand, is powerless to defend us. Instead, it permits harmful substances into the body. Nutrition can help in this situation. The appropriate diet improves overall health and well-being by strengthening the stomach in its guardian role. However, scientists have recently revealed that the GI system performs a far larger and more sophisticated function than previously thought. It's been connected to a variety of health issues that don't seem to have anything to do with digestion, including emotional wellbeing, immunity, and chronic illnesses like cancer and Type 2 diabetes. The GI tract contains trillions of bacteria that not only aid in the digestion of food, but also aid in the maintenance of homeostasis and overall health. Although everyone's microbiome is different, there are some broad rules about what is and isn't healthy. A vast assortment of organisms can be found in healthy persons. There is significantly less diversity in an ill person, and there appears to be an increase in germs linked to disease. Anxiety and sadness, as well as neurological diseases like schizophrenia and dementia, have all been related to gut health. The composition of gut bacteria differs between lean and overweight people, suggesting that it may play a role in the development of obesity. #guthealth #ryanfernando #dietplantoimproveguthealth

[0.03 - 6.63] I finally know I'm a nutritionist I am
[4.38 - 8.82] working with a lot of people at the
[6.63 - 10.56] coalition winning as chief nutritionist
[8.82 - 12.51] every day I come across a lot of
[10.56 - 14.76] problems now I am in the domain of
[12.51 - 16.26] sports but most people have come into
[14.76 - 19.11] our clinics with one issue and that's
[16.26 - 21.69] covered now what is God God is so
[19.11 - 23.64] stomach the recent papers you know
[21.69 - 25.35] you're intersted smaller designs I
[23.64 - 28.05] understand and it could range from
[25.35 - 31.20] anything from bad breath right up till
[28.05 - 33.63] living income schools or constipation so
[31.20 - 36.36] 3x1 spend a little time with you this
[33.63 - 38.97] video is for people who have issues with
[36.36 - 40.80] their gut or who have loved ones so
[38.97 - 42.90] happy feet to their God I'm going to
[40.80 - 45.66] give you some insights on why you want
[42.90 - 47.46] to change the way you eat or the food
[45.66 - 50.46] choices that you have and hopefully over
[47.46 - 53.16] 10 15 minutes to discover what you need
[50.46 - 54.99] to do as an activity now in terms of God
[53.16 - 57.30] with one very interesting thing that I
[54.99 - 60.36] want to show you is that we need to
[57.30 - 63.33] understand Haga okay so if yoga you have
[60.36 - 68.10] just a monk you have your pancreas your
[63.33 - 70.35] food goes in a clockwise manner so you
[68.10 - 72.69] go clockwise not now and the food
[70.35 - 74.55] digests it comes out so it's got the
[72.69 - 77.64] upper GI and the way
[74.55 - 81.45] all of this is subject of food day in
[77.64 - 84.66] and day out it is going like week one
[81.45 - 86.52] here is like a classic Jack if it is
[84.66 - 87.75] hunter is going and anything sipping
[86.52 - 90.45] some traffic is going in and it's
[87.75 - 93.39] exiting so input and output are
[90.45 - 94.86] important things and we judge to see if
[93.39 - 98.19] your car is in good health
[94.86 - 101.27] okay so what they have you need to
[98.19 - 103.62] understand is the lining of your gut
[101.27 - 107.40] imagine the lining of the guard leg of
[103.62 - 110.40] beautiful cocktail we do microvilli okay
[107.40 - 113.15] now when you have a surah nisa lying on
[110.40 - 115.71] the tip type of food it goes in a taxi
[113.15 - 117.93] carpet like structure so that's in the
[115.71 - 119.82] airport know that carpet will solve one
[117.93 - 121.71] of the health that is a person who has
[119.82 - 124.95] an irritable father who has a gut system
[121.71 - 127.26] problem but if you have that problem and
[124.95 - 130.14] week that items without the food
[127.26 - 132.81] poisoning on external cheap restaurant
[130.14 - 134.79] whose yes restaurants buy the cheapest
[132.81 - 136.47] quality raw material cheapest oils and
[134.79 - 138.60] feel that with the best of possibilities
[136.47 - 143.16] so those whose an attack so come over
[138.60 - 145.53] years ago that these microvilli okay can
[143.16 - 147.27] affect it but this is one of my training
[145.53 - 150.57] courses I'm doing a gut health training
[147.27 - 152.58] courses across the country this one not
[150.57 - 155.13] fertilization this one is for you with
[152.58 - 157.27] consumables about head so let me just
[155.13 - 160.47] let me just go forward
[157.27 - 160.47] one reason
[169.35 - 177.45] okay we have a huge quantity of bacteria
[174.60 - 178.32] in our Sun to enter the system listen if
[177.45 - 180.45] this is a bar
[178.32 - 183.72] this would show a knife inside that that
[180.45 - 186.39] laggy is got 2 kgs almost of bacteria
[183.72 - 188.13] but these bacteria can you could that
[186.39 - 188.64] you better get me out do you see in a
[188.13 - 190.50] kneeboard
[188.64 - 191.61] the key when people visit Turkey a
[190.50 - 193.86] movement that maybe some people
[191.61 - 195.33] neighborhood are learning it was very
[193.86 - 197.04] clear that the people taking over
[195.33 - 198.75] everything so like that you can have
[197.04 - 201.90] good pocket you can have bad your
[198.75 - 204.72] fingers okay and you have 100 alien
[201.90 - 208.10] bacteria and viruses of microcosm all of
[204.72 - 210.81] those guys which means you are I am more
[208.10 - 213.54] microorganism then the cells of the
[210.81 - 216.51] human body so it might be careful
[213.54 - 219.12] attention to change your micro flora
[216.51 - 223.17] micro flora is worn these guys which
[219.12 - 225.18] other faculty okay so these bacteria can
[223.17 - 227.31] become toxic if we good bacteria and
[225.18 - 229.44] then maybe back back here people who are
[227.31 - 231.84] on the factor side they have a higher
[229.44 - 235.11] amount of the bag because they take
[231.84 - 237.24] people or beasts on it aside so if you
[235.11 - 239.52] want to do see you might want to get is
[237.24 - 241.52] bad that you pushed out of the body and
[239.52 - 244.47] you want to come to your good bacteria
[241.52 - 245.58] okay so I just wanna take to the so much
[244.47 - 248.16] of learning
[245.58 - 249.84] in terms of immune system on song this
[248.16 - 253.32] is a very private we're not teaching
[249.84 - 257.82] program to check I don't wanna get into
[253.32 - 259.74] the details of it but this one video
[257.82 - 262.98] that I want to show you which is the
[259.74 - 265.95] main site now this is microcut diversity
[262.98 - 268.89] or crossover we have Indians way from
[265.95 - 271.71] here to study study America India so
[268.89 - 274.71] settle down in America the diversity of
[271.71 - 278.19] the microbe is different their example
[274.71 - 280.35] in India we have Prevotella se which is
[278.19 - 283.20] higher because of a plant-based diet and
[280.35 - 286.26] in America that same three part over
[283.20 - 288.69] here is actually very very tiny because
[286.26 - 291.36] it's predominantly of protein based time
[288.69 - 293.58] so when it is a little gate to another
[291.36 - 295.74] part of the world this is one reason why
[293.58 - 299.37] you get irritable bowel syndrome because
[295.74 - 301.56] for centuries their countries be used to
[299.37 - 303.96] a certain type of failure which is
[301.56 - 306.00] genetically linked to your environment
[303.96 - 307.98] and nobody's talking about this in the
[306.00 - 311.19] world today that I tried from here to
[307.98 - 312.75] there your food for centuries and
[311.19 - 314.49] centuries has been without airline
[312.75 - 316.26] travel without visas and without
[314.49 - 318.18] passports so now you would really
[316.26 - 320.67] terrific articulate you citizenship
[318.18 - 322.17] hang on you get into passport but your
[320.67 - 324.18] car doesn't get a new passport
[322.17 - 326.19] food for thought you need to contact a
[324.18 - 329.22] nutritionist in here and you need to
[326.19 - 333.24] find out how to choose those foods which
[329.22 - 335.52] are kind of localized to the genes so
[333.24 - 339.25] case when I think of genes what I wanted
[335.52 - 343.19] to show you was I just wanted some
[339.25 - 344.27] jeans which is we do the nutrition
[343.19 - 346.40] t-test okay
[344.27 - 348.62] so for example when you good nutrition
[346.40 - 352.31] teeth yes I come to know whether a
[348.62 - 355.04] carbohydrate and Betty who gain weight
[352.31 - 357.20] or whatever now what happens if anybody
[355.04 - 360.50] was one of my bootys that it does that
[357.20 - 363.47] change my genetics what white okay
[360.50 - 365.75] in terms of oil in fact I found out that
[363.47 - 369.26] mostly we Indians
[365.75 - 371.57] okay vegans have a very high saturated
[369.26 - 373.61] fat intake compete very very fine
[371.57 - 379.16] subsidy too tightly they could happen
[373.61 - 381.44] move far most part which is mu F P now
[379.16 - 385.57] move ahead one has rated passes for many
[381.44 - 389.33] other very good the Macmillan's for the
[385.57 - 391.64] European man in eating that the testing
[389.33 - 393.62] is a saturated fat whoo-hoo saturated
[391.64 - 396.17] fat food it's the way the coconut oil
[393.62 - 398.00] okay
[396.17 - 400.22] nothing that you don't have to how to
[398.00 - 403.85] think about it these things were made
[400.22 - 406.01] over centuries by old press so you would
[403.85 - 408.20] have the lukeroyle the sesame oil
[406.01 - 411.53] okay the team or you could have the
[408.20 - 413.03] bastard of the GG or the coconut oil in
[411.53 - 415.43] this part of the world sure I had come
[413.03 - 417.61] from South India and we used to have
[415.43 - 419.78] this press neither he is chemically
[417.61 - 420.35] extracted in that's affecting the camp
[419.78 - 423.08] again
[420.35 - 426.23] Saudi it exactly but what I want to show
[423.08 - 429.08] you was that we can discover each of
[426.23 - 430.97] these and repository
[429.08 - 433.97] this one thing I get whose motions all
[430.97 - 436.99] the time acidity clearance
[433.97 - 440.21] I am puking blood pooling blood
[436.99 - 442.34] this happens okay
[440.21 - 446.06] I just stopped ringing all the vitamins
[442.34 - 449.30] okay so you've got vitamin b12 b6 okay
[446.06 - 452.81] we will get by the p90 550 will get
[449.30 - 454.67] vitamin E going to be key what else we
[452.81 - 456.53] have been looking at quite a catch it
[454.67 - 458.27] means so we're looking at everything
[456.53 - 460.61] possible under the Sun we'll be looking
[458.27 - 463.46] at I am we're looking at magnesia yeah
[460.61 - 466.79] it's a good listener got this blood test
[463.46 - 470.72] in Eau Claire Wisconsin genetic see each
[466.79 - 473.11] gene powerful enough to lift up iron
[470.72 - 476.99] from your time and processing
[473.11 - 478.70] assimilated so as a nutritionist we
[476.99 - 481.37] don't need something on everything it's
[478.70 - 485.77] epigenetics is the behavior of the
[481.37 - 488.57] environment which is the food the Sun
[485.77 - 492.14] your family all of this psychological
[488.57 - 495.11] which works on your cup so if I'm able
[492.14 - 497.99] to get the GG test done at the blood
[495.11 - 501.17] test time I have like astrologer and
[497.99 - 504.68] going into your crystal ball I can
[501.17 - 507.77] predict that in 2025 you will start
[504.68 - 509.84] moving blood and by 2030 you will read
[507.77 - 512.93] any jokes apart
[509.84 - 514.19] forgive my dry sense of humor but just
[512.93 - 519.46] the point okay
[514.19 - 523.45] we do this because dr. sweetie
[519.46 - 525.55] but medicines do not cure the root cause
[523.45 - 526.81] of the problem let's understand what
[525.55 - 528.91] caused the problem
[526.81 - 530.98] it could be something as simple you make
[528.91 - 532.27] each of receptors not absorbing ours my
[530.98 - 535.81] piece of garbage will gut health
[532.27 - 538.69] do you know 90% of constipation problems
[535.81 - 541.03] can be solved which is magnesium one at
[538.69 - 543.70] a time because the medium is responsible
[541.03 - 547.48] for your smooth muscle contraction as
[543.70 - 549.07] the food goes through your intestine and
[547.48 - 550.87] it may give you a deficient so the baby
[549.07 - 553.18] must move your leg muscles and muscle
[550.87 - 554.86] heart muscle but weak muscles are the
[553.18 - 557.41] tightest muscles before the I bought
[554.86 - 560.50] water I don't have enough stuff hang on
[557.41 - 562.15] let's not for three days I think
[560.50 - 564.67] you have inflammation in the docs
[562.15 - 565.87] sitting inside of you so I'm not going
[564.67 - 567.67] to get people to understand that
[565.87 - 569.68] something as simple as a as a vacation
[567.67 - 572.52] is separately create a lot of issues for
[569.68 - 574.81] you but comes back to my back health
[572.52 - 576.58] okay that's something that I wanted
[574.81 - 578.68] that's something I wanted to show you
[576.58 - 582.27] all but the other thing I wanted to show
[578.68 - 582.27] your body but it is stupid
[587.87 - 594.41] I have also to ask people do you have
[592.01 - 596.21] this one in center to the contender we
[594.41 - 598.97] are perhaps constipation that are going
[596.21 - 600.85] absolutely food allergies we do food
[598.97 - 603.23] allergy testing food intolerance
[600.85 - 604.79] inflammation people have proved it
[603.23 - 606.65] people like an equal because before I
[604.79 - 611.39] get it happen people are getting steal
[606.65 - 614.15] natural sonex's synopsis is yoga if you
[611.39 - 615.47] have the skin issue you can unleash your
[614.15 - 616.10] heads falling on her eyebrows are
[615.47 - 618.50] holding up
[616.10 - 621.38] you have vitiligo all of it is Radhika
[618.50 - 623.51] yes I know it's generating but the
[621.38 - 625.88] environment is triggering that will come
[623.51 - 628.73] at an early age so I have twenty to
[625.88 - 631.79] thirty words expressing skin disorders
[628.73 - 634.91] because they come by because they what
[631.79 - 637.10] food evening we come on crap so here's
[634.91 - 639.08] the thought process if you have a
[637.10 - 641.57] delicate darling stuff by the way I have
[639.08 - 642.17] already picked Alex now so I am very
[641.57 - 643.73] cautious
[642.17 - 645.56] I am NOT cautious of what a because I'm
[643.73 - 647.03] a nutritionist I'm cautious because I
[645.56 - 647.90] have a loop in it or inside when that
[647.03 - 649.52] goes in target
[647.90 - 651.65] I have a cut which is very sensitive to
[649.52 - 653.69] masala kisser and all of that stuff so I
[651.65 - 656.15] watch my food very carefully because
[653.69 - 657.95] guess what nobody is sitting with you in
[656.15 - 660.23] the forehead it makes money so you go to
[657.95 - 662.06] the party lately this drink that whole
[660.23 - 663.50] you can have four pegs of whiskey but
[662.06 - 665.33] that purse is not sitting with you in
[663.50 - 666.05] the next one and if you know what I'm
[665.33 - 668.54] talking about
[666.05 - 671.42] you have a gut problem because you face
[668.54 - 672.02] it every day so this presentation is to
[671.42 - 675.26] help
[672.02 - 678.23] it will understand that yes if you come
[675.26 - 681.74] on No what is there your blood your
[678.23 - 685.19] genetics to die all of these things can
[681.74 - 688.15] smoothly begin to be cut by the baby
[685.19 - 690.88] successfully rooted contribution okay so
[688.15 - 693.14] what what is the stain that come on
[690.88 - 695.45] might simply have difficulty
[693.14 - 697.94] conservation anxiety depression we see
[695.45 - 700.04] this as a Dulles candida overgrowth this
[697.94 - 701.66] is a East infection artistic correct on
[700.04 - 704.18] the his foot way I know you have a
[701.66 - 706.31] candida infection vaginal discharge this
[704.18 - 708.74] is the candida infection so given a
[706.31 - 710.78] Canada it meets your cup has gone over
[708.74 - 718.31] balance the acid-base balance is gone
[710.78 - 720.62] for a cross and this is this is very
[718.31 - 723.79] interesting of you because in terms of
[720.62 - 726.31] asthma okay you've done some awesome
[723.79 - 733.00] there's one thing I've known about
[726.31 - 736.79] asthma increases the ESR and information
[733.00 - 739.70] if the information is satisfy her the
[736.79 - 741.95] person will get for asthma attacks how
[739.70 - 744.41] do you get lesser house my dad's role in
[741.95 - 746.30] the country meet you've got stronger the
[744.41 - 748.61] immunity system goes up when the immune
[746.30 - 751.67] system goes are you have a better
[748.61 - 753.92] tolerance or than had other triggers an
[751.67 - 755.45] awesome awesome but even headaches
[753.92 - 758.63] running to the gun
[755.45 - 761.09] clearly I had case vision she had
[758.63 - 764.18] chronic migraines for her entire life
[761.09 - 767.66] Timmy's three weeks on a nutritionally
[764.18 - 771.40] balanced lack of genetic tests came by a
[767.66 - 775.04] severe it was linked to a nutritional
[771.40 - 776.25] deficiency and put in the wrong wrong
[775.04 - 778.50] foods in
[776.25 - 780.54] according to the wrong foods kind of get
[778.50 - 783.96] the headache and the lack of good
[780.54 - 786.30] nutrition help her from not tackling
[783.96 - 788.79] that migraine manifesting little severe
[786.30 - 790.20] headaches so please remember you have a
[788.79 - 793.29] lot of headaches you're having
[790.20 - 797.93] constipation these are all linked gut is
[793.29 - 801.14] deep the brain so this one here to that
[797.93 - 801.14] one slide
[809.96 - 812.59] so
[814.67 - 819.77] I'm going to give you today and if
[818.00 - 824.72] you're watching you see you glutamine
[819.77 - 827.60] box they were in the gut lining but they
[824.72 - 829.61] couldn't mean without a proper medical
[827.60 - 831.08] direction fancy one you don't know when
[829.61 - 833.60] to give it and perhaps the key but
[831.08 - 835.25] that's the cause of building so you have
[833.60 - 837.38] to work with the nutritionist will
[835.25 - 839.12] Google scrutiny completely of that
[837.38 - 841.25] planning basically your gut lining
[839.12 - 855.77] absorption of it gets better
[841.25 - 858.41] so this is our the most number of cases
[855.77 - 863.09] that we technically may get something on
[858.41 - 866.00] a team if the box with all the ideas now
[863.09 - 872.12] in the ideas the most important thing
[866.00 - 873.49] that I have seen is cebu cebu is small
[872.12 - 875.63] intestinal bacterial overgrowth
[873.49 - 878.00] disparate is that not so perfect even
[875.63 - 879.92] but for some strange reason bacteria
[878.00 - 881.99] from the nodule in the Sun is down there
[879.92 - 884.90] starts climbing back and going up and
[881.99 - 887.57] infecting the simple sweet blue thing
[884.90 - 890.21] bloating is a key sign of sumo you might
[887.57 - 894.83] do a test on each finally and you might
[890.21 - 896.66] see that you've got that why does this
[894.83 - 901.48] happen it happens because of erratic
[896.66 - 905.11] companions wrong put in your body and
[901.48 - 909.08] the Egypt give your body for example
[905.11 - 910.85] both made God we don't know be correct
[909.08 - 912.77] move because of God be careful mountain
[910.85 - 915.32] is dead curve that curve means it's
[912.77 - 917.84] passionate there's no bacteria here if
[915.32 - 919.31] they allowed curd with that to manage
[917.84 - 920.96] the portlets and the packages will
[919.31 - 923.63] explode in the supermarket because of
[920.96 - 926.15] the sonication by the bacteria which
[923.63 - 927.53] would produce gas and make the cover of
[926.15 - 933.29] water or whatever who Oh
[927.53 - 934.73] kaboom but because but more good
[933.29 - 936.86] bacteria do you want to get the good
[934.73 - 938.84] bacteria stopped making garden make sure
[936.86 - 940.61] that goes it goes red when you can make
[938.84 - 942.20] that go speaker how goes the secret
[940.61 - 945.61] recipe how to make that purse we could
[942.20 - 947.75] email us if you want that listen okay
[945.61 - 952.94] then the next thing I wanted to show you
[947.75 - 955.73] is nobody talks about okay I am doctor
[952.94 - 957.26]  what does doctor she - it means
[955.73 - 959.93] when somebody comes to me
[957.26 - 969.59] the first question ask them like hello
[959.93 - 970.25] mister X Y Zed how is your party do you
[969.59 - 973.13] go to the toilet
[970.25 - 975.47] yes I do because the same time they know
[973.13 - 976.64] I don't know yes I do when you see if
[975.47 - 980.09] happen to be or do nothing
[976.64 - 982.01] what's your what you like is it like you
[980.09 - 984.26] know make a gooey kind of thing like
[982.01 - 988.49] this or is it form like this which looks
[984.26 - 990.74] like a Snickers bar or is it small
[988.49 - 992.72] the season what a twins nobody ever
[990.74 - 995.00] talks we have discovered in our colony
[992.72 - 1007.54] I've got my new rules technically what
[995.00 - 1011.26] the husband what he did nobody discusses
[1007.54 - 1013.36] matter so what he is very very personal
[1011.26 - 1014.89] but let me tell you something when you
[1013.36 - 1016.72] come to a nutritionist if you know a
[1014.89 - 1018.22] nutritionist is freaking not asking you
[1016.72 - 1020.65] about your father movement and how does
[1018.22 - 1024.10] your power of what he look like
[1020.65 - 1028.24] useless nutrition first of all but was
[1024.10 - 1029.41] there too what is a shine who asked you
[1028.24 - 1030.70] a hot air to embarrassed
[1029.41 - 1034.09] I have not advanced how's your morning
[1030.70 - 1036.43] today the Pope was it steady right if it
[1034.09 - 1038.32] was Spain did it smell the bathroom the
[1036.43 - 1041.23] De Smet the bedroom the wooden of the
[1038.32 - 1043.66] old cause now they do me and if
[1041.23 - 1045.25] your heart is there okay you win the
[1043.66 - 1046.87] kids so that's your partner to be the
[1045.25 - 1049.00] room should not spend which leads my
[1046.87 - 1051.28] body my car to my system is good
[1049.00 - 1053.50] what fix things up what did I eat which
[1051.28 - 1056.26] might appear did not like we start
[1053.50 - 1058.54] fermenting that and reduce obnoxious
[1056.26 - 1061.66] smells so there are not things that you
[1058.54 - 1065.41] can discover by just asking about body
[1061.66 - 1066.91] so if your body is on the smaller side
[1065.41 - 1069.58] and liquid side and you're going three
[1066.91 - 1071.65] four times a day and there are not many
[1069.58 - 1073.51] 140 you sit on that throne and you
[1071.65 - 1076.15] finish it if you come off the balcony
[1073.51 - 1079.12] say I don't feel that that when I was
[1076.15 - 1079.90] new packet that's what into great bubble
[1079.12 - 1082.87] is a creation
[1079.90 - 1085.69] mother Kali Nene you feel that something
[1082.87 - 1088.54] is there a such people have got issues
[1085.69 - 1091.15] and they can be solved with proper fiber
[1088.54 - 1093.40] proper ignition of the food triggers so
[1091.15 - 1095.12] for example if you have rooted look at
[1093.40 - 1097.58] mix want to for you
[1095.12 - 1100.46] look at houses so meeting but we've been
[1097.58 - 1102.50] really rooted your body gets better but
[1100.46 - 1105.50] I don't say all of this in irritable
[1102.50 - 1108.92] bowel syndrome when you have frequent
[1105.50 - 1111.31] bowel evacuation of the obvious to take
[1108.92 - 1114.28] your hands away you can get -
[1111.31 - 1117.05] hemorrhoids or fistula which are leaders
[1114.28 - 1119.12] inside the bottom part of the understand
[1117.05 - 1120.92] so very very important a lot of things
[1119.12 - 1124.55] that we can do so I just want to show
[1120.92 - 1136.49] you I just want to show you what we do
[1124.55 - 1145.13] it so so basically if I can expand on
[1136.49 - 1147.77] this so I have a person without given a
[1145.13 - 1149.84] medical policy okay
[1147.77 - 1151.76] any meals you will see each it will not
[1149.84 - 1156.77] keep a diet this is not one case get
[1151.76 - 1159.32] hundreds of cases my team are like a
[1156.77 - 1161.57] record some of the book queens which
[1159.32 - 1163.49] means when you have a good Doug but if
[1161.57 - 1166.10] you have a good body the life is
[1163.49 - 1167.90] beautiful and people where irritable
[1166.10 - 1169.97] bowel syndrome are going to the toilet
[1167.90 - 1171.24] three four five six seven eight
[1169.97 - 1174.39] I'm sorry
[1171.24 - 1176.67] most of it so these people competency I
[1174.39 - 1178.86] have a little box and like okay this is
[1176.67 - 1181.23] the cheap Testaments video let's figure
[1178.86 - 1182.67] out the move first let's figure out the
[1181.23 - 1184.59] vitamins I mean is less figuratively
[1182.67 - 1187.77] mission how is your body for he is a
[1184.59 - 1189.96] founder let's look at even your bacteria
[1187.77 - 1190.95] by doing a stewardess a lot of people
[1189.96 - 1193.26] will try to do that
[1190.95 - 1195.30] in fact the latest now is the genetic
[1193.26 - 1197.37] analysis of the stories which is the
[1195.30 - 1199.71] part that's like the next level let's
[1197.37 - 1201.72] say going to mosque me right move never
[1199.71 - 1204.00] the money for my so I wanted to start
[1201.72 - 1207.39] asking for gene testing of your bacteria
[1204.00 - 1209.10] which is then enjoyed but that's that's
[1207.39 - 1213.99] also quite jokes apart let me come back
[1209.10 - 1216.75] to you what do we do okay we I hope the
[1213.99 - 1218.91] screen will be visible okay so we stop
[1216.75 - 1222.00] the different they come by the way I
[1218.91 - 1226.17] know some of you out there undoing
[1222.00 - 1228.60] populous please do not copy one size
[1226.17 - 1229.89] does not fit anybody enough if they will
[1228.60 - 1232.02] power center for all the diversity
[1229.89 - 1234.42] business watching you watching this and
[1232.02 - 1236.94] watching the car penetrating was next
[1234.42 - 1238.50] month you can register for it to keep
[1236.94 - 1240.03] you insights on how to good correctly
[1238.50 - 1243.15] just because you see I'll go every
[1240.03 - 1246.81] future go to City Hall and buy anything
[1243.15 - 1248.43] give it a minor miracle but it is enough
[1246.81 - 1250.11] of Google of there is enough for my
[1248.43 - 1252.06] mother out there there's enough of my
[1250.11 - 1254.47] auntie how there is enough of people are
[1252.06 - 1257.17] they tell me how
[1254.47 - 1260.17] be frickin go ahead study this for five
[1257.17 - 1263.32] six years of education life there's a
[1260.17 - 1265.98] process before coffee coming back so
[1263.32 - 1267.19] what we do we know the whole thing is
[1265.98 - 1270.07] better
[1267.19 - 1271.93] Who am I and the policeman under this
[1270.07 - 1274.12] title to go in this get word to the
[1271.93 - 1276.58] mouth then I put this man I know how
[1274.12 - 1278.80] this person drives your body and I know
[1276.58 - 1280.63] when it was in pure sama as a policeman
[1278.80 - 1283.45] I can control the traffic and how it
[1280.63 - 1287.32] comes out that's very very important so
[1283.45 - 1288.67] here's the thing okay and you see
[1287.32 - 1298.18] glutamine in the morning to be the
[1288.67 - 1300.52] summer so we've got breakfast timing
[1298.18 - 1303.16] we've got a supplement so I like to be
[1300.52 - 1305.92] so this person had out being a very
[1303.16 - 1308.53] complex deficiency do you know why I
[1305.92 - 1312.13] these people have vitamin deficiencies
[1308.53 - 1315.19] because the cut is so vanished so
[1312.13 - 1317.44] smashed up that the body cannot absorb
[1315.19 - 1319.48] anything which is very rare disease so
[1317.44 - 1321.52] over a period of time it starts at ideas
[1319.48 - 1322.93] people don't talk about it then they
[1321.52 - 1325.00] start getting become they start getting
[1322.93 - 1326.77] headaches that they start painting and
[1325.00 - 1328.99] it subtly give me problems then you
[1326.77 - 1331.36] start losing weight so everything
[1328.99 - 1335.56] happens in movies they talk about it
[1331.36 - 1337.90] so these are things that we do okay now
[1335.56 - 1340.57] when we choose fools there's something
[1337.90 - 1342.91] afford map there are only certain foods
[1340.57 - 1345.87] on the planet that you can choose and
[1342.91 - 1345.87] the servant
[1347.93 - 1351.01] [Music]
[1353.06 - 1356.81] there are certain foods on the planet
[1354.65 - 1359.32] which you can use which is nice coconut
[1356.81 - 1361.70] add to cover so these are the foods
[1359.32 - 1364.07] these are the foods that you can choose
[1361.70 - 1367.22] okay these are all these are all the
[1364.07 - 1371.18] foods that you can choose which are
[1367.22 - 1372.92] thick mark in ideas you cannot have any
[1371.18 - 1375.86] other than this one so it's almost like
[1372.92 - 1377.75] a prison sentence gravity so I guess
[1375.86 - 1380.27] people when they come to us we literally
[1377.75 - 1381.92] put them into a prison sentence saying
[1380.27 - 1383.80] that for the next six months this is the
[1381.92 - 1386.27] only things
[1383.80 - 1388.64] what about tip for people and I guess
[1386.27 - 1390.92] you can use a peppermint oil and I'm
[1388.64 - 1393.08] giving you the secret over 50 to 70
[1390.92 - 1396.50] milligrams the comment I'll help Scott
[1393.08 - 1398.51] with that but this is taken I'm gonna
[1396.50 - 1400.19] give you the secret but if you share my
[1398.51 - 1403.91] page and I give you the secret do not
[1400.19 - 1407.69] share her page okay listen let's go
[1403.91 - 1411.02] through the members of a campaign so I
[1407.69 - 1414.32] wanted to show you this is this is the
[1411.02 - 1416.81] stuff that we do by the way this one for
[1414.32 - 1419.39] you if we get all their sesame we get
[1416.81 - 1421.13] the 90 recall we take everything
[1419.39 - 1422.54] possible the nights with these likes of
[1421.13 - 1424.55] the person is what supreme if they were
[1422.54 - 1426.47] eating what foods are the others it you
[1424.55 - 1428.27] and you look at the food chain with what
[1426.47 - 1430.28] time you wake up what don't you see all
[1428.27 - 1432.68] of these things are then the person goes
[1430.28 - 1434.24] to college travel time shows us all some
[1432.68 - 1436.88] time breakfast what time what do they
[1434.24 - 1438.47] have all of this is what they did is
[1436.88 - 1440.54] that they are tweaked by the way these
[1438.47 - 1443.78] states are solid one and a half is is to
[1440.54 - 1446.11] get out of here so when people medical
[1443.78 - 1446.11] doctor
[1446.56 - 1452.11] today's for a place of all we are not
[1449.23 - 1454.21] with medication food is our medication
[1452.11 - 1457.93] who takes a lot of them for us to do all
[1454.21 - 1460.65] of these things okay so these are the
[1457.93 - 1463.15] supplements
[1460.65 - 1463.48] these are supplements and I'm okay with
[1463.15 - 1467.11] it
[1463.48 - 1468.85] ignition I'm working with glutamine and
[1467.11 - 1470.77] look at my utility how I'm giving the
[1468.85 - 1472.69] hose it at different times of day I'm
[1470.77 - 1474.46] working on a probe I become look even
[1472.69 - 1476.26] liquorice extract I'm working on
[1474.46 - 1478.51] digestive enzyme I'm working on aquatic
[1476.26 - 1481.06] requires a specialized provided I'm
[1478.51 - 1483.13] walking with zebra which will help here
[1481.06 - 1485.05] the micro black st. is one thing in
[1483.13 - 1487.09] Geneva noble security because the whales
[1485.05 - 1489.70] definitely bitter Brittany did you know
[1487.09 - 1491.80] between D zinc of testosterone the
[1489.70 - 1493.99] structure they do regeneration of cells
[1491.80 - 1496.59] and between these also link your immune
[1493.99 - 1499.60] system which helps protect against the
[1496.59 - 1503.53] attack of the micro boluses all neck
[1499.60 - 1505.75] interconnected super foods that we give
[1503.53 - 1508.39] our clients G da water that was very man
[1505.75 - 1511.18] or HDV Apple as for the format the
[1508.39 - 1514.96] weather rig that will sleep now all of
[1511.18 - 1518.92] this if you see is represented in the
[1514.96 - 1521.68] diet chart that we Democrat even lambda
[1518.92 - 1525.73] protein cops everything so if you see
[1521.68 - 1530.02] over here you see over there this is the
[1525.73 - 1534.07] lab job and we knew every meal can you
[1530.02 - 1536.86] see this I can actually tell you in
[1534.07 - 1538.95] every meal that I'm giving you what is
[1536.86 - 1543.48] the what is the person
[1538.95 - 1545.93] age of course over here 81% and I'm
[1543.48 - 1549.30] getting seventy one point eight grams
[1545.93 - 1550.08] okay at six point four in terms of
[1549.30 - 1553.23] calories sorry
[1550.08 - 1554.85] and 2.5 liters of protein so at the end
[1553.23 - 1555.93] of the day I ain't even knowing how much
[1554.85 - 1558.18] my penis
[1555.93 - 1565.41] so the possibly twice on this whole
[1558.18 - 1567.57] basis that was every meal and then this
[1565.41 - 1569.04] is the whole day planner so that we'd be
[1567.57 - 1571.77] good for anything over say Friday
[1569.04 - 1574.83] Saturday so it's a prison sentence based
[1571.77 - 1576.48] on what to eat what not to eat and seven
[1574.83 - 1578.90] days a week and we started with the
[1576.48 - 1582.99] supplement and starting any process so
[1578.90 - 1585.39] the ideas case philosophy in coefficient
[1582.99 - 1588.45] is not something that is taken very
[1585.39 - 1590.96] lightly it comes in a premium yes we are
[1588.45 - 1596.10] one of the most expensive
[1590.96 - 1600.03] we have successfully soared cases that
[1596.10 - 1602.16] the medical terminology they say that
[1600.03 - 1605.55] only medication and oh goodness
[1602.16 - 1607.65] it's easy simple logic if medicine
[1605.55 - 1609.03] didn't exist for the last 300 yrs how
[1607.65 - 1615.42] did people
[1609.03 - 1618.75] in consequence if you talk to me so I
[1615.42 - 1621.18] need this thought with you that if you
[1618.75 - 1621.87] know somebody who hasn't irritable bowel
