[133.84 - 136.56] um
[134.96 - 137.92] a tip to anyone who's watching this
[136.56 - 140.00] right now because i can't see it right
[137.92 - 142.72] now it's custom streaming live
[140.00 - 145.12] from the zoom to linkedin and
[142.72 - 146.48] facebook a tip
[145.12 - 149.04] if you breathe through your right
[146.48 - 149.04] nostril
[150.72 - 156.96] that activates your heart adrenal and
[154.24 - 158.40] basically warms up the body so
[156.96 - 161.12] if you get up in the morning you want to
[158.40 - 162.80] kind of focus on
[161.12 - 164.80] okay my nose is blocked today because i
[162.80 - 166.88] think i ate gluten so i'm not supposed
[164.80 - 169.04] to eat gluten and i ate a cake and so
[166.88 - 171.28] i'm suffering the consequence of more
[169.04 - 175.28] mucus secretion
[171.28 - 177.44] so i got i got my one nostril block
[175.28 - 180.00] my left is clear now if you bury through
[177.44 - 181.92] your left it calms the body down so
[180.00 - 183.68] towards the evening after a very
[181.92 - 185.84] aggressive day at work and all you want
[183.68 - 185.84] to
[186.08 - 189.28] take a breath
[187.84 - 190.64] through your left nostril and i'm
[189.28 - 192.96] working with
[190.64 - 195.44] my yoga guru arjun lal
[192.96 - 197.68] and he's gifted me this book called
[195.44 - 199.36] breath by james nestor you got to get
[197.68 - 200.96] that book it's like really really
[199.36 - 202.40] amazing
[200.96 - 204.72] it'll change your life in terms of the
[202.40 - 205.64] way you breathe and you have to have
[204.72 - 208.56] about
[205.64 - 209.52] 5.5 breaths per minute
[208.56 - 211.12] so it's
[209.52 - 212.96] it's literally like
[211.12 - 215.84] you know you're breathing in very very
[212.96 - 218.80] slowly and uh i've been experimenting
[215.84 - 220.96] with this uh on the garment and checking
[218.80 - 222.64] my heart rate as i worked out i did it
[220.96 - 224.56] actually today just came in for my
[222.64 - 226.40] workout
[224.56 - 230.00] and i found that my heart rate
[226.40 - 231.92] variability between the peak of a 155
[230.00 - 233.92] and then i finish a set and then i do
[231.92 - 236.96] the structured breathing only through
[233.92 - 239.52] the nose was like amazing
[236.96 - 241.20] um amazing to the extent there was this
[239.52 - 244.40] research done and that's what motivated
[241.20 - 244.40] me to start in the gym
[244.96 - 249.36] sealing up my lips
[246.80 - 251.36] so seal up my look
[249.36 - 252.64] and breathe only through the nose
[251.36 - 256.08] and why am i going to be talking about
[252.64 - 258.32] this on the first of january because
[256.08 - 259.84] all your fat burning doesn't happen from
[258.32 - 262.00] your diet
[259.84 - 262.96] it happens from breathing and when you
[262.00 - 264.40] walk
[262.96 - 268.40] you breathe
[264.40 - 270.00] at a rate which is so amazingly slow as
[268.40 - 271.44] compared to when you're
[270.00 - 273.52] running on a treadmill so i want to
[271.44 - 274.96] bring up a new concept to everyone and i
[273.52 - 276.40] want you to try this out i want to try
[274.96 - 278.48] it for three months get your fat
[276.40 - 280.40] percentage get your resting heart rate
[278.48 - 282.64] breathe through your nose the research
[280.40 - 285.04] that convinced me to do this is this
[282.64 - 287.28] this guy i forgot the name of the doctor
[285.04 - 289.12] he put everyone on a treadmill cyclist
[287.28 - 290.16] on a cycling treadmill or whatever it's
[289.12 - 291.12] called
[290.16 - 292.80] and
[291.12 - 294.72] he told them breathe through your mouth
[292.80 - 297.52] so they con they covered a certain
[294.72 - 299.04] distance in 44 breath
[297.52 - 300.72] holy threw them out
[299.04 - 303.92] and then he told them the next day
[300.72 - 303.92] breathe only through your nose
[304.32 - 308.84] the cyclists covered the same distance
[306.40 - 311.36] in 14 breaths
[308.84 - 313.84] so that was an amazing piece of
[311.36 - 316.72] information for me to receive because
[313.84 - 318.16] if i want to get a hack done in 2022 for
[316.72 - 320.56] my body and i'm going to be talking to
[318.16 - 322.40] dr ashish contractor and shwetambri
[320.56 - 324.56] about what they do in fitness and what
[322.40 - 327.52] they do in cardiac
[324.56 - 329.36] cardiovascular efficiency
[327.52 - 330.56] we're going to get different schools of
[329.36 - 332.40] thought
[330.56 - 334.40] but at the end of the day i want you to
[332.40 - 335.60] be able to ask the questions to the
[334.40 - 337.60] experts
[335.60 - 340.56] so join us on
[337.60 - 341.68] first of january at 5 pm i chose 5 p.m
[340.56 - 344.64] because if you're partying the previous
[341.68 - 347.20] day you'll probably have a hangover 5 pm
