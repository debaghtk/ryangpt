Transcript: our celebrity nutritionist whom we are glad to have amongst us [Applause] understand if the entire country had to have intelligence and Technology built into our roadways do you think it will be a pleasure to drive in [Music] India being an exceptionally focused individual because AI will beat us hands down any day students no longer need to be Geniuses because the world of competition has arrived 2,000 years from now if this recording is somewhere I still feel uh spaceships are going to be piloted by a captain but it'll all be run by AI but AI will not be able to defeat us on one quotient and that is called the emotional quotient you all in this room may have one day wanted to become a doctor I wasn't smart enough to become a doctor I didn't even get into engineering I got into BC microbiology and biochemistry but screw it I am changing people's lives because I choose to take a work load and change somebody's life because it beats any paycheck at the end of the day so work to change lives don't look at workload my friend our celebrity nutritionist whom we are glad to have amongst [Applause] usology sence science I think I don't need any other introduction over to you for thank you thank you hi everyone good afternoon how are you guys um I was given a topic that had me to do a lot of uh um research to make the presentation and the presentation came uh to me I don't know if it even will come up whether it's valid and stuff like that I'll just leave my laptop over here one second do you guys want to slide on top or you want me to speak speak speak was there was some nice AI slides made by my team um mul if you can get those air slides up for me it was on a pen drive if it comes over here okay so this is where technology fails and human skill comes so what's my lecture about technology and Innovation uh and stuff like that uh for those of you who do not know me in this audience my name is Ryan Fernando I am a nutritionist I probably have today one of the largest nutrition clinics in the country with 150 dietitians I started with two dieticians thank you so much and I have competitors who have larger clinics but they use uh artificial intelligence to run the programs of Wellness for the end consumer now many of these companies are funded I am not funded uh and so today when I when I did decided to speak it's it's kind of uh it's kind of not my story but your story uh and how does this go I just want to know in this audience how many of you all are in the wellness space or will go into careers of Wellness raise your hand almost 70% all right uh the reason I asked this question is this is this presentation is very relevant to your future and I see very young faces over here um today's newspaper 9 crores of fine was collected on the Bangalore my highway how much 9 crores what did they what did they do the police was not stopping people right how did they collect the fines cameras what is camera highspeed camera it was catching people without seat belts technology is making the cops feel really happy right 9 Crowes of fine in 2 weeks okay so where were we you driving on myour Highway and you get fined what's the basis of this lecture if the entire country had to have intelligence and Technology built into our roadways do you think it will be a pleasure to drive in India absolutely yes 9 crores of fine would be found in 1 minute in our entire country and within one year people would stop breaking the rules why because like me I one day had to drive my car it was two days my driver went on leave and I broke the signal on both days cuz I was thinking about somebody's diet chart and driving and the signal is going to turn red it's okay it's going to turn red so the moment I got that fine what happened was I began to recognize that that signal has a camera so I am going to stop First St human behavior you'll understand I know a lot of you paid money or something or come from a long way what's the relevance technology so today when I work in my clinic I'm always asking this question how can I get a better diet chart I worked with Amir Khan I worked with uh Shahid kapor vat kohi blah blah blah blah blah all the pro possible celebrities uh we built processes and systems in our nutrition clinic that range from genetic testing blood testing all of these things but do you know what 50 to 60% of the time we don't have the bandwidth capacity here to integrate it all so our generation those of you above 45 your time is done in terms of you will work in the old school and you'll be good at what you do because you have the experience but to anyone who's under 40 years of age in this room this is my first tip to you my first tip to you is become exceptionally brilliant human beings become exceptionally passionate about what you do in the wellness space it cannot be a 9 to5 job it cannot be a job it's a calling if you are going to counsel people in medicine ayura diet exercise physiology training Pilatus yoga whatever it is you do being an exceptionally focused individual because AI will beat us hands down any day but AI will not be able to defeat us on one quotient and that is called the emotional quotient as yet I somebody will pull this recording out 40 years later maybe an a pull it out and say look Ryan Fernando was wrong right but till such time I believe the emotional quotient of you is very important so I'll give you an example man first K you know killed his food and ate it then Community happened then some Elders were there and they told you know there is Tuli very good ashwag gandha is very good I started recommending to people then people like me came along okay we're like okay we nutritionist you need to follow this you need to do all of this and my reason for being invited here today was to say how good or bad is AI going to be for the future how is technology going to help us is it going to kill us so I'm just thinking I like the worst thoughts went through my head the robot realizes that I'm allergic to oranges and craftily Designs a super Biryani with orange extract in it now I know what all of you are thinking who puts orange flavor in a Biryani I'm playing with your thought process because you're a human and you've been able to identify that mistake I am putting scientific studies through AI it's helping me in clerical work currently it's not helping me in hard-hitting human thinking so I give you an example okay uh there's a study done on pomegranate juice and I remember reading it about 6 7even years ago and in one part I went wo this is amazing what was amazing cared intimida thickness for those of you who have a biology background cared artery there's a thickness and there's a scan that can be done on this artery so when you get plaque plaque is the deposits it begins to cut the size begins to become smaller and smaller so they found out that when they gave people I was even now I can't remember so I would have to use a computer to go to Google to search up the exact thing but you get when I'm going right I still need technology but the wo came from my brain which was reading which was when people took pomegranate extract with the seeds in it or pomegranate juice with the seeds Blended in the juice the cared intermedia thickness reduced by up to 35% after one year of daily consumption drainex in the human body so it helps you clear it up now I went to Ai and I forgot that study now can you imagine if I have to search for that study how much time it would take me I'd have to read article after article that Google would rank for me it'll be a 1hour job then find that research paper and remember that was the research paper then go to that so I told yeah to find it for me AI found about five more papers for me but I don't have the time to read those five more papers and I didn't know which favor so I I told AI I pulled out the PDF I banged the PDF into chat GPT version 4 I'm using the paid version I'm paying 2,000 Rupees a month and boom I said okay there's this paper find this for me I'm sorry we are not able to comprehend your request but it gave me four more articles so basically if there's a there's a win for AI and there's a loss for AI I'm actually waving both Flags to you in the center is the human being so people ask me about this personal diet or personal medicine or AI medicine have you heard of robotic surgery yes is a robot doing the surgery alone so in the world of Health preventive health I believe the opportunity for each and every Indian to have a job is massive where we will fail we will fail because we don't have what is known as uh respect to a career or job we think of it as a 9 to5 there is a Malik over there Malik the boss or the owner the entrepreneur organization oh but when you're an entrepreneur when you run your own business then you change your behavior but here's the problem conglomerates are going to move towards branding conglomerates are going to move towards Mass scale don't understand what I'm saying would you choose to go to a po clinic in your lane in indran nagar or would you choose to go to a poloo hospital or manipal hospital and that doctor runs a Polyclinic is also practicing in manipal and in aole my point here is this if you're looking to build your career I'm seeing very young faces over here if you're looking to build your career Ai and technology is going to help you become great but if you do not have the human quotient to practice practice with empathy with passion I'll give you an example today there I was listening into a call from by one of my dietitians and she like so that means sir you're telling me that you didn't take the multivitamin could there be a better way you could have framed that question it's okay sir you know you've take you've forgotten to take the multivitamin I'm sure you were busy but we'll do it the other way so emotional quotient is very important because was your scientific acument and I think I'm going to be trolled on the internet for this students no longer need to be Geniuses students no longer need to be Geniuses because the world of computation has arrived my 11-year-old son I want him to learn people skills visit the world social studies learn about history but when he asked me today Papa what's the distance between the Sun and the Earth I'm like let's Google it up why would you need to memorize that in a textbook so for those of you who are learning those of you getting into a job your memorization is not the key skill I take interviews of dietitians when they join a company of doctors when they join our company they like don't you want to ask me any technical question there is no technical question that cannot get answered today in under 5 Seconds depending on your Broadband speed so what am I looking for I am looking for Indians who have our traditional cultures of P up a p right the other day somebody walked into my office it was a ker guy I looked at my reception and I says and she's like looking at me then ler is like ma'am you need to offer a glass of water sir he's ker fellow are you getting my story have any of you ever visited Japan or watched Japanese videos there's a certain love for the profession that they do we are 1.3 billion people we are probably going to be outpaced by AI because conglomerates and entrepreneurs like me when you give me SAS and walk into my clinic I'm going to look at my HR manager subcription human skill trust me the world is going to go to Star Trek probably your children won't need to work then the governments will have to figure out who are lazy people who are creative people who are intelligent people and give them task to do because everyone will get a same same payment and the task that you do will give you fulfillment I meet people who are 50 to 70 years of age in counseling rooms and they searching for fulfillment Ro BB so please understand understand that Wellness Health Care is going to be a massive business in our lives I'm hoping that I influence you in this room to become what I have become which is a nutritionist who's very well known so people say oh you speak very well do you know why I speak very well because I have been doing from 8:00 in the morning till 8:00 in the night for the last two decades B so you get good at talking right but now when you do B B you got to back it up right so when you go back and watch a movie with your wife while she's watching the movie you're looking at a scientific study and you're reading the subtitles why because you're put on this Earth to change the way People's Health is could I influence you on that thought process stop looking at it as a job and you will get very successful because people will be attract raed to you I want to go and meet this person for their blood test for their medicine for their physiotherapy for their exercise for the yoga pil whatever it is you will have that vibration the next thing you know the whole family is coming to you the next thing you know you've gone from one room Clinic to five rooms the next thing you know you've hired four people plus chat GPT and AI to help you along the way so Advanced AI is going to come in and and it's not going to win because humans are lazy think about it exercise variables tracks my seep and everything Ryan Fernando you have done 1,759 steps today the technology has not enabled me to walk more it's only informed me that I have not walked enough are you getting my picture so all these companies that are coming out today are spending heavily on Tech and I know there are no VCS in this room right now but this is it if you enter into a company or a business of your own or join a company that is into healthare people real estate value is going to be the most valuable asset to convince somebody to change this Behavior where he did not even walk 2,000 steps so imagine if you call me up like sir how many steps you did today Madam I did only 2,000 steps so what happened actually today was a holiday you know I had to go for happiest Health seminar so I got up late in the morning I didn't do my exercise in the morning I called it a day I didn't wear my watch till 1:00 maybe that could be a reason huh but sir did you walk in the morning no I didn't walk in the morning why you didn't walk in the morning Madam today's holiday now I going to go and meet some people I'm going to stand the whole day okay sir tomorrow morning can you walk yes AI can't do that as yet and even if could do it you'd be like car but if the person is there you'll go back to your B hey look at my dieti how she's talking to me that is human engagement like or dislike love or hate and that component in healthcare wellness and which is why if you met some of the most successful doctors their bedside manner is the best in the world has anyone met DTI the best bedside manner in the world that guy is a god of bedside manner so what am I saying to you become the god of bedside manner in human emotional capital and use AI to become your business partner and that would make you the most successful at whatever you do my team has put all of this together I've got to read it out okay machine learning algorithm blood test they're bringing out algorithms cholesterol algorithm by the way I'm old school okay I studied at Goa Medical College in 1996 so for those of you are not yet born at that time then you know how old I am okay so machine learning algorithm we looked at cholesterol profile LDL vldl HDL triglycerides uh lipoprotein A lipoprotein B homoy tuck you looked at it boom why because we saw that many numbers so here's my next tip to you you are an algorithm I know the tech companies are going to build an algorithm to make your life easier but if you want people to go wow all you have to do is start taking the basic tenants of your profession and practicing it and especially the youngsters who rely on calculators 2 + 2 is equal to 4 that is AI for you but what if you know 2 plus two on your pen and paper the other person knows that this person has value maybe two generations down the line they will know that the AI is the person they need to turn to but this 90y old on the planet today till whoever is in this room your children will still trust a human being to give an opinion to give a therapy or to give a prognosis or prescription so the bottom line thread is you can have the best algorithms human behavior is a complex algorithm that we understand so practice more so I'll give an example up until last year I was doing 180 cases per year and it continued for 14 years my nearest colleague had the highest practice of 62 cases per year so 14 years later you understand the spread of experience so this goes to all you youngsters sir it's 5:00 in the evening I'll not get bus back home you got bus you got Ola you got car you got air conditioner you got electricity you got Netflix You' got swiy you've got zomato you've got what to complain our hardest day in our life today was the easiest day of your grandfather sorry did I say that right no no no no no no it's the opposite right see I I need an air to correct that right now but you getting where I'm going right the the the the most difficult day of our life our grandfather will be like a what man no AC to sleep under the fan oh you have no computer my father said once he went on a date with my mom he waited for her for 3 hours where are you I'm already here so use technology to your advantage by the way the variable Technologies are amazing in healthcare not because it's accurate I'm going to be shot by a few companies where I'm Consulting with but I've been very successful as a nutritionist because I use technology I'll give you an example I won't take names today I finished a very famous person in the morning and um he says okay I've done the microbiome test and I told him that he needed to avoid white right for the first two weeks and he said yes I'll follow it I'll do it the secret I wish to tell you is this if I had told him without an algorithmic data of testing his  his poop microbiome test for those of you who don't know what microbiome is it's found in the gut 1.5 kgs you can only analyze it by taking a stool sample stool meaning poop  so only after analyzing his  and I got his report of the DNA analysis of the bacteria in his gut and I told him that he shouldn't be eating white rice he said I'll I'll do it diligently for 2 weeks had I met him without the microbiome and told him you need to avoid rice idiot celebrity nutrition what he knows a full kandan eats rice all their life my grandfather D everyone ate rice why should I avoid rice so you got to figure out how to put all of this together um and this is the potential drawbacks of these diet apps or any apps that exercise apps and all I believe inherently only 5% of the human race will get up and punch you in the face those are the go-getters 95% of us are lazy right like I didn't do my workout today in the morning like I'm going for happiest Health My legs will hurt if I go on stage so I won't do my burpees push-ups nothing I want you to memorize or take photograph of these points because this is where you can make a difference to your life life your business okay lack of personalized guidance AI is not there as yet data security concerns dude if somebody gets my mobile phone I have probably at least 100 film stars and actors in there that's my biggest worry what happens when I have all their data online and it disappears or somebody takes it over Reliance on technology sir sir we're in Leela Palace uh sir one one client is arguing with us uh uh uh he his weight is uh 85 kgs normally the wing scale is showing 70 kgs are you in the balroom yes sir we in the balroom is the floor carpeted yes sir the floor is carpeted go outside find marble flow place the wing scale over there the wing scale will work correctly how do I know that the dean of Goa Medical College made me do 1,000 patients over 3 months Wing right stand take the wi and dude you have the electronic weighing skill we had that one whoever laughed in this room knows the weighing scale I'm talking about and which means you're old okay um I want to take some questions because I think it's all about you so let's take some questions and see if you've got value today uh by the way I've written a book called weightless and another book called eating secrets of champion so the best three questions that I get today will get a signed copy from you those fooks so who's asking the most non now don't go to Ai and ask ask Nando the best question possible how how does it work for questions over here just raise your hand if you have a question so is somebody going around oh they have individual mics how cool is your [Music] technology is there any questions that you want to ask me about nutrition in the previous one yes ma'am uh first of all I'm really excited to see you in person thank you your name please ma'am I'm Dr Keda nice to meet you Doctor nice to meet you I do follow your podcast and a huge fan of yours um so my first question uh is where is India in terms of Nutri genomics um are we are we you know still in the nent stage uh are or are we uh as um uh you know as advanced as the UK and the US so far um good question doctor I'll divide this question into two parts okay first part is we started that is my clinic started qual nutrition clinic started genetic neutronic testing in 2011 wow as early as then and we used to send the sample to the US uh we continue to be one of India's highest collectors of nutren tests and send it out because that's how I believe my practice should be run for example there was a question about gluten sensitivity in the previous and I think you mentioned hq8 and dq5 and the sensitivity now that's what we do so the question over here is India at 1.3 billion we are not even doing 01 of the population first thing but those that can afford it and those that are getting influenced and listening into podcasts and blah blah blah or have the knowledge are slowly asking for the genomic which is the nutrition Gene testing right uh I have an issue with the nutrition Gene testing from a lot of formats is that the data is predominantly Caucasian driven so the statistical set of population that is being analyzed to say that this Gene pair H dq5 is towards gluten sensitivity I could throw a spanner in the works and say that but that is from that end of the population having said that I am no scientist so what I did is I started testing sets of people saying sir this is not our data but can we do it and the people that come to me have the money so they said yeah it's okay we can we can afford it you know we go out to Mal and we spend like 10 times that amount we started doing this and then if we got a negative genetics we now recalibrated the behavior towards the which is the epigenetics yeah which is Diet exercise environment and the change was monitored in a 6mon diet plan onee diet plan and we saw fantastic um Transformations if you would like to call it as a result it transformed from Olympic level Superstars into my clinic and then that Olympic level Superstars is being trained by that um fitness trainer the fitness trainer bring starts bringing his Rich lifestyle clients and then those people start doing it and so we' have had a phenomenal amount of movement in the space so much so that recently Reliance Industries purchased TR genomics when they did that I went which means in the next 10 years we're going to be doing a lot of sequencing of the Indian population and that's going to help us and this very interesting over here doctor since you asked this question we marry within communities right so you have individual population sizes which could be like like uh you could do a PhD in a Goan population you could do a PhD in a Telugu population on one gene in wheat yeah there's so much of research potential available so I hope I've answered your question yes yes I just one followup question to the same thing this qu nutrition do anything in nutritional research like exactly like you said do we have a rigorous nutritional research Fraternity in India research at all is quite in India but how are we nutrition no so I've had limited money building CO nutrition not taken funding our research is mostly of talented dieticians and the team who go into the internet and do it but I can tell you that icmr and National Institute of nutrition the people that are there they are doing research is it at a level that Ryan Fernando would be happy I I would love to be the CEO of national ins nutrition and really push the envelope for nutrition research in India in two departments rural and urban so rural is where we have all the diseases which are from a lack of nutrition and in in in urban it's your metabolic issues and and stuff like that and that is a that is a bottomless bit so um maybe 10 years from now we'll start a research institute let's do that somebody over here will head it thank you thank you so much doctor a weakless book meet me afterwards lovely question any other questions anyone has a cat a taxi can leave okay yeah uh R my question very yeah my question to you is name sir yeah Arava from impeccable Innovations bang okay uh so we have been working with autistic kids a lot especially below 8 years of age so from your experience how is autism uh is it spreading very fast in India and what's your intake for the future of this children especially from nutrition point of so I don't have the statistical data on its predict but I'm assuming at 1.3 billion population we have a lot of clinically undiagnosed autistic children my experience is with autistic children in fact we have periodic nutritionist in our Clinic my first ever experience was my most memorable autistic case around 2011 uh and the girl had never spoken in her life at the age of eight and we uh sent her entire stool blood and urine sample to the US uh the lab was called uh genetic Geneva Laboratories and it's called the neutraal test that is like the Rolls-Royce of testing was ,000 test now why am I telling you this whole story when we began to change her diet because there's enough of research out there on gluten-free casin free and our Indian diet is loaded with gluten and casine casine is your paneer glut is your bread Roy and so we contaminated and autistic children before the ages of 12 will have a certain mouth field taste that they do not want to experiment with so if you try and be adventurous as a nutritionist they're going to shut you down they're used to something and then they throw tantrums and the parents can't take it so I have seen that girl in four months of a diet plan who had black stools because of huge amount of fungal infection in the stool say mama for the first time so for me that was proof in the pudding that Ryan Fernando whatever you're doing this group is there having said that I had an own neighbor of mine who had an autistic kid and I was like P you got to do this you got to do this you know you do the genetic test you need to do this you need to nut and the guy drives a highend vehicle where's a Rolex watch and didn't do it so the problem over here is parents are unaware that nutrition will have a sign significant impact on the development and the association of relationship I don't know what you call it but the interaction at human beings can be marred by bad nutrition and it's the parents responsibility to change the nutrition and in the affluent classes it's happening because the parents have the ability to learn but in poor India it doesn't happen and there's another problem parents in today's world are having accidental pregnancies which they shouldn't because they're having only one or two children they should have planned pregnancies which means the husband should not smoke drink or have coffee 3 to 6 months before they say they're going to try a baby so with the woman so when your diet is devoid of insecticides pesticides and all of these narcotics or Street Foods ptic uh Foods you're obese you're overweight people say how did I get an autistic kid I don't need to answer it but you know you see so many people coming in and then when you take a track record of what they did in the last 20 years and then when they conceive that's uh that's a whole thing actually the main thing the main problem is coming in our society is when we know that the child May recover but the parent is not able to imagine how can a nutrition improve a autistic child so that's the realization point is very low currently which is which is why um you know to be honest with you I don't need to do Instagram or podcast like my media team came and say sir do you want to become famous I'm like do have you seen my phone book the who who of the world have come to me but the reason we're going to the podcast because of this problem General India doesn't understand that as yet but the people who are very Elight have figured it out why do they figure it out they travel abroad they meet overseas experts they see Society over there so they come back like like women in India think you work out you you go to a foreign gym and watch foreign women work out it's a different level so so anyone who's gone abroad looks at the way people work out like dude I'm taking a stroll in the park so they change their workout the same goes for healthare in making parents uh realize you're talking about autism which is mandatory Sports Nutrition I want my kid to become vat kohi I want my kid to become K Rahul but parents are not willing to even understand with the internet what are the better foods to give their children so I think um of those of you who become parents in the future spend more time in educating your children what is right what is wrong don't give them sugar don't give them salt I think we could start with those Basics all of this neutr genomics and all of that stuff is like Star Trek for most people and they don't understand it and then you have this world of influencers today uh this is the biggest biggest problem today is that um and I can't take names but you will you should have this template in your head look for people who are qualified not certified what do I mean by that qualified means you went and studied that certified means oh you know my father spent so much for me to become an engineer and everything now I decided to do medicine so people are giving advice based on their wisdom of experience and I think that is where I have an issue so the creation of influence is important influence are important they should give you an awareness yeah Ryan today you have to walk more number of steps but when Ryan has to choose a physical activity he needs to go to a physiotherapist to look at his body alignment and everything rather than going to maybe a Gym trainer who will give me the exercise but has not yet assessed my body for the postural alignments any sort of biomechanical deficiencies etc etc so right now India is a free-for all country 1.3 billion everyone's doing expertise training in various subject matters I'm happy with the government of India because certain bills and acts are going to be passed where people need to be licensed so now once you have licensing you have to understand government will start pushing it so nutrigenomic testing will be pushed uh autism children testings all of these things will slowly happen I think we need to give 5 to 10 years and this will all happen next question I have 9 minutes left so my time I'm here it's a great point I think you covered quite a bit of it um and I'm a mom of three so I get what you're saying about nutrition for children and how much moms play an important role and also educating mothers um on a deeper level is very important and talking about AI one thing I I've noticed is like you know the chat box where you could say that give me nutrition plan or give me the meat plan so where do you see all the diti experts in nutrition other than the emotional ction aspect of it is it more of an accountability that they're going to stand for or more than that so I I think um when you look at like you said you know you download from chat p a diet plan uh in fact one of my business partners is doing it right now and he's actually laughing in my face like look dude it's just giving me a 7-Day Diet plan but what happens over there is is human motivation is easily lost I'm being recorded right so 15 14 years ago about this time I was pitching my nutrition clinics to at least about 35 40 VCS and I got rejected and shut down by every one of them saying that you know it won't work and then over the years you see all of these Brands come out with technology um various of them and now they're struggling they're laying off people they've taken funding they want to become a unicorn but they can't get it there I said to them 14 years ago whatever your technology Indians like Guru dakshana we love we love talking to somebody and getting advice from a person so my lecture was about you know um this point um which is what you've asked and I didn't play the slide optimizing nutritional roles AI so it's going to enhance not replace so whilst you do a diet plan with an AI the AI currently at this time by next year could change drastically the integration of what I do microbiome testing genetic testing all of that will begin to give you a blueprint a personalized blueprint but once you start doing that you'll realize that you want to go and meet somebody and be held accountable and my business experience is has been this billionaires millionaires Housewives moms working mom coo moms children everyone want to come like kids let's go meet Uncle Ryan on Saturday not because they want to meet Uncle Ryan in indagar because indagar is the best hot spot for restaurants in mangalo so after meeting Uncle Ryan they're going for the cheat meal but jokes aart I hold people accountable and after college your teachers and your principls hold you accountable with your marksheet then the only other person who holds you accountable is your company and your spouse most married people begin to ignore their spouses after 10 years the little bit of Giggles over here are those who are getting who are married okay so what happens is the AI component will not be able to hold you accountable my fitness SP healthy FY gabit all of these brands are coming out they're keeping people over there to hold you accountable and I recently interviewed four or five dietitians from a company that's shutting down dietitians and they saying PE people are saying sir we know the chart is from an AI but we want you to call us up which is what my beginning lecture was about human quotient so if that can come in it's great uh I've been recommending the whoop since the pandemic so many people like oh ver K is the whoop and everything recommend whoop so what's whoop whoop is one of the most sophisticated exercise variable bands it doesn't even have a digital screen on it so it'll give you everything from your heart rate your strain everything possible the insights you get on that integrated to a dietitian so I'll give you an example I had a um 70-year-old man who was not sleeping well and on the whoop we figured out what was the problem so we realized that when he was working out he was getting a peak heart rate so we asked him to meet the cardiologist card cardiologist did a battery of test and said that XY Z was an issue the changeed some medication they asked him to not exercise at that level his sleep changed so I think that's where technology is going to go and 2,000 years from now this recording is somewhere I still feel spaceships are going to be piloted by a captain but it will all be run by AI at the end of the day I hope I've answered your question thank you yes sir hi I'm Dr from happiest he my question is like uh do you think that AI will be useful in designing tyes for the people who are living who you can say who are staying in the hospitals especially in the icus on the for a long period of time um I run a nutrition clinic so I'd like to think that won't happen because then my business will go down but jokes apart the correct answer or the most scientific answer it it needs to happen my thinking comes from the logic that apparently AI has been able to scan in trauma patients who come in the uh CT scans and a doctor has experience of maybe about 7 to 10,000 CT scans in a trauma unit but AI could scan all the CT scans which could be as much as 2 billion and within 4 seconds give you the most practical uh funneled version of what medical trials decision you need to take so I believe that in hospital care uh the dietician would be available for her bedside manner like the doctor is available I was very disappointed when Google Glass disappeared because my thought process was I would be talking to you right now and my glass would be going to say this say this say this say this say this right that's what's going to happen in hospitals and I know the people that are doing it already so you can expect in the next four or 5 years uh many doctors who are not keeping Pace are going to get affronted by technology so you're going to see a rapid change of the Old Guard 60 plus year old doctors improving their bedside manner because the younger generation is relying on technology so they'll be in the trauma cases medical cases urgent care but people who need preventive care like r Fernando 70 years old hello doctor how are you so my BP is a little so this is what's going to happen in our universe right now I hope I've answered your question so there's an important question how do you see this where hi how do you see this effective mental health as we know that um how do I see technology affecting mental health oh it's already affected us have you seen any teenager today have you seen anyone on a flight have you seen human interaction people are in their phones I was on the Metro the other day and I was like everyone think I'm like hi I'm Ryan Fernando nobody's looking up you got a free counseling with me you could just say Sir hi what do you think about this time I'm like yeah yeah I'm from the old generation where we talk mental health is getting affected limit your mobile phone um talk to your family friends go out have a bag all the friends put the mobile phones together and for 1 hour talk I think that's where the mental health problem is coming in I'm I'm Psychotherapy and a behavior specialist and it's very very difficult nowadays to convince like he said what you're looking for is the basic manners the courtesy asking for water even today when when I have a speak Z come I offer something or even if it's a packet of biscuits or something that's wonderful I just these values I'm also going to start doing that but I'll not do packet of biscuits maybe I'll give him cucumber he'll probably throw the Cucumber back at me his mental health would say Throw throw the Cucumber back so I I want to take your question a little deeper now that you've identified what you do and what you practice and and forgive me I I you you you have permission to troll me in Psychiatry the one organ that is involved the brain is a least scanned so I believe that going forward the future of your pet scans of the brain the biochemistry of the blood test the neurotransmitter detection in diagnostic test and your gut microbiome which eats the food and dumps molecules back into your blood which go and affect your brain are all going to be your technologically um uh researched or diagnosed things and then you'll get like I get that opinion so what I did 20 years ago was organize the dietetics and nutrition space where everyone said to idly to S to Dosa I started with blood test genetic Test new your profession will go on that in that line so if if I were you and you were a team of people uh start looking at what Dr Daniel aan is doing in the US uh a lot in terms of scan so patient like oh alcohol does that to your brain even one glass of alcohol yes that's your brain people stop drinking but when you say stop drinking or I say stop drinking nobody believes us because they can't see it so technology is going to help your pro profession have the tools to go boom in your face follow my plan next question yes ma'am the lady behind and then sir you up there anybody else questions my time is up anyone wants to leave the happiest mind people are like happiest H people are like no no no we want to go home right now it's Saturday who wants to party today no smoking no alcohol huh by the way you will live you would ladies one thing that I would tell all the ladies in this room smoking and alcohol affects your fertility if there is a fertility doctor in this room she will be able to tell you point blank the health of your eggs is in the diet that you eat so please follow that yes young man right there at the you raiseed your hand uh sir I am from AA background I just want to ask you regarding diabetes in today's s we have something called CGM unit CGM sensors so are the CGM really useful for we dietitians because when I applied the CGM units to my patients they get very excited very hyper after eating such food that my sugar level suddenly SP 300 and then I need to explain them about glycemic index and glycemic load what is actual difference between them so what is your opinion that is the CGM sensors useful for us or they are increasing our load i' I'd like to take a poll here because this gentleman is just answered his own question how many of you in this audience think the CGM which is a continuous glucose monitor device placed on the arm which is connected to your phone which will give you realtime reading of your sugar levels and by the way I put on one so how many of you believe it's going to be like absolutely amazing for you and your practice or on your body or on your parents please raise your hands maybe about 10% okay put your hands on how many of you think it's not going to help your practice okay there are a lot of fence sitters there another 10 so 80% Fitters let me give you my opinion young man two Christmases ago I put a CGM device on my hand why do I say Christmas cuz I got it on 23rd of December I'm not diabetic so Christmas Day uh something happened and some people didn't turn up so we ordered Biryani H bottle of champagne was there beta Biryani and bottle of champagne Ryan Fern is looking at his CGM not one Spike double spike it went up at 2:30 came down by 3:30 at 4:00 it went up so what I started doing I started eating or drinking orange juice pomegranate juice Papaya juice y juice eating it D do d d do and I was getting all of this now my dad is like sir but it is not in the blood level no sir it is in the arm it is the not it is the inal it is not very accurate I'm like Baba it has now given me what awareness my dad I gave it to him he's like I put this in ragi porridge is giving me a spike last 20 years my doctor told me to have ragi porridge for diabetes dad your doctor did not meet your mother your mother made Nash ragi porridge hand pound so the fiber was still there what you lazy B did you went to shop and bought powdered ragi high glycemic index it will increase your workload but you're not doing a job beta you're changing lives so think about it you all in this room may have one day wanted to become a doctor I wasn't smart enough to become a doctor I didn't even get into engineering I got into BC by microbiology and biochemistry but screw it I am changing people's lives because I choose to take a workload and change somebody's life because it beats any paycheck at the end of the day so work to change lives don't look at workload my friend all right God bless you
