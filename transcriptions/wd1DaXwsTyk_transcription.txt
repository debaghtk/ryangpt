Title: Celebrity Nutritionist Ryan Fernando reveals the truth about bread. Is It good or bad?

Description: Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, giving bread its elasticity and chewy texture. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can trigger adverse reactions, including digestive issues, skin problems, and fatigue. As a result, many people opt for gluten-free bread alternatives, typically made from grains like rice, quinoa, or oats, to accommodate their dietary needs. Additionally, some individuals choose to avoid gluten for health reasons or as part of a gluten-free diet trend. It's important for those with gluten-related disorders to carefully read bread labels and opt for certified gluten-free products to avoid gluten contamination and ensure their dietary requirements are met.
