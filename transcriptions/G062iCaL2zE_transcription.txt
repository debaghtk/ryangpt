[78.08 - 83.36] hi doctor good evening how are you doing
[79.76 - 85.52] today hi Ryan I'm doing fine thank you
[83.36 - 88.16] was a very generous introduction let's
[85.52 - 90.84] talk about you first um in your school
[88.16 - 93.36] days how are you as a teenager sporty
[90.84 - 95.08] kid are there any rules that you made at
[93.36 - 98.32] that time that are still there with you
[95.08 - 100.40] see I was a very lean thin kid you know
[98.32 - 103.40] those days parents biggest problem was
[100.40 - 105.68] child doesn't put on weight and I was in
[103.40 - 107.24] a school where to play All Sports was
[105.68 - 109.76] compl you were punished if you didn't
[107.24 - 112.72] play oh and therefore we got into
[109.76 - 114.60] playing all sports like from baseball to
[112.72 - 116.92] basketball to football to hockey to
[114.60 - 120.00] Cricket so that was a very good three
[116.92 - 121.40] years 9th 10th 11th which I got and I
[120.00 - 123.64] think that stood with me throughout
[121.40 - 125.88] amazing and when you went into medical
[123.64 - 127.92] college did you have time as a medical
[125.88 - 129.40] student for doing your Fitness because
[127.92 - 130.96] everyone says when once you get into
[129.40 - 131.84] medical studies there's no time to do
[130.96 - 135.00] anything
[131.84 - 136.56] else yeah so first year I would play All
[135.00 - 139.04] Sports and then everybody said if you
[136.56 - 141.68] keep playing you can't study so I
[139.04 - 142.88] thought uh I should focus on exercise
[141.68 - 145.76] because one of my seniors he was a
[142.88 - 147.76] wrestler so I asked him give me tips how
[145.76 - 149.36] to build muscle how to get a good body
[147.76 - 152.24] and he said you actually have to have
[149.36 - 155.60] one L of milk and one kg of banana
[152.24 - 158.32] mangoes every day extra wow so I
[155.60 - 160.20] continued this for a month and exercise
[158.32 - 162.48] like mad and actually lost weight I said
[160.20 - 164.68] no this is not working for me but I
[162.48 - 168.56] think that got it in the head that you
[164.68 - 170.56] know you have to do that okay and um in
[168.56 - 173.04] terms of being a doctor and pushing your
[170.56 - 175.00] body and having lost weight and all over
[173.04 - 177.32] the years I know that you have you know
[175.00 - 180.20] you are a very very Fitness conscious
[177.32 - 182.72] person um did you have a trainer with
[180.20 - 184.56] you or my question to you would be how
[182.72 - 186.48] important is it for people to have a
[184.56 - 189.48] trainer you being a doctor how important
[186.48 - 191.44] is your guidance to the people out there
[189.48 - 194.00] that is there a requirement to have a
[191.44 - 195.80] trainer or not have a trainer yeah most
[194.00 - 198.84] people you will see they say why do I
[195.80 - 201.24] need a trainer I can exercise alone so
[198.84 - 203.96] that is not the issue one number one is
[201.24 - 206.20] the trainer corrects you he corrects
[203.96 - 208.48] your posture he remembers he takes a
[206.20 - 210.32] note last time what did you do today
[208.48 - 212.88] what you have to do so he maintains the
[210.32 - 215.24] schedule secondly he helps you
[212.88 - 217.36] especially in your last reps when you're
[215.24 - 219.28] tired you can drop the dumble or you can
[217.36 - 221.04] drop the barbell he's there to help you
[219.28 - 222.80] thirdly he makes sure you finish your
[221.04 - 224.48] workout and that is important because
[222.80 - 226.60] many times you know I'm in a hurry and I
[224.48 - 229.56] want to shortcut something and just do a
[226.60 - 231.84] little and run away no he will not but
[229.56 - 234.08] most importantly he will make sure that
[231.84 - 236.36] you follow a schedule and that is
[234.08 - 237.96] important speaking of shortcuts doctor
[236.36 - 239.48] which a lot of people who come to my
[237.96 - 242.48] nutrition clinic and you know they want
[239.48 - 244.56] to do a shortcut diet shortcut workout
[242.48 - 245.84] we're seeing a lot of injuries in gyms
[244.56 - 248.56] or death in gyms and I think the
[245.84 - 251.04] trainers help modulate this what is your
[248.56 - 253.52] advice as a doctor to people saying like
[251.04 - 255.84] don't go to the gym don't do aggressive
[253.52 - 259.44] workouts don't do all of these things
[255.84 - 261.24] about the uh how to go to a gym number
[259.44 - 263.84] one is that if I know that I have
[261.24 - 266.12] medical problems then I should consult
[263.84 - 268.56] my physician first and see what can I do
[266.12 - 270.56] what are my limits but what happens is
[268.56 - 274.56] most of the people don't know how to go
[270.56 - 276.84] about it like today cardio is most of
[274.56 - 279.84] the program that is just a warm up you
[276.84 - 282.16] cannot do cardio for 1 hour so 10
[279.84 - 283.80] minutes of cardio warm up and then you
[282.16 - 286.20] go on to strengthening exercises
[283.80 - 287.64] resistance exercises so most of people
[286.20 - 289.32] don't think because they're they're just
[287.64 - 291.48] doing what they've heard or see other
[289.32 - 294.48] people do secondly there are two types
[291.48 - 296.28] of trainers one is the younger ones who
[294.48 - 298.68] just you know bodybuilding and very
[296.28 - 301.64] young they think that you should be like
[298.68 - 301.64] them they'll say ha sir
[303.68 - 307.92] whereas then you have the other group
[305.40 - 312.12] which is mature which is like 40 plus
[307.92 - 314.24] they say Sir hold do slow you don't need
[312.12 - 316.48] to do more weights you do it carefully
[314.24 - 318.52] you do it slowly and I have a trainer
[316.48 - 321.72] fortunately who used to dealing with
[318.52 - 323.92] older people he restrains you he
[321.72 - 326.08] controls you he makes you do things
[323.92 - 328.00] slower he makes sure the technique is
[326.08 - 330.04] right he says weights will come don't
[328.00 - 332.16] worry but you get your Technique right
[330.04 - 334.64] your position right and your schedule
[332.16 - 337.68] right and that is what is important so
[334.64 - 340.12] Dr Kip is saying go slow even his
[337.68 - 344.24] trainers who are older say go slow
[340.12 - 345.68] correct rep range correct rep timing so
[344.24 - 348.08] I think the most important thing that
[345.68 - 350.36] people who are now hearing about Fitness
[348.08 - 353.04] a medical doctor is also advising that
[350.36 - 355.72] working out is good it's not injurious
[353.04 - 357.68] to your health go slow and steady and so
[355.72 - 359.76] that really helps you know I also
[357.68 - 361.60] studied in a medical college and you
[359.76 - 363.96] studied many years ago you look like a
[361.60 - 365.72] handsome young 40-year-old doctor but I
[363.96 - 367.92] remember when I studied in Med College
[365.72 - 371.60] in 1995
[367.92 - 374.16] 96 that nobody used the premises of the
[371.60 - 376.96] gym or the the what we called is the
[374.16 - 378.64] gymnasium those days it was empty right
[376.96 - 381.28] it was the support staff that you would
[378.64 - 385.16] use it at Goa Medical College what's
[381.28 - 388.68] your advice to medical students today in
[385.16 - 390.40] the fastpac mbbs degree if if you were
[388.68 - 392.96] there teaching them what would you
[390.40 - 394.88] advise them in seven days of a week when
[392.96 - 396.56] should they go what should they do and
[394.88 - 400.72] how quickly can they do a
[396.56 - 402.76] workout see I think uh some exercise
[400.72 - 406.52] should be done daily and that should not
[402.76 - 409.92] be in a gym necessarily so and three
[406.52 - 412.08] days a week at least you should work out
[409.92 - 414.24] and uh so the remaining three days you
[412.08 - 416.60] can just do brisk walking I'm okay with
[414.24 - 418.36] that 30 minutes of brisk walking is good
[416.60 - 421.32] the day you're not going to exercise in
[418.36 - 424.08] the gym the three days you go to a gym
[421.32 - 426.68] 10 minutes of warmup and then you do
[424.08 - 428.12] whatever exercise you do you so I had a
[426.68 - 430.88] trainer I'll tell you this when I
[428.12 - 433.12] started this was about 15 years ago who
[430.88 - 435.72] said sir every day your warm-up will be
[433.12 - 437.84] after cardio two sets of push-ups and
[435.72 - 440.24] two sets of squats okay so I have been
[437.84 - 443.24] doing two sets of push-ups for the last
[440.24 - 445.84] 15 years as my warm up every time I go
[443.24 - 448.48] to the gym and you know it opens up all
[445.84 - 450.84] your muscles and it is a good warm-up
[448.48 - 453.56] actually I spend more time in warmup and
[450.84 - 455.12] stretching than the actual exercise and
[453.56 - 456.36] as you get older that is important
[455.12 - 457.52] because what you have to do is
[456.36 - 460.72] injury-free
[457.52 - 463.88] exercise and that is important so warmup
[460.72 - 466.44] and relaxation later stretching are as
[463.88 - 469.08] important if not more doctor cuep you
[466.44 - 472.64] have inspired me because when I met you
[469.08 - 475.48] I had an ACL tear I'm 49 years old you
[472.64 - 478.56] know Dr cuep you have inspired me
[475.48 - 481.72] because when I met you I had an ACL tear
[478.56 - 484.52] I'm 49 years years 48 years old uh going
[481.72 - 486.96] on to 49 and you know when I met you you
[484.52 - 488.60] was like look at me I cycle I do so many
[486.96 - 491.32] kilometers more than 100 kilometers a
[488.60 - 493.48] week and you said I've had both my knees
[491.32 - 496.12] replaced and that was an inspiration
[493.48 - 497.92] because you continuing to exercise after
[496.12 - 501.60] having an injury and then getting it
[497.92 - 503.52] replaced so what's the what's the voice
[501.60 - 506.16] in your head what's the secret that's
[503.52 - 507.88] pushing you because you motivated me so
[506.16 - 510.48] how can we motivate people out there who
[507.88 - 513.60] are getting older 30 to 40 40 to 50 50
[510.48 - 516.12] to 60 or even 60 plus 70
[513.60 - 519.20] plus even if the body is hurting or
[516.12 - 523.44] injured you is a medical doctor who does
[519.20 - 525.48] surgery who replaces things in people uh
[523.44 - 529.00] why should we push the human body they
[525.48 - 531.00] say that food is the most abused
[529.00 - 533.24] anti-depressant and exercise is the
[531.00 - 538.28] least utilized one
[533.24 - 542.12] wow and that is because the relaxation
[538.28 - 544.12] and happiness and stress busting which
[542.12 - 546.72] exercise can get you nothing can
[544.12 - 548.92] parallel and it is one hour where I
[546.72 - 551.32] don't remember anything what I have to
[548.92 - 552.72] do whether my patients are there I
[551.32 - 555.40] finished my work for the day you take
[552.72 - 557.36] your phone into the gym uh I take my
[555.40 - 558.96] phone but it is lying in one corner and
[557.36 - 561.04] my trainer asked me sir should I bring
[558.96 - 563.44] it to you I said only if it says from
[561.04 - 566.64] the hospital otherwise just leave it but
[563.44 - 569.48] we have installed uh a direct line into
[566.64 - 572.12] the gym because I said if somebody has
[569.48 - 573.64] even a fainting spell you need to have
[572.12 - 576.12] something and that is another reason why
[573.64 - 577.64] you should have a trainer you are alone
[576.12 - 579.28] okay you have a fainting spell or God
[577.64 - 581.48] forbid if you have an epileptic have a
[579.28 - 583.48] seizure or maybe have an heart attack
[581.48 - 586.44] anybody can have there should be
[583.48 - 588.92] somebody who can call uh the emergency
[586.44 - 591.40] Cod blue in our hospital so or in the
[588.92 - 594.76] gym so you are actually a doctor working
[591.40 - 597.76] out in the gym in his own Hospital yes
[594.76 - 599.60] yes so what we did was that during covid
[597.76 - 602.00] there was time but we couldn't go to gy
[599.60 - 605.64] gyms were closed okay so we managed to
[602.00 - 608.64] convince our MD to open the a gym in the
[605.64 - 610.60] basement with the biometric access and
[608.64 - 612.92] only one person could go in at a time
[610.60 - 615.88] and sanitize it and my trainer was there
[612.92 - 618.40] with his double mask so so we would do
[615.88 - 620.44] that and uh we installed this phone so
[618.40 - 623.52] that code blue can be called if there is
[620.44 - 626.28] a problem and it is important so I I'll
[623.52 - 630.24] tell you another thing before that
[626.28 - 632.60] somewhere uh before covid uh we do what
[630.24 - 634.92] is called the primary trauma care uh uh
[632.60 - 638.56] training courses in our free time
[634.92 - 641.20] whatever that you may be so uh I got all
[638.56 - 644.12] the trainers from my gym 24 of them from
[641.20 - 646.68] talwalkar gym in Delhi two gyms and we
[644.12 - 649.48] trained them in primary trauma care so
[646.68 - 651.76] my trainer actually doctor for the UN
[649.48 - 654.44] uninitiated what do you mean by primary
[651.76 - 656.12] trauma care primary trauma care is
[654.44 - 658.88] suppose somebody gets an injury and
[656.12 - 660.76] falls down we think people in India
[658.88 - 662.28] don't help but that is not the problem
[660.76 - 664.92] they can't help because they don't know
[662.28 - 667.16] what to do and if you train them in that
[664.92 - 668.60] basic care how to approach the person
[667.16 - 670.40] call out his name make sure he's
[668.60 - 672.76] conscious make sure he's breathing make
[670.40 - 674.80] sure he has a pulse make sure he's and
[672.76 - 678.04] then if not then do a CPR call for help
[674.80 - 679.68] do CPR to resuscitate so this is a very
[678.04 - 682.08] basic thing and we teach it to lay
[679.68 - 685.28] people and I thought my trainers were
[682.08 - 687.24] the persons who should be knowing this
[685.28 - 689.96] and so all our trainers were trained and
[687.24 - 692.28] half the money for that raist
[689.96 - 693.88] the hospital subsidized and half the gym
[692.28 - 695.84] owner subsidized no trainer had to pay
[693.88 - 699.28] money for that but we trained 24
[695.84 - 703.32] trainers yes that's that's amazing um so
[699.28 - 706.36] talking about trainers and gyms and all
[703.32 - 709.88] um why do you
[706.36 - 712.16] cycle so uh when I had this knee problem
[709.88 - 714.00] first we used to play tennis okay so I
[712.16 - 715.28] had to give up playing tennis and I said
[714.00 - 720.12] I have to
[715.28 - 722.72] exercise so um I got a cycle and uh
[720.12 - 724.96] uh then I said I must start cycling so I
[722.72 - 727.48] started cycling was painless even with
[724.96 - 729.64] the knee problem even with patients with
[727.48 - 731.56] arthritis uh cycling is relatively
[729.64 - 733.16] painless and my Orthopedic Sur allowed
[731.56 - 736.68] it he said it improves gliding and so it
[733.16 - 739.72] is good so I started cycling and then my
[736.68 - 742.00] son joined me and then we would go to
[739.72 - 744.44] longer distance we made Loops one Loop
[742.00 - 746.68] bigger Loop bigger Loop so depending on
[744.44 - 748.68] your mood you would take that Loop okay
[746.68 - 750.72] so that was fun and we had a Midway
[748.68 - 753.28] break and take black coffee and then
[750.72 - 755.52] continue with our cycling so it was fun
[753.28 - 757.48] it was a good substitute for not playing
[755.52 - 758.92] tennis how old was your son when he
[757.48 - 763.60] started cycling with
[758.92 - 766.48] you so he uh I think he was around
[763.60 - 768.44] 28 so it's it's a great way for parents
[766.48 - 771.68] to bond with their kids in an exercise
[768.44 - 774.08] activity absolutely and uh it is good
[771.68 - 776.72] and it is fun and doesn't sound like
[774.08 - 780.00] exercise and uh we would do like a
[776.72 - 783.64] minimum of 20 km that was shortest Loop
[780.00 - 786.20] wow wow yeah so so we would do that yes
[783.64 - 788.60] so you know when we met in Mumbai and we
[786.20 - 790.80] were talking about your life and how
[788.60 - 793.88] you're the doctor that tells everyone to
[790.80 - 795.76] do a diet in the hospital come to me I
[793.88 - 797.56] will tell you what to eat how much
[795.76 - 801.08] protein to take and all and what you
[797.56 - 803.80] shared with me was so remarkable so um
[801.08 - 806.60] any any inspirational stories that you
[803.80 - 808.88] want to share with us as a doctor who
[806.60 - 812.56] works out ask people to work out and
[808.88 - 815.16] then you're also very very uh V iferous
[812.56 - 818.96] about diet being very important for your
[815.16 - 821.84] Fitness regime you know I am a big uh
[818.96 - 823.56] nuisance that way if I see somebody
[821.84 - 826.92] who's not taking care of himself or
[823.56 - 828.48] herself I will point out and uh so what
[826.92 - 830.16] happened we were in one of our meetings
[828.48 - 832.08] and I met this young lady she's a
[830.16 - 835.32] dermatologist from
[832.08 - 837.56] Bangalore and uh I said hey uh do you
[835.32 - 839.76] need advice because I primarily feel
[837.56 - 843.12] people don't know how to go about things
[839.76 - 845.32] do you need to uh help lose weight she
[843.12 - 847.92] said I don't want to talk to you then
[845.32 - 850.04] next day she came to me and said Dr kulp
[847.92 - 853.60] I think I want to talk to you so we
[850.04 - 855.84] discussed this was in August in one year
[853.60 - 858.48] and we went back and then we
[855.84 - 860.68] communicated on WhatsApp uh she said you
[858.48 - 863.64] have spoiled my food I can't have idlies
[860.68 - 865.44] I can't have this I said you slowly
[863.64 - 867.32] modify start with breakfast then we'll
[865.44 - 869.28] do lunch then we'll do dinner and
[867.32 - 872.40] gradually you will feel the energy once
[869.28 - 874.16] your protein intake gets to 60 gam a day
[872.40 - 877.40] you will have enough energy to start
[874.16 - 879.48] exercising so on New Year she sent me a
[877.40 - 882.88] email I talked to her today she said yes
[879.48 - 886.16] you can talk about me happy New Year
[882.88 - 887.20] happy new me wow and she had lost almost
[886.16 - 889.60] 15
[887.20 - 891.20] kgs and she was working and she said I
[889.60 - 894.28] think I must change my trainer because
[891.20 - 898.00] my weight is not going further down and
[894.28 - 899.68] uh she is 63 now from 80 kgs and
[898.00 - 902.00] continuing this and and she says every
[899.68 - 904.96] time I go cycling I remember you so
[902.00 - 907.12] there are some people who you manage to
[904.96 - 908.56] convince to change their lifestyle and
[907.12 - 910.20] they're looking for it you know they
[908.56 - 911.56] don't know how to go I say there are
[910.20 - 915.60] three things
[911.56 - 918.04] required knowledge resource and
[915.60 - 920.04] motivation three things are required and
[918.04 - 923.32] most of the people don't know these if
[920.04 - 925.16] you can fulfill these three needs uh
[923.32 - 928.76] most of the people will be on
[925.16 - 930.56] track that's that's amazing so uh you
[928.76 - 932.52] know you talked there's a nice point
[930.56 - 934.08] that I wanted to give as a takeaway you
[932.52 - 936.64] didn't tell a person do the whole diet
[934.08 - 938.92] at one shot first start with breakfast
[936.64 - 941.28] so you took one meal you broke down one
[938.92 - 943.68] challenge or one meal got it right then
[941.28 - 946.56] went to the next meal and would you say
[943.68 - 948.64] that you know whenever we advise diet or
[946.56 - 951.12] exercise to people they need to have
[948.64 - 953.60] patience of at least 180 days before
[951.12 - 956.36] they see something yeah because because
[953.60 - 958.60] I tell them see you cannot do it all at
[956.36 - 961.96] once and I what I do is I tell them to
[958.60 - 964.72] First mail me their diet their food
[961.96 - 967.52] diary for 3 days or 5 days I said I want
[964.72 - 969.48] to know how you eat so we can insert
[967.52 - 971.40] things into your food plan without
[969.48 - 973.56] disrupting everything because if I
[971.40 - 975.40] disrupt everything you can't sustain it
[973.56 - 978.72] so they send me the food plan we start
[975.40 - 980.64] with breakfast then lunch then dinner
[978.72 - 982.76] and then we are on to it so gradually
[980.64 - 985.08] and I still tell them every week or two
[982.76 - 986.32] weeks send me progress not about things
[985.08 - 988.96] you've been able to do even things
[986.32 - 991.48] you've not been able to do uh so and it
[988.96 - 993.52] it works and it even works long distance
[991.48 - 995.24] that's true that's very true I work with
[993.52 - 997.80] clients across the world with with the
[995.24 - 999.24] same methodology send me a food diary
[997.80 - 1002.68] tell me what you do tell me what you
[999.24 - 1005.40] don't do so I think there are some final
[1002.68 - 1007.44] very cohesive points over here that
[1005.40 - 1009.76] doing nutrition or doing exercise is no
[1007.44 - 1013.08] rocket science it's absolutely breaking
[1009.76 - 1015.72] down basic habits now speaking of habits
[1013.08 - 1018.20] and speaking of nutrition tell us some
[1015.72 - 1019.60] of your personal secrets that of the
[1018.20 - 1023.36] food department
[1019.60 - 1026.56] that you consume to stay healthy yeah so
[1023.36 - 1029.44] I always say that uh Indian society when
[1026.56 - 1032.96] a mother puts food on the table she
[1029.44 - 1037.12] doesn't think nutrition she thinks taste
[1032.96 - 1039.88] mhm and I say that if you every time you
[1037.12 - 1042.20] go for a meal if you say is my food
[1039.88 - 1045.60] nutritious is my diet balanced half the
[1042.20 - 1048.20] battle is done true true and and if you
[1045.60 - 1050.80] can sort out your breakfast I say so I
[1048.20 - 1052.76] have a protein shake for breakfast mhm
[1050.80 - 1054.96] and that makes my day because I make it
[1052.76 - 1056.88] in soy milk soy milk and way protein
[1054.96 - 1058.64] because till 2:00 I don't feel hungry
[1056.88 - 1061.92] although at 12 I take a break have some
[1058.64 - 1066.00] fruit but it is sustaining and that sets
[1061.92 - 1068.80] my day the tone that yes I have to eat
[1066.00 - 1071.20] healthy you know what you just said we
[1068.80 - 1074.32] eat out of love and culture but we don't
[1071.20 - 1076.36] eat out of science absolutely wonderful
[1074.32 - 1078.40] so that's that's really good so doctor
[1076.36 - 1080.72] going fine on the high protein in the
[1078.40 - 1082.92] morning but a smoothie form having an
[1080.72 - 1084.68] Apple at 12:00 and getting the first
[1082.92 - 1086.80] traditional Indian meal maybe around
[1084.68 - 1088.68] 2:00 in the afternoon I'm presuming by
[1086.80 - 1090.48] then you've done all your surgeries yeah
[1088.68 - 1092.48] the surgery is finished even if surgery
[1090.48 - 1094.40] is not finished I need 10 minutes
[1092.48 - 1096.80] because my meal is small I'll have
[1094.40 - 1100.12] either some brown rice grilled chicken
[1096.80 - 1104.00] and vegetables or I'll have one Roti and
[1100.12 - 1106.28] uh some uh fish and uh veggies or and a
[1104.00 - 1108.88] salad so it'll be a very small thing one
[1106.28 - 1111.00] plate I never take a refill that is my
[1108.88 - 1113.24] rule doctor I want to ask this question
[1111.00 - 1116.20] if you have a very long surgery do you
[1113.24 - 1118.80] come out you fed your food in 5 or 8
[1116.20 - 1121.32] minutes and you go back into the surgery
[1118.80 - 1124.96] yeah because we are many people we work
[1121.32 - 1127.48] as a team so if it is taking long I'll
[1124.96 - 1130.44] take a break 10 minutes go to the L have
[1127.48 - 1133.32] water eat something maybe have a cup of
[1130.44 - 1136.12] coffee and then come back so so this is
[1133.32 - 1138.04] this is a guidance to all the corporate
[1136.12 - 1141.52] people out there who are not saving
[1138.04 - 1144.12] lives and use this excuse that
[1141.52 - 1146.56] meeting I have to get my 1 hour lunch
[1144.12 - 1148.88] break so I'll skip my food I'll change
[1146.56 - 1151.04] the timing I'll go to the next door daa
[1148.88 - 1153.76] and eat all the wrong food whereas here
[1151.04 - 1156.04] is a surgeon who says I still continue
[1153.76 - 1158.00] my work but I'm eating healthy at the
[1156.04 - 1159.88] same time and I just need that 8 to 10
[1158.00 - 1163.00] minutes to do that eating and go back to
[1159.88 - 1164.68] my job you know my my staff in the
[1163.00 - 1167.92] department they all know that I will eat
[1164.68 - 1169.24] at 2 and they'll tell me Dr Kip 2:00
[1167.92 - 1171.68] time for you to eat
[1169.24 - 1173.24] so that is so good you know even if you
[1171.68 - 1175.20] don't remember and the day they don't
[1173.24 - 1177.44] remind me I said boss you are not
[1175.20 - 1179.24] looking after me you're not reminding me
[1177.44 - 1181.04] so it a very good thing you know people
[1179.24 - 1183.08] around you remind you that it's 2:00 and
[1181.04 - 1186.76] time for you to eat and I tell one thing
[1183.08 - 1189.68] more to people never bring a whole lunch
[1186.76 - 1192.00] in one box get your food in small
[1189.68 - 1193.84] components you get five minutes have
[1192.00 - 1195.88] salad you get five minutes have one
[1193.84 - 1198.28] rooty and subzi you get five minutes
[1195.88 - 1199.16] have fruit you get five minutes you take
[1198.28 - 1202.48] some
[1199.16 - 1204.40] uh you know uh bji egg bori or something
[1202.48 - 1206.04] so unless you want to take the whole
[1204.40 - 1208.20] meal together you need half an hour
[1206.04 - 1210.28] which you'll never get but two minutes
[1208.20 - 1212.76] and you can finish a portion and go back
[1210.28 - 1215.04] so speaking of portions um you know I've
[1212.76 - 1217.44] been working with a lot with longivity
[1215.04 - 1219.80] and fasting and small portion
[1217.44 - 1222.36] sizes because I was so impressed with
[1219.80 - 1224.00] your muscular frame and skeletal frame
[1222.36 - 1227.64] as a 60 plus
[1224.00 - 1230.20] doctor what's your take on the muscular
[1227.64 - 1234.20] part and longevity or muscles and
[1230.20 - 1236.36] Longevity yeah so U longevity is related
[1234.20 - 1240.04] to lean body mass which is basically our
[1236.36 - 1243.24] muscle mass and uh there are studies
[1240.04 - 1246.68] which say that after the age of 60 and
[1243.24 - 1249.88] even more so after 70 we lose about 800
[1246.68 - 1252.40] to 900 gram of muscle mass every year
[1249.88 - 1255.40] and that affects our quality of life in
[1252.40 - 1257.56] Walking In climbing stairs in running
[1255.40 - 1260.40] and if you take at least 60 gam of
[1257.56 - 1262.72] protein a day it stops this muscle mass
[1260.40 - 1265.20] loss and improves quality of life so
[1262.72 - 1267.44] that is one thing if you want your older
[1265.20 - 1269.40] period in life and now in Indians even
[1267.44 - 1271.88] younger period because muscle mass is
[1269.40 - 1274.08] very poor it will improve quality of
[1271.88 - 1276.64] life and it is directly related to
[1274.08 - 1278.44] longevity awesome so you're telling the
[1276.64 - 1280.52] youngsters muscle train you're telling
[1278.44 - 1283.72] the old people muscle train you're
[1280.52 - 1287.52] losing muscle add 60 grams of protein in
[1283.72 - 1290.44] the day doctor your five favorite muscle
[1287.52 - 1293.04] exercises so like I said my warm-up is
[1290.44 - 1296.28] always push-up two sets of yeah two sets
[1293.04 - 1299.24] of 12 push-ups and two sets of squats
[1296.28 - 1303.48] even now with my replac knees I do that
[1299.24 - 1307.16] and uh then I go on to uh at least uh
[1303.48 - 1309.04] one body part three exercises so I try
[1307.16 - 1310.88] either Chase so if I'm in a hurry I will
[1309.04 - 1313.56] do my big muscles which are the big
[1310.88 - 1316.60] muscles so big muscles is back big
[1313.56 - 1319.08] muscles is chest big muscles thighs so
[1316.60 - 1320.72] I'll say okay I'll do my thighs and go
[1319.08 - 1322.92] because today I have less time I'll do
[1320.72 - 1325.48] this or I'll do my back or I'll do my
[1322.92 - 1328.04] chest the smaller muscles if you have
[1325.48 - 1330.40] time you can do that but in a hurry uh
[1328.04 - 1333.40] do your big muscle uh it metabolizes
[1330.40 - 1335.00] more calories it increase your BMR more
[1333.40 - 1338.12] what is your shortest workout you have
[1335.00 - 1341.40] ever done because you were in Aur today
[1338.12 - 1343.40] tell today no I had to go I had to go uh
[1341.40 - 1345.92] um help a colleague's mother I had to do
[1343.40 - 1349.20] a dressing before I came here okay so I
[1345.92 - 1351.64] told my trainer that look I went in
[1349.20 - 1354.56] I I did my warmup I did 10 minutes of
[1351.64 - 1357.32] cardio I did push-ups I did squats and I
[1354.56 - 1359.00] said today that is enough see there are
[1357.32 - 1361.64] three exercises which you can do and
[1359.00 - 1363.52] exercise your whole body push-ups squats
[1361.64 - 1365.56] and pull-ups if you can do these three
[1363.52 - 1367.76] exercises all your body muscles are
[1365.56 - 1370.28] excise so quickest is two two sets of
[1367.76 - 1372.16] each after your warm up and then my
[1370.28 - 1374.44] trainer did five minutes of stretching
[1372.16 - 1377.36] for me stretching is important you
[1374.44 - 1379.28] cannot get in exercise get out you know
[1377.36 - 1381.48] one cardiolog this friend of minded uh
[1379.28 - 1383.12] he found out that his cholesterol is
[1381.48 - 1385.00] higher his weight is increasing bought a
[1383.12 - 1387.96] treadmill he would jump onto the
[1385.00 - 1389.96] treadmill 30 minutes and then run off he
[1387.96 - 1392.16] developed such severe fibromyalgia in
[1389.96 - 1394.12] his back his entire back was stiff it
[1392.16 - 1396.40] took us six months to get him all right
[1394.12 - 1397.64] I said you can't mess with exercise so
[1396.40 - 1399.28] what you're saying is people who
[1397.64 - 1401.32] suddenly decide to oh I'm going to get
[1399.28 - 1404.68] fit I'm going to start running suddenly
[1401.32 - 1407.20] stretch first warm up properly start
[1404.68 - 1408.92] slow and steady because I think a lot of
[1407.20 - 1411.68] people are getting motivated by these
[1408.92 - 1412.88] Instagram videos your podcast my podcast
[1411.68 - 1415.16] and they suddenly think they're James
[1412.88 - 1417.36] Bond so I say your mind is stronger than
[1415.16 - 1418.72] your body you think you can do it but
[1417.36 - 1421.60] you actually
[1418.72 - 1424.36] cannot so so what are the tips listen to
[1421.60 - 1425.92] your body should I check my heart rate
[1424.36 - 1427.52] like for example a lot of people say no
[1425.92 - 1429.44] no I don't have time but I'm going to
[1427.52 - 1430.80] run so I'm going to run for 10 minutes
[1429.44 - 1433.04] but I don't have time to do 10 minutes
[1430.80 - 1434.76] of stretch up so when somebody's fat
[1433.04 - 1436.96] somebody's Plum somebody's a medical
[1434.76 - 1438.64] profession somebody's in a techie you
[1436.96 - 1440.60] know everybody says they're so busy busy
[1438.64 - 1442.56] in today's world and and the person came
[1440.60 - 1444.60] in front of you what is the exercise
[1442.56 - 1446.28] regime that you would tell them to do I
[1444.60 - 1447.76] tell them that I want you to do 30
[1446.28 - 1449.84] minutes of brisk walking every day
[1447.76 - 1451.80] that's all and in that I tell them how
[1449.84 - 1454.52] to go about it I said if you're in a
[1451.80 - 1456.28] park first round relaxed you will do it
[1454.52 - 1458.48] in a park you will wear good shoes you
[1456.28 - 1461.00] will walk on kacha soil not on a hard
[1458.48 - 1463.28] track you will do bris so first round is
[1461.00 - 1465.80] relaxed that is warmup then you increase
[1463.28 - 1467.28] your speed and at till the speed where
[1465.80 - 1470.04] you're starting to get breathless then
[1467.28 - 1472.36] slow down a little that's Rhythm do 5
[1470.04 - 1474.44] minutes at fast pace and then one round
[1472.36 - 1476.92] to relax so start with 5 minutes of
[1474.44 - 1479.04] brisk walking after a week 10 minutes
[1476.92 - 1480.84] after a week 15 minutes so you have to
[1479.04 - 1482.92] reach 30 minutes of brisk walk I don't
[1480.84 - 1484.64] want you to go go to the gym your body
[1482.92 - 1487.40] will tell you your nutrition will tell
[1484.64 - 1489.60] you now I'm ready to exercise in the gym
[1487.40 - 1492.60] awesome advice doctor for everyone to
[1489.60 - 1494.68] follow in India start slow and steady in
[1492.60 - 1496.84] 2024 when you start making a resolution
[1494.68 - 1499.12] this is the way to start now doctor you
[1496.84 - 1501.32] are a surgeon you're an aesthetic
[1499.12 - 1503.72] surgeon plastic surgeon you change
[1501.32 - 1505.00] people from outside but you're also very
[1503.72 - 1507.88] passionate about diet you're very
[1505.00 - 1510.92] passionate about exercise does nutrition
[1507.88 - 1514.68] affect our gut health and our digestion
[1510.92 - 1516.64] yes absolutely um uh the uh so I tell
[1514.68 - 1519.80] them it has to be a balanced right you
[1516.64 - 1521.76] have to have fiber you have to have
[1519.80 - 1524.72] green vegetables you know colored
[1521.76 - 1526.92] vegetables are the key to your vitamin
[1524.72 - 1529.68] health and then one more thing it is
[1526.92 - 1532.68] there that uh I always always uh take
[1529.68 - 1535.28] glutamine in my workout drink glutamine
[1532.68 - 1538.36] my favorite amino acid yes it is the it
[1535.28 - 1541.96] is the exclusive food for our gut cells
[1538.36 - 1544.08] ocytes ocytes do not consume anything
[1541.96 - 1546.44] else other than glutamine so glutamine
[1544.08 - 1549.04] is an excellent thing for gut health uh
[1546.44 - 1552.48] lot of cancer uh medical oncologists use
[1549.04 - 1555.68] it for their patients it also enhances
[1552.48 - 1557.76] good recovery of the muscle so glutamine
[1555.68 - 1560.72] supplementation enough fiber in your
[1557.76 - 1563.00] diet in enough water see you need water
[1560.72 - 1565.00] and fiber both to get the gut rolling so
[1563.00 - 1566.40] that you move the bowel and what people
[1565.00 - 1567.76] don't do is they don't drink enough
[1566.40 - 1570.60] water so I think a little bit of
[1567.76 - 1572.36] exercise to have gravity shake you up uh
[1570.60 - 1575.16] a little bit of water a little bit of
[1572.36 - 1577.48] glutamine little bit of fiber uh but
[1575.16 - 1580.36] doctor you know I as a nutritionist I've
[1577.48 - 1583.68] been uh telling people in the older days
[1580.36 - 1585.40] we ate out once a quarter because Daddy
[1583.68 - 1588.36] got some money and we could go to this
[1585.40 - 1590.92] Posh Restaurant and then maybe about 10
[1588.36 - 1592.88] years ago we ate out once a month about
[1590.92 - 1594.72] 5 years ago everyone's eating out once a
[1592.88 - 1597.12] week now everyone's using the click of a
[1594.72 - 1598.28] button and ordering all of these online
[1597.12 - 1601.00] Foods I'm sure you see it with the
[1598.28 - 1603.20] younger doctors in your hospital yes so
[1601.00 - 1605.56] are you a doctor that promotes a tiffen
[1603.20 - 1605.56] box
[1607.12 - 1611.08] carrying order out from these apps from
[1609.52 - 1613.48] a digestive point of view what's your
[1611.08 - 1615.28] take so I believe that if you carry your
[1613.48 - 1616.80] food you will eat it if you're not
[1615.28 - 1618.52] carrying food you will eat whatever is
[1616.80 - 1620.92] available and that that may not be
[1618.52 - 1623.28] healthy so so that is the uh most
[1620.92 - 1625.44] important thing about food what happens
[1623.28 - 1627.76] Ryan is that once you start building
[1625.44 - 1629.52] muscle bulk you feel the need to have
[1627.76 - 1631.48] enough protein in your food and if you
[1629.52 - 1633.08] don't get it you get upset we go to
[1631.48 - 1634.56] parties and there are two three of us
[1633.08 - 1636.36] like-minded people we are hunting for
[1634.56 - 1638.16] protein so you have to have enough
[1636.36 - 1640.08] protein you have to have some
[1638.16 - 1643.88] carbohydrates you have to have enough
[1640.08 - 1645.72] greens and salads and you're done so if
[1643.88 - 1647.36] even if you sometimes have to order
[1645.72 - 1649.24] order something which contains all of
[1647.36 - 1652.16] these rather than saying no I'll order
[1649.24 - 1654.24] some maybe chart or a burger or
[1652.16 - 1656.24] something order a sandwich order a
[1654.24 - 1658.96] multigrain sandwich you'll have fish in
[1656.24 - 1661.44] that uh with salad and is good and uh
[1658.96 - 1662.88] you can order healthy food but it should
[1661.44 - 1665.04] be in your mind that I want to eat
[1662.88 - 1667.12] healthy is it true doctor because I read
[1665.04 - 1670.28] one study that says when people are the
[1667.12 - 1671.88] most stressed out or most short of time
[1670.28 - 1673.60] they're very hangry and they make the
[1671.88 - 1675.88] worst decisions to order the most
[1673.60 - 1678.56] unhealthy food at that moment yeah these
[1675.88 - 1682.96] are people who are not loving their
[1678.56 - 1686.36] bodies see I said I push my body every
[1682.96 - 1688.92] day to the extreme why would I now eat
[1686.36 - 1691.64] unhealthy I mean why am I doing all this
[1688.92 - 1695.00] if I'm not going to feed it so I feed my
[1691.64 - 1698.40] body I feed my muscles I feed my health
[1695.00 - 1700.48] so if Dr kulp was a vehicle or a car
[1698.40 - 1703.00] he'd be a Rolls-Royce and he would be
[1700.48 - 1706.40] telling everyone my body is the most
[1703.00 - 1708.68] expensive real estate I own I live in it
[1706.40 - 1711.84] as a landlord I don't live in it as a
[1708.68 - 1714.68] tenant would you say that's true Dr K AB
[1711.84 - 1717.36] absolutely I own it you own it and now
[1714.68 - 1718.80] speaking of internal beauty and stuff
[1717.36 - 1720.64] like that we talked about nutrition
[1718.80 - 1724.60] exercise now you're a doctor which who
[1720.64 - 1728.96] makes people beautiful also from a skin
[1724.60 - 1731.80] perspective uh nutrition and exercise
[1728.96 - 1734.36] how will it help from prevention acne
[1731.80 - 1736.52] point of you wrinkles growing older or
[1734.36 - 1739.12] how do I get more clear and radiant skin
[1736.52 - 1741.56] I remember when I met you in Mumbai for
[1739.12 - 1742.92] the aesthetic conference that I
[1741.56 - 1745.72] automatically assumed you were in your
[1742.92 - 1747.76] 40s your skin was glowing it had that it
[1745.72 - 1750.84] had that glow to it so what's your
[1747.76 - 1754.96] secrets to adding food in your diet so
[1750.84 - 1757.80] um I think what you have to do is have
[1754.96 - 1760.24] enough vitamins have enough antioxidants
[1757.80 - 1764.12] there is so much of free radicals being
[1760.24 - 1767.44] generated everywhere uh environment by
[1764.12 - 1769.20] the Sun and so many things that if you
[1767.44 - 1772.08] have enough antioxidants you will do
[1769.20 - 1776.24] well so uh like I was talking I I
[1772.08 - 1778.60] consume uh one gr one gram of that amla
[1776.24 - 1781.00] extract vitamin C every day so for
[1778.60 - 1782.96] dinner when I sit down in my water I add
[1781.00 - 1785.36] one and I have that with my food so I'm
[1782.96 - 1787.88] doing that vitamin C is a brilliant
[1785.36 - 1790.72] antioxidant it is also a very strong
[1787.88 - 1792.44] immune booster it is a depigment it is
[1790.72 - 1794.72] something which is you know helps in
[1792.44 - 1796.40] almost every part of your body and that
[1794.72 - 1798.04] is one thing which has been with me and
[1796.40 - 1799.88] I always make sure there are enough col
[1798.04 - 1802.04] colored vegetables in my food and that
[1799.88 - 1804.36] helps your skin I tell my patients nail
[1802.04 - 1806.16] is pure protein you need protein for the
[1804.36 - 1807.96] hair you need protein for the blood you
[1806.16 - 1810.28] need protein for the bone you need
[1807.96 - 1814.08] protein for muscle for everything
[1810.28 - 1817.52] hemoglobin is half globin and half H
[1814.08 - 1820.16] iron and protein so you have to make
[1817.52 - 1822.24] sure now since covid people have become
[1820.16 - 1824.24] more sensitive I do their nutritional
[1822.24 - 1826.12] profile when they come to me if there is
[1824.24 - 1828.28] hairfall if they have bad skin if they
[1826.12 - 1829.92] have acne I said you you have to at
[1828.28 - 1831.68] least know that your nutrition is
[1829.92 - 1833.84] adequate and they're surprised sometimes
[1831.68 - 1835.68] they fall see everything ha wire and
[1833.84 - 1838.72] then we sort that out slowly and they
[1835.68 - 1841.72] get into a better regimen of diet skin
[1838.72 - 1843.76] care nutrition exercise Dr Kip is
[1841.72 - 1847.20] wonderful talking to you today you know
[1843.76 - 1849.32] as a medical doctor surgeon expert any
[1847.20 - 1851.48] fascinating study that you have come
[1849.32 - 1853.76] across that will motivate millions of
[1851.48 - 1855.76] Indians which when you get your private
[1853.76 - 1857.28] clients coming to you and you're telling
[1855.76 - 1859.12] them correct your exercise correct your
[1857.28 - 1861.24] dat is there any fascinating study that
[1859.12 - 1863.92] you would like to share with our
[1861.24 - 1865.64] listeners yes so so there was a study
[1863.92 - 1868.12] published in the American Journal of
[1865.64 - 1870.84] nutrition and this was a systematic
[1868.12 - 1873.84] review of 50 studies and they had
[1870.84 - 1875.84] compared a high carb low protein diet to
[1873.84 - 1878.64] a low carb high protein diet and there
[1875.84 - 1881.36] were three distinct advantages which all
[1878.64 - 1883.12] studies agreed on one is eating more
[1881.36 - 1885.16] protein is thermogenic you need more
[1883.12 - 1886.72] calories to burn protein so if you just
[1885.16 - 1888.92] change your diet don't change your
[1886.72 - 1893.32] lifestyle at all you will will probably
[1888.92 - 1895.68] burn uh lose about 1.5 kgs per year just
[1893.32 - 1898.00] by changing your food second is it
[1895.68 - 1900.40] provide Sati third is it promotes
[1898.00 - 1902.72] selective fat loss so these were three
[1900.40 - 1903.88] conclusions of the systematic review uh
[1902.72 - 1905.96] published in the American General
[1903.88 - 1908.96] Nutrition and that has stuck with me it
[1905.96 - 1910.68] is such good satiety carbs the more you
[1908.96 - 1914.04] carbs you eat the more carbs you want to
[1910.68 - 1916.12] eat again because hunger is sustained
[1914.04 - 1918.80] rather than satiated so would you also
[1916.12 - 1922.04] say that fasting is part of your G not
[1918.80 - 1924.16] fasting I I I don't really fast if I
[1922.04 - 1926.04] think I have eaten enough in the evening
[1924.16 - 1928.04] sometimes evening I come and snack then
[1926.04 - 1930.60] I skip my dinner and I just have a
[1928.04 - 1932.64] protein shake uh and go to sleep awesome
[1930.60 - 1934.60] and uh yeah that is good because then I
[1932.64 - 1936.04] balance out everything one thing I want
[1934.60 - 1938.04] to tell you we have a doctor's lounge
[1936.04 - 1939.92] and every day or every alternate day
[1938.04 - 1942.64] some of the other consultant is giving
[1939.92 - 1945.16] lunches you know daughter is got married
[1942.64 - 1947.92] we have a grandchild so what did I do I
[1945.16 - 1950.84] got 250 bottles of milk protein shakes
[1947.92 - 1953.92] so I said this is lactose free this is
[1950.84 - 1955.64] no sugar and you will drink this and uh
[1953.92 - 1957.36] this will you know you will at least get
[1955.64 - 1959.60] a taste of what a protein Che you have
[1957.36 - 1961.96] very bad impressions of how protein
[1959.60 - 1964.08] tastes so doctor you know we talk about
[1961.96 - 1966.56] the skin and we talk about health and we
[1964.08 - 1968.20] talk about exercising and workout and
[1966.56 - 1969.76] you start breathing heavily and all now
[1968.20 - 1972.76] speaking of
[1969.76 - 1972.76] breathing
[1973.28 - 1978.32] situation it's really polluted uh
[1976.16 - 1981.28] schools are closing down and we're
[1978.32 - 1983.92] hearing doctors talking about the risk
[1981.28 - 1986.24] elements to health to the skin to the
[1983.92 - 1990.24] immunity system to the liver to the
[1986.24 - 1993.52] lungs what is it that a person can do to
[1990.24 - 1997.08] biohack their body so um when I first
[1993.52 - 2000.04] started cycling uh even in times when
[1997.08 - 2003.32] the uh pollution is less I've always
[2000.04 - 2005.56] used an n95 mask sorry even before Co
[2003.32 - 2008.60] used to use it yeah for the last 15
[2005.56 - 2010.36] years so that means people who work out
[2008.60 - 2012.20] in cities they're taking in all of this
[2010.36 - 2013.48] smoke and pollution and they think
[2012.20 - 2015.96] they're getting fitter but they're also
[2013.48 - 2017.64] putting in a lot of smoke yeah but what
[2015.96 - 2020.24] convince what convinced you to use an
[2017.64 - 2023.24] n95 mask before what was the thought
[2020.24 - 2025.84] process as a doctor n95 masks are
[2023.24 - 2027.32] primarily anti-pollution masks we have
[2025.84 - 2029.92] used them for covid
[2027.32 - 2031.32] later ah so so they are anti-pollution
[2029.92 - 2033.96] masks it is written there it is an
[2031.32 - 2036.04] anti-pollution mask and uh what I
[2033.96 - 2038.96] happened was when I in the evening when
[2036.04 - 2041.68] I come back I blow my nose I could see
[2038.96 - 2044.32] uh dust I mean uh the what secretions
[2041.68 - 2046.72] come they are uh contaminated with dirt
[2044.32 - 2049.16] you'll be surprised I used to go cycling
[2046.72 - 2051.52] and I wear white masks so the outside
[2049.16 - 2053.24] would be turned dark blackish and the
[2051.52 - 2054.80] inside would be absolutely white and
[2053.24 - 2057.32] when I blew my nose after coming back
[2054.80 - 2059.32] from cycling it was absolutely clean so
[2057.32 - 2061.36] that encouraged me and it was like a
[2059.32 - 2063.76] sort of hypoxic training because there's
[2061.36 - 2067.28] a part on Nelson Mandela Road where it
[2063.76 - 2069.40] is uphill and for 3 kilomet so that was
[2067.28 - 2071.96] a good exercise and I used to keep my
[2069.40 - 2073.32] mask on so in Co actually it conditioned
[2071.96 - 2074.88] me I didn't have any problem wearing a
[2073.32 - 2077.40] mask all the time you know James Nest
[2074.88 - 2078.72] has written a latest book called breath
[2077.40 - 2080.96] uh and he's a journalist that
[2078.72 - 2083.88] interviewed pulmon
[2080.96 - 2086.48] pulmonologists across the world and the
[2083.88 - 2090.08] latest information from deep sea divers
[2086.48 - 2093.48] to highend athletes is that the same
[2090.08 - 2095.12] intensity of breathing uh is better when
[2093.48 - 2096.40] you breathe only in through your nose
[2095.12 - 2100.08] and out through your nose and what you
[2096.40 - 2102.08] mentioned more carbon dioxide allows for
[2100.08 - 2104.60] lesser hyperventilation and lesser
[2102.08 - 2106.56] effort to an exercise but you know
[2104.60 - 2108.68] people in Delhi are smoking 25 30
[2106.56 - 2111.52] cigarettes a day as per a Times of India
[2108.68 - 2114.20] article yeah so we don't see the
[2111.52 - 2116.76] pollution is your advice to people to
[2114.20 - 2119.04] try and wear a mask during the season of
[2116.76 - 2122.68] high pollution yeah so what what I did
[2119.04 - 2128.28] Ryan was I bought a sensor uh which uh
[2122.68 - 2131.68] senses uh BM 2.5 okay and uh I took it
[2128.28 - 2134.60] to my workplace in my room in the lobby
[2131.68 - 2138.16] in my car in my study in my drawing room
[2134.60 - 2140.84] and outside okay and then I could place
[2138.16 - 2143.76] which place is clean and which place I
[2140.84 - 2145.76] need to wear a mask so my hospital is
[2143.76 - 2148.72] clean the theaters actually have the
[2145.76 - 2150.84] lowest PM 2.5 is like 910 because they
[2148.72 - 2153.12] have hea filters all over uh my rooms
[2150.84 - 2155.64] are also clean uh air conditioning also
[2153.12 - 2157.72] to a certain extent brings down uh the
[2155.64 - 2159.52] pollution level especially uh Central
[2157.72 - 2161.92] air conditioning which is not getting in
[2159.52 - 2163.76] direct air from the outside the big cars
[2161.92 - 2167.00] all have hipa filters and I could have
[2163.76 - 2169.52] 40 inside my car and 400 outside the PM
[2167.00 - 2171.52] 2.5 the smaller cars don't have HEPA
[2169.52 - 2174.28] filters so my daughter's car we put a
[2171.52 - 2176.56] Philips car small portable portable
[2174.28 - 2180.88] filter into the car in 5 minutes it
[2176.56 - 2183.08] makes the PM 2.5 go to 40 wow wow so
[2180.88 - 2185.04] everywhere once I know where pollution
[2183.08 - 2187.04] is more and where it is less then I say
[2185.04 - 2189.92] only when I'm outdoors I will wear a
[2187.04 - 2193.68] mask very intellectual and very fantle
[2189.92 - 2197.04] question uh or utopian question if you
[2193.68 - 2198.80] were the health minister of India what
[2197.04 - 2202.08] would you change for this pollution
[2198.80 - 2203.96] thing so I tweeted one day to to the
[2202.08 - 2206.36] environment Ministry to the chief
[2203.96 - 2208.00] minister of Delhi I said the best thing
[2206.36 - 2210.20] we have seen for pollution is if you
[2208.00 - 2212.04] have weekly rain you know it was raining
[2210.20 - 2214.24] for some time this year we had the
[2212.04 - 2216.04] longest low pollution period this time
[2214.24 - 2217.60] in this year before this pollution
[2216.04 - 2219.44] started again and that was because
[2217.60 - 2221.56] almost every week we would have rainfall
[2219.44 - 2223.40] it washes everything down aqi is down
[2221.56 - 2225.76] and we are good so the I said the best
[2223.40 - 2227.60] thing is seed clouds have rain every
[2225.76 - 2229.80] week for these two months and you're
[2227.60 - 2231.28] done so I think that is the easiest
[2229.80 - 2233.56] they've been only cribbing they've not
[2231.28 - 2236.88] been doing anything the measures are all
[2233.56 - 2239.12] half measures so we should end on a less
[2236.88 - 2241.36] chokey note and a more happy note what
[2239.12 - 2243.76] about sleep doctor how many hours do you
[2241.36 - 2247.64] sleep what do you recommend to your
[2243.76 - 2250.00] patients your clients and uh uh e is
[2247.64 - 2252.92] there anything in the Sleep Department
[2250.00 - 2254.60] that you take from improving your sleep
[2252.92 - 2257.80] is there any biohacking or any nutrition
[2254.60 - 2261.24] that you do so um workout drinks mostly
[2257.80 - 2264.56] contain caffeine yes so if you are doing
[2261.24 - 2267.52] evening exercise take yeah you have to
[2264.56 - 2269.08] be careful or you get uh low caffeine
[2267.52 - 2271.20] medium caffeine high caffeine
[2269.08 - 2273.64] pre-workout drinks or make it half a
[2271.20 - 2276.12] scoop or drink only little or remove it
[2273.64 - 2278.68] entirely from your but you have to be
[2276.12 - 2281.60] careful or like me if you sleep like at
[2278.68 - 2283.36] midnight see I my my mental faculty is
[2281.60 - 2285.12] more active at night if I have to do
[2283.36 - 2288.04] written work I do that but I sleep
[2285.12 - 2290.80] definitely by 12:00 and I get up at 6:45
[2288.04 - 2293.12] or 7 so 7 hours of sleep I get every day
[2290.80 - 2295.64] and surprisingly from the time I started
[2293.12 - 2298.48] working out I can sleep like this your
[2295.64 - 2300.52] body demands sleep s so exercise is the
[2298.48 - 2302.72] best sedative work out and you sleep
[2300.52 - 2307.56] like a baby so so doctor we'll end this
[2302.72 - 2311.32] episode with if senior Dr kulp had to
[2307.56 - 2313.60] travel back in time and meet Junior kulp
[2311.32 - 2315.20] what would you tell him differently so
[2313.60 - 2317.72] uh yeah I will tell you about this one
[2315.20 - 2319.96] of my colleagues son he was going to
[2317.72 - 2321.96] engineering college and he was quite
[2319.96 - 2323.96] thin and he said Uncle I want to build
[2321.96 - 2326.20] some muscle so I said okay you're going
[2323.96 - 2328.32] to boarding I mean it is hostel what can
[2326.20 - 2330.24] you eat what protein can you get can you
[2328.32 - 2332.28] get eggs he said yeah I can get eggs I
[2330.24 - 2333.96] said okay so One Source done second you
[2332.28 - 2336.44] can take we protein with you and
[2333.96 - 2338.64] otherwise everything else is a bonus
[2336.44 - 2340.88] every day you will eat four egg whites
[2338.64 - 2342.76] one whole egg three whites and one scoop
[2340.88 - 2344.60] of a protein anytime you get you drink
[2342.76 - 2346.72] milk you can drink with that so we gave
[2344.60 - 2348.44] him resource and he's a lazy person he
[2346.72 - 2351.08] would go to the gym only 3 days a week
[2348.44 - 2353.28] and he would do only eight reps per set
[2351.08 - 2355.76] and when he came back after 5 years
[2353.28 - 2357.16] because this 18 to 20 period now you
[2355.76 - 2358.80] know what do you need three things to
[2357.16 - 2361.00] build muscle which I didn't know then
[2358.80 - 2363.32] you need nutrition you need exercise and
[2361.00 - 2365.84] you need testosterone and an 18-year-old
[2363.32 - 2368.76] has an abundance of testosterone it is
[2365.84 - 2370.60] so easy to build muscle I didn't know it
[2368.76 - 2373.64] then nor did we have resources now if I
[2370.60 - 2374.72] would go I would be like a hunk in
[2373.64 - 2377.56] medical
[2374.72 - 2379.84] school you are you are a hunk in a lot
