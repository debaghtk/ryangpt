Or What is it that is holding you back? One area where our genetic make-up has an impact on us is our capacity for athletic performance. The manner we workout, what we eat, and other factors all greatly impact how we develop our potential. The nature of the potential could be determined by genes. Even if you have the genetic potential to be a great athlete, you are unlikely to fulfill that potential if you adopt a lifestyle of binge eating and inactivity. However, a person with a limited genetic potential might still discover methods to make up for it and do well. You are gifted with the genes that you have got. You can't change them, but you can work on them. Aligning your nutrition with your genes will allow you to get maximum performance and achieve your full potential.
