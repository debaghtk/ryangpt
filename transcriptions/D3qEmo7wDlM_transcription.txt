[0.03 - 5.25] hi I'm chef Nicola national rifle
[3.24 - 7.29] shooter and I have been working with one
[5.25 - 9.72] nutritionist specifically with Ryan and
[7.29 - 11.31] Abigail for the last year so during the
[9.72 - 14.03] course of the last year I have seen my
[11.31 - 16.86] performance improve and I have also
[14.03 - 19.89] learned a few things along the way so
[16.86 - 22.20] one of them is that I have now I'm very
[19.89 - 25.53] clear about what I should and shouldn't
[22.20 - 29.31] be eating as a shooter I've also learned
[25.53 - 32.58] the benefits of a few foods and the role
[29.31 - 34.47] they play in my overall nutrition a
[32.58 - 38.12] thing that I really liked was that Ryan
[34.47 - 41.57] and Abigail didn't only focus on the
[38.12 - 44.76] nutrition part of it but also focused on
[41.57 - 48.78] other aspects of what I would need to do
[44.76 - 51.96] to be a better shooter such as exercises
[48.78 - 54.54] for keeping the heart rate low and the
[51.96 - 58.20] breathing slow and steady
[54.54 - 60.35] I've also understood the value of good
[58.20 - 62.16] nutrition in a sports person's life so
[60.35 - 65.85] yeah these were the few of the things
[62.16 - 67.98] that I've learned over the last year and
[65.85 - 71.37] I will definitely be implementing and
[67.98 - 73.97] keeping them in mind in the future and
[71.37 - 76.64] also like to thank Ryan and Abigail for
[73.97 - 80.15] guiding me throughout this last year so
[76.64 - 80.15] yes thank you
