[0.16 - 6.64] part two the other ala in minerals is
[3.52 - 9.04] magnesium and zinc best had at the
[6.64 - 10.88] nighttime for zinc I always advise on an
[9.04 - 12.96] empty stomach but many people including
[10.88 - 15.44] me get a little bit of acidity so I
[12.96 - 18.04] combine it in my post dinner meal now
[15.44 - 19.92] magnesium comes in various forms best
[18.04 - 23.28] had at night time to give you a deeper
[19.92 - 27.08] sleep and better softer stool for gutal
[23.28 - 29.28] probiotics best had before a meal or at
[27.08 - 31.40] least an hour after a meal because when
[29.28 - 34.56] you take it with the the acid tends to
[31.40 - 36.88] break down and destroy the good bacteria
[34.56 - 39.48] so if you want a healthy gut take your
[36.88 - 42.16] probiotic just before bedtime or first
[39.48 - 44.56] thing on waking up last but most
[42.16 - 47.04] important 60% of your brain is made of
[44.56 - 49.08] fat Omega-3s are so responsible for all
[47.04 - 51.72] your blood vessels omega-3 is in my
[49.08 - 54.16] opinion are best had with fats in your
[51.72 - 56.20] diet so I always pair my omega-3 with a
[54.16 - 57.72] meal the best time to take it is in the
[56.20 - 59.60] night time so it can help in cellular
[57.72 - 61.92] repair but for children take it early
[59.60 - 61.92] morning
