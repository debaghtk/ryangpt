[2.56 - 8.88] 2020 and 2021 we saw a lot of people
[6.32 - 10.24] corporate ceos running on treadmills and
[8.88 - 12.48] collapsing of heart attacks and i
[10.24 - 14.00] thought who better than to invite dr
[12.48 - 16.32] ashish who's the
[14.00 - 18.08] race medical director in the mumbai
[16.32 - 20.08] marathon so if any
[18.08 - 22.00] any marathon happens and we are running
[20.08 - 24.08] over there dr ashish is the guy that's
[22.00 - 25.20] saving our life uh hopefully you don't
[24.08 - 27.44] get a heart attack when you run so
[25.20 - 28.40] ashish my first question to you doc is
[27.44 - 31.52] that
[28.40 - 33.84] is it okay to exercise in 2022
[31.52 - 37.28] thanks ryan you know it's it's actually
[33.84 - 39.36] quite quite sad and quite ironic that
[37.28 - 41.60] over the last year because we've had
[39.36 - 45.04] these unfortunate events
[41.60 - 48.16] we are being asked the reverse question
[45.04 - 50.72] normally people should ask or is it bad
[48.16 - 53.68] not to exercise how can i or my loved
[50.72 - 55.76] one exercise and today over the last
[53.68 - 59.04] year year and a half people are asking
[55.76 - 60.80] the question in reverse um so give me a
[59.04 - 62.72] couple of minutes to talk on this
[60.80 - 64.88] subject because it's something which you
[62.72 - 67.04] know you can't have a one-liner on and
[64.88 - 68.96] ironically since the last four five
[67.04 - 71.52] months i've done probably
[68.96 - 74.24] ten different podcasts and events such
[71.52 - 76.32] as this around this subject and yours
[74.24 - 77.68] let me distill it down for you
[76.32 - 80.64] exercise
[77.68 - 83.60] is absolutely fabulous if we could put
[80.64 - 85.92] all the benefits of exercise into a pill
[83.60 - 87.84] it would probably be the best selling
[85.92 - 89.92] pill ever okay
[87.84 - 91.12] apart from your heart
[89.92 - 94.00] stroke
[91.12 - 96.88] cancer pretty much every chronic disease
[94.00 - 99.60] known to man exercise reduces your risk
[96.88 - 102.32] of getting it and in god forbid you have
[99.60 - 104.00] got it exercise improves your quality of
[102.32 - 106.24] life and reduces your chance of it
[104.00 - 107.84] becoming worse that's enough in a
[106.24 - 109.44] nutshell okay
[107.84 - 112.96] having said that
[109.44 - 114.80] exercise does not provide immunity
[112.96 - 117.12] against heart attack and death and this
[114.80 - 120.80] is where people make a mistake
[117.12 - 124.00] just because someone is exercising does
[120.80 - 126.32] not mean they cannot have an event since
[124.00 - 129.04] we are talking about the subject of
[126.32 - 131.20] heart there are different risk factors
[129.04 - 133.36] which contribute towards a person having
[131.20 - 134.96] a heart attack okay the usual ones which
[133.36 - 138.72] i'm sure you've spoken about several
[134.96 - 141.28] times in the past smoking diabetes high
[138.72 - 142.72] blood pressure high cholesterol
[141.28 - 144.24] heavy weight
[142.72 - 146.80] genetics
[144.24 - 148.96] and last is lack of exercise so
[146.80 - 151.68] obviously if you're exercising you're
[148.96 - 153.68] getting rid of one risk factor that
[151.68 - 156.32] doesn't mean that you cannot have now
[153.68 - 158.88] all these people who unfortunately died
[156.32 - 161.36] young i cannot comment on what their
[158.88 - 162.08] risk factors were because i do not know
[161.36 - 164.40] it
[162.08 - 165.52] but i just want to say that just because
[164.40 - 168.40] you're fit
[165.52 - 170.56] does not mean you have immunity you have
[168.40 - 172.72] protection but not immunity and that's
[170.56 - 175.12] what people need to understand one one
[172.72 - 177.92] final point when people
[175.12 - 180.32] who are very well known have an event it
[177.92 - 182.96] also makes disproportionate views in the
[180.32 - 184.72] headline when people are exercising and
[182.96 - 187.20] they have an event it makes
[184.72 - 189.12] disproportional news you rarely read in
[187.20 - 191.04] the newspaper somebody sitting at home
[189.12 - 193.44] watching tv has a heart attack doesn't
[191.04 - 195.28] make the news but if the person was in a
[193.44 - 196.80] gym or outdoor exercising it does make
[195.28 - 200.56] them so
[196.80 - 200.56] exercise is beneficial so don't
