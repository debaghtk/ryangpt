Corporate Employee Nutrition Programs: Healthy employees are more productive. Workplace stress is a prevalent issue that affects absenteeism, employee turnover, workplace performance, and productivity. Employees and employers alike suffer from excessive stress. So, what can be done to make things better? Lack of control, too much work, too much pressure, too much responsibility, lack of management support, company restructuring, disputes with others, and a lack of clarity among nervous employees about what they were expected to be doing were listed as the main causes of workplace stress.You might be shocked to hear that what you eat has a significant impact on your workplace efficiency. Your meal choices have an impact on your energy levels, alertness, and concentration. Many individuals use stimulants to get a boost in the morning, but caffeinated drinks, sugary foods, and cigarettes only provide a brief burst of adrenaline, which then fades as the stimulant wears off, resulting in a yoyo effect that many people continue to experience throughout the day.You need stable blood sugar levels for energy, alertness, and concentration at work to perform at your best. If you eat healthful things like fruit, salad, veggies, nuts, and legumes, you'll be more productive. Wholegrain flour is preferable to refined flour. These nutrients offer sustained energy and glucose to the brain, not just in short bursts, but over time, allowing you to operate at your best throughout the day. #eatinghabits #exercisetoreducefat #ryanfernando
