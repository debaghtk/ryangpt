[0.44 - 3.20] I wonder if he should really shoot this
[2.00 - 5.88] one
[3.20 - 8.44] but it's about hard work and all of
[5.88 - 9.76] those who work really hard and to all
[8.44 - 12.80] the parents out there who are worried
[9.76 - 14.40] about the children who really work hard
[12.80 - 16.52] this video is for all of you because I'm
[14.40 - 20.04] a health coach and I believe your health
[16.52 - 23.32] takes priority over hard work Anna
[20.04 - 25.52] Sebastian perial was a young woman and
[23.32 - 29.04] she literally gave her life for a hard
[25.52 - 31.56] work 26 years of age full of Dreams full
[29.04 - 33.72] of potential excit of the future it's
[31.56 - 35.64] like somebody on my own team at the Quan
[33.72 - 38.04] clinics she's a school topper College
[35.64 - 40.72] topper a distinction holder in the
[38.04 - 43.20] chartered accountancy exams was excited
[40.72 - 46.44] about life just four months after
[43.20 - 48.80] joining a consultancy firm one of the
[46.44 - 52.60] largest accounting firms in the world
[48.80 - 55.12] and her passed away she died due to what
[52.60 - 58.48] her family calls work stress and I
[55.12 - 60.88] believe this exists I do see it as a
[58.48 - 63.96] boss in a company where my youngsters in
[60.88 - 66.64] my team tend to want to prove themselves
[63.96 - 68.56] now Anna was full of life her first job
[66.64 - 71.48] at eny was something she would have been
[68.56 - 73.60] very proud of but as soon as she started
[71.48 - 76.68] the excitement of her career turned into
[73.60 - 79.72] exhaustion late nights NeverEnding
[76.68 - 82.40] workloads the pressure to perform does
[79.72 - 85.24] this sound familiar if you're a hard
[82.40 - 88.40] worker it will I've been there I've done
[85.24 - 90.80] it it's the hustle culture which we have
[88.40 - 92.76] all come to accept as normal and as a
[90.80 - 95.20] health coach I think we need to take a
[92.76 - 97.60] moment to reflect is my body the most
[95.20 - 101.04] expensive real estate am I treating it
[97.60 - 106.16] well is my sleep good is my nutrition
[101.04 - 110.20] good is my brain functioning at normal
[106.16 - 112.68] or at peace let's be real for a second
[110.20 - 115.16] is it worth it her mother in a
[112.68 - 117.64] heartbreaking letter to eny India's
[115.16 - 120.76] chairman shared the painful details of
[117.64 - 123.64] Anna's last days her chest congestion
[120.76 - 126.36] her anxiety sleepless nights stress
[123.64 - 129.52] Beyond her capacity to handle she was
[126.36 - 133.16] exhausted yet she kept pushing her
[129.52 - 135.92] family begged her to quit her doctors
[133.16 - 138.00] warned her to rest but Anna felt like
[135.92 - 139.68] she couldn't stop she worked tirelessly
[138.00 - 141.64] into the night even on weekends
[139.68 - 144.12] collapsing onto her bed from sheer
[141.64 - 147.00] exhaustion only to be woken up by more
[144.12 - 149.00] messages asking for reports the cruel
[147.00 - 150.40] irony is that she was trying to prove
[149.00 - 153.36] herself
[150.40 - 155.88] but in the end her life was the price
[153.36 - 159.20] she paid this is the reality for many
[155.88 - 162.40] young professionals today we glorify
[159.20 - 165.56] over work we wear a burnout as a badge
[162.40 - 167.96] of honor but at what cost companies will
[165.56 - 170.56] always find a replacement Life Will Go
[167.96 - 172.44] On but Anna's family will never recover
[170.56 - 175.28] from this and all of those who are
[172.44 - 178.68] suffering from overw workload God forbid
[175.28 - 180.92] if you move on into the next life you
[178.68 - 183.84] cannot be replaced in your your family
[180.92 - 186.24] Anna story is not just a tragedy a
[183.84 - 188.60] wakeup call for all of us who think we
[186.24 - 191.64] need to sacrifice our health our
[188.60 - 194.48] well-being our sanity for Success Hassel
[191.64 - 196.36] culture has become a silent killer and
[194.48 - 198.72] for those of you just starting your
[196.36 - 201.44] careers I think it's time to change the
[198.72 - 204.92] narrative you see success doesn't need
[201.44 - 207.32] to come at the expense of your health I
[204.92 - 210.32] believe in what I call the office
[207.32 - 213.40] Olympian mindset where you treat your
[210.32 - 217.44] work like an athlete treats their sport
[213.40 - 219.80] it's about balance strategy and
[217.44 - 222.72] sustainability so how do you perform at
[219.80 - 225.88] your best without sacrificing yourself
[222.72 - 229.04] like Anna tragically did it starts with
[225.88 - 232.32] balance let me break it down for you
[229.04 - 234.88] number one the most important nutrition
[232.32 - 237.40] working late nights skipping meals
[234.88 - 239.88] forgetting your breakfast grabbing junk
[237.40 - 242.64] food because it's convenient too much of
[239.88 - 245.04] coffee too much of sugary Beverages and
[242.64 - 248.56] no nutrition at all all of this leads to
[245.04 - 251.48] a burnout instead I need you to focus on
[248.56 - 253.68] nutrient-rich Foods foods that fuel your
[251.48 - 256.60] brain and body not your taste bud think
[253.68 - 258.92] of it like meal preparing for a marathon
[256.60 - 262.60] if you're constantly Running on Empty
[258.92 - 264.48] you will eventually crash quick tips my
[262.60 - 267.76] favorite is start with small frequent
[264.48 - 270.32] meals nuts seeds and fruits are easy to
[267.76 - 272.88] carry snacks that you can Gra grab even
[270.32 - 275.80] during a busy day at work don't skip
[272.88 - 278.72] your breakfast and remember hydration is
[275.80 - 281.12] key dehydration leads to fatigue mood
[278.72 - 283.64] swings and even more stress I always
[281.12 - 286.08] tell all my young clients keep a water
[283.64 - 288.28] bottle at your workplace and monitor how
[286.08 - 290.92] much water you drink I cannot stress the
[288.28 - 292.40] importance for water good quality water
[290.92 - 294.48] in your workplace for your brain
[292.40 - 296.24] performance hydration prevents
[294.48 - 298.28] constipation which means you have a good
[296.24 - 300.96] bowel movement which means you don't
[298.28 - 304.20] keep toxins inside of you so drinking
[300.96 - 308.28] the right quantity of water is very key
[304.20 - 310.36] to a great energy in the workplace next
[308.28 - 313.24] exercise I'm not asking you to hit the
[310.36 - 316.08] gym for 2 hours after work even in my
[313.24 - 318.20] office I have bought gym memberships for
[316.08 - 320.20] various team members because I need them
[318.20 - 322.44] to work out but you could start with
[320.20 - 324.12] small movements even during your workday
[322.44 - 325.68] make a huge difference get up and talk
[324.12 - 327.68] to your mom and dad on the phone for 10
[325.68 - 330.72] minutes sitting on a desk all day takes
[327.68 - 333.24] a toll on your body so move walk take a
[330.72 - 335.28] trip down to the foyer get some sunshine
[333.24 - 337.28] walk on the grass take short walks use
[335.28 - 338.96] the stairs instead of the elevator treat
[337.28 - 341.80] your body like an athlete because in the
[338.96 - 343.88] corporate world stamina is everything
[341.80 - 346.44] and I don't mean stamina at a desk I
[343.88 - 349.68] mean stamina in terms of your lifestyle
[346.44 - 352.24] ability to treat it like an athlete set
[349.68 - 354.16] reminders every hour to stretch your
[352.24 - 356.44] body you'll be amazed at how it helps
[354.16 - 359.32] with a concentration mood I do a Surya
[356.44 - 362.56] namaskar at my desk get to the side I do
[359.32 - 365.64] a blank near my desk sometimes I do dips
[362.56 - 367.64] at my desk you can all do this the point

[393.28 - 397.64] snacking tips things that you can carry
[395.52 - 400.88] to the office and from my 21 minute
[397.64 - 402.76] fit.com website I will give you a manual
[400.88 - 404.88] of how you can do a quick workout to
[402.76 - 407.56] take care of your health and this
[404.88 - 411.08] something that a lot of us
[407.56 - 413.60] Overlook conscious breathing you might
[411.08 - 415.60] not realize it but in our stressful
[413.60 - 418.08] environments our breathing patterns
[415.60 - 419.32] change becoming very shallow and erratic
[418.08 - 421.32] you know you breathe in the top part of
[419.32 - 424.84] your
[421.32 - 427.04] instead of a long deep breath which
[424.84 - 430.32] is do you know when you breathe really
[427.04 - 432.80] deeply the bottom nerves at the bottom
[430.32 - 434.64] lobes of your lungs get activated and
[432.80 - 437.16] Signal your parasympathetic nervous
[434.64 - 440.28] system to relax so when you're on the go
[437.16 - 442.96] on the go shallow breathing conscious
[440.28 - 446.48] breathing can help you reset it's
[442.96 - 449.96] something as simple as taking a few deep
[446.48 - 453.12] breaths right where you are study show
[449.96 - 456.04] that slow mindful breathing calms the
[453.12 - 458.24] nervous system reduces stress and boosts
[456.04 - 461.52] mental Clarity between two Health
[458.24 - 464.56] coaching counselings I always do four
[461.52 - 467.72] long deep breaths try this with me
[464.56 - 470.84] inhale slowly through your nose for four
[467.72 - 470.84] counts and it goes like
[472.16 - 476.32] this hold for four
[477.88 - 482.32] counts exale for four
[486.28 - 491.84] counts repeat this a few times
[489.44 - 494.68] throughout the day do what I do after
[491.84 - 497.00] every call I do this for four breaths it
[494.68 - 499.16] really drops my stress levels when they
[497.00 - 501.12] high and I don't mean bad stress I mean
[499.16 - 502.80] even just work stress go go go go go go
[501.12 - 505.32] you need to reset your button for your
[502.80 - 508.00] mind and your body and now the most
[505.32 - 510.24] important thing listen to me carefully
[508.00 - 512.24] sleep is non-negotiable
[510.24 - 514.72] Anna pushed herself to work late into
[512.24 - 517.32] the night but your body needs to rest to
[514.72 - 519.76] recover just like an athlete after hard
[517.32 - 522.48] days of training you have to sleep
[519.76 - 525.80] create a bedtime routine disconnect from
[522.48 - 528.92] work at night I at home keep shouting at
[525.80 - 530.68] my clients please shut down after 9:00
[528.92 - 533.20] don't look at your work don't look at
[530.68 - 536.08] your phones aim for 7 to 8 hours of
[533.20 - 537.80] quality sleep now this is one thing that
[536.08 - 541.52] I need you to do you see when you look
[537.80 - 544.56] at your phone you get anxiety and when
[541.52 - 547.08] you get anxiety you can't sleep so about
[544.56 - 549.72] 2 hours before you go to bed don't
[547.08 - 552.16] activate your mind towards anxiety and
[549.72 - 555.12] anxiety is the killer of you going to
[552.16 - 556.68] sleep quick and fast lack of sleep is
[555.12 - 558.48] directly linked to anxiety po
[556.68 - 561.32] performance and eventually burnout my
[558.48 - 564.72] friend Dr Shane Cado has actually shown
[561.32 - 567.40] me the studies in his book where the
[564.72 - 570.04] hippocampus is where memories and
[567.40 - 573.24] learning happen and if you sleep lesser
[570.04 - 575.92] by 2 hours the next day you have a 40%
[573.24 - 578.56] lesser productivity at work so when I
[575.92 - 581.48] have a day of shooting videos like this
[578.56 - 583.32] I sleep longer I go to bed earlier I eat
[581.48 - 585.04] my last meal 3 hours before going to
[583.32 - 588.68] sleep you see the problem is not your
[585.04 - 591.08] wake up the problem is setting the same
[588.68 - 593.12] time to sleep every day if you have a
[591.08 - 595.08] high stress job if you need to perform
[593.12 - 598.24] if you want to get that bonus which will
[595.08 - 600.76] take you to the next promotion work hard
[598.24 - 604.24] but sleep even harder with the right
[600.76 - 605.52] discipline and finally mental health I
[604.24 - 608.72] think this is something we all take for
[605.52 - 611.64] granted Anna's anxiety and stress were
[608.72 - 614.88] warning signs don't ignore them it's
[611.64 - 617.28] okay to ask for help please come to me
[614.88 - 618.72] and tell me Ryan I need help I will find
[617.28 - 621.04] you people in the country or health
[618.72 - 622.92] coaches in fact it's really a strength
[621.04 - 625.28] whether it's talking to a mentor a
[622.92 - 626.96] therapist or even a friend don't carry
[625.28 - 629.64] that burden alone don't talk to your
[626.96 - 632.08] boss talk to a friend talk talk to a
[629.64 - 634.16] mentor talk to your parents and listen
[632.08 - 637.00] to your parents if your parents say
[634.16 - 639.44] don't work this hard it's not worth it I
[637.00 - 641.28] think they your best brand ambassadors
[639.44 - 644.28] you need to work hard for your future
[641.28 - 646.48] just like your parents did but sometimes
[644.28 - 648.48] just speaking to your parents allows you
[646.48 - 649.96] to get it off your chest because then
[648.48 - 651.96] you know you're not in this journey
[649.96 - 654.68] alone somebody's there with you and if
[651.96 - 656.60] your spouse is there if you have a
[654.68 - 659.08] spouse who's working really hard what
[656.60 - 660.96] you could do is make some camomile tea
[659.08 - 662.48] with whenever my wife works late I ask
[660.96 - 664.32] her hey babes would you like some
[662.48 - 666.24] collagen or would you like some camomile
[664.32 - 667.84] tea and she'll think for 2 minutes she's
[666.24 - 669.56] like I'm so busy don't trouble me don't
[667.84 - 671.80] disturb me right now and then 2 minutes
[669.56 - 673.88] later she'll shout out babes I'd like
[671.80 - 676.96] some camomile tea and I'm off to make
[673.88 - 679.12] some camomile tea for her the reason is
[676.96 - 682.48] when your spouse or your girlfriend or
[679.12 - 685.56] your boyfriend works with you you have a
[682.48 - 687.16] lower anxiety because of the love that
[685.56 - 689.36] you receive from your parents or your
[687.16 - 691.88] companion make sure that you get that
[689.36 - 693.84] and if you live alone it can be very
[691.88 - 697.00] stressful living alone do you know what
[693.84 - 699.56] you could do play some great music which
[697.00 - 701.48] puts you to sleep or when you get up in
[699.56 - 703.84] the morning do what I did for many years
[701.48 - 706.00] when I was single I played my best songs
[703.84 - 708.44] which just picked me up and I got to
[706.00 - 711.48] work and I said yes I can take on this
[708.44 - 714.40] challenge now companies too need to
[711.48 - 716.64] change in my company I'm not only a
[714.40 - 718.08] health coach but I'm also the founder
[716.64 - 720.16] and I've got to take care of my
[718.08 - 723.20] employees so we as as companies need to
[720.16 - 726.24] change and HRS out there I'm calling you
[723.20 - 728.76] out I work with a lot of HRS and they
[726.24 - 730.72] reject health and wellness programs
[728.76 - 733.24] especially the foreign companies tend to
[730.72 - 735.32] do this it's a lot of lip service you
[733.24 - 738.24] should stop doing lip service and you
[735.32 - 740.80] need to be genuinely involved with your
[738.24 - 743.52] employees because employees today are
[740.80 - 745.04] asking in addition to giving me a salary
[743.52 - 746.72] what are you doing for me and the one
[745.04 - 749.24] thing that you can do companies for your
[746.72 - 751.56] employee is begin to guide your employee
[749.24 - 753.60] way on a work life balance yes you are
[751.56 - 755.44] doing that but on taking care of their
[753.60 - 756.96] health you need to look at their sleep
[755.44 - 758.84] you need to look at their nutrition you
[756.96 - 761.36] need to look at the exercise so
[758.84 - 763.56] corporate culture must prioritize
[761.36 - 766.16] employee well-being over short-term

[893.12 - 897.92] feel guilty of taking care of your
[895.04 - 899.92] health I keep asking my guys guys who
[897.92 - 901.80] went to the gym yesterday day and they
[899.92 - 903.96] always look at me sheepishly sir we had
[901.80 - 905.84] a podcast to release there was no too
[903.96 - 907.56] much of time I'm talking to my cameraman
[905.84 - 910.12] sitting behind me and I'm my video

[910.12 - 915.44] of your health and when I say we I mean
[912.60 - 918.24] the system of living

[918.24 - 923.32] Sebastian's peral story is heartbreaking
[921.20 - 926.04] it doesn't have to be repeated let's
[923.32 - 928.32] honor her memory by making sure we don't
[926.04 - 931.12] fall into the same trap of hustle
[928.32 - 933.84] culture remember your worth is not
[931.12 - 936.76] measured by the number of hours you work
[933.84 - 939.56] but how well you live your life now
[936.76 - 940.84] before you stop this video hang on a bit
[939.56 - 943.52] there's a lot of things that you could
[940.84 - 945.56] do number one get a blood test done I'm
[943.52 - 947.44] sharing the link in the descript the
[945.56 - 950.20] video is over but for for those of you
[947.44 - 951.84] who stayed this far I'm sharing the link
[950.20 - 954.08] of how you can do a blood test you want
[951.84 - 956.80] to do your liver enzymes kidney enzymes
[954.08 - 959.84] cholesterol profile and you should be
[956.80 - 961.56] doing the lipoprotein lipoprotein B
[959.84 - 963.64] homoy because these are the cardiac
[961.56 - 965.76] markers because a lot of your stress
[963.64 - 968.28] affects your heart the other thing that
[965.76 - 970.36] I want you to also do is keep a Tracker
[968.28 - 973.36] of how much of water you drink every day
[970.36 - 976.48] and best of all when you go to work can
[973.36 - 978.92] you carry a fruit or two with you I
[976.48 - 981.12] think that allows you to prevent acidity
[978.92 - 983.00] and constipation thereby keeping good
[981.12 - 985.12] gut health I don't know if you know this
[983.00 - 988.24] we actually do a microb testing which is
[985.12 - 991.24] a poop or a stool analysis and we can
[988.24 - 993.64] actually see the anxiety bacteria go up
[991.24 - 996.08] and the good bacteria that calm you and
[993.64 - 999.04] all of this can be reprogrammed by
[996.08 - 1000.96] exercising and changing your diet so
[999.04 - 1002.84] parents if you're listening this far and
[1000.96 - 1004.92] you want to gift your kids something
[1002.84 - 1006.44] this Diwali or this Christmas or for
[1004.92 - 1007.84] that matter you just love your kid and
[1006.44 - 1010.64] you want to gift your kids something
[1007.84 - 1012.28] when they're next home hit us up at the
[1010.64 - 1014.16] Quan nutrition clinics and we'll send
[1012.28 - 1015.32] you the list of blood test don't tell
[1014.16 - 1017.00] your kid you're getting a blood test
[1015.32 - 1018.60] done just make sure they don't party the
[1017.00 - 1020.24] previous night there's no alcohol in
[1018.60 - 1022.64] their system they're not gone for a run
[1020.24 - 1025.08] or a workout they've slept well on a
[1022.64 - 1027.80] fasted State get a blood sample done
[1025.08 - 1030.20] because you know what data and numbers
[1027.80 - 1032.40] shock your child into taking care of
[1030.20 - 1034.80] their health in addition to that you
[1032.40 - 1037.76] could give them an exercise program with
[1034.80 - 1040.00] a trainer you could also give them a
[1037.76 - 1041.36] diet plan which they can follow at work
[1040.00 - 1045.08] I know it's difficult for a lot of
[1041.36 - 1047.48] Bachelor kids out there but just making
[1045.08 - 1050.56] healthier choices and I think if I talk
[1047.48 - 1053.56] to my team we should be able to give you
[1050.56 - 1056.20] healthy snacking recipe options at work
[1053.56 - 1058.20] which you can go to your e-commerce apps
[1056.20 - 1060.68] and probably select those options which
[1058.20 - 1063.32] are much healthier both for your mental
[1060.68 - 1065.28] health your digestive health and overall
[1063.32 - 1067.96] make you an office Olympia now if this
[1065.28 - 1071.20] story has resonated with you if you have
[1067.96 - 1073.72] felt the same pressures let's start a
[1071.20 - 1075.08] conversation you could like my channel
[1073.72 - 1077.08] you could share this video with your
[1075.08 - 1079.12] colleagues better still share it with
[1077.08 - 1081.76] your HR and said Ryan fernandos said to
[1079.12 - 1083.32] send it to you because we want more
[1081.76 - 1085.48] Healthcare seminars we want more
[1083.32 - 1087.64] Healthcare benefits in our company share
[1085.48 - 1090.80] it with your friends with your managers
[1087.64 - 1093.12] I want us to create a work culture that
