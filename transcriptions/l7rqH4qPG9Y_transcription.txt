genetic testing blood testing and above all we look at scientific studies and then look at a high of 40 of us coming together and sharing our collective mind resources in terms of deciding whether we should give somebody a fish oil capsule we should give something cinema or you pick up of glutamine or why is beings going to be part of your you should connect with other medium so upfront navy beans black beans rajma china are going to be the guys that release rice and wheat in your diet the reason being is green is contributing too much of carbohydrate and the FTO gene which is based on carbohydrate sensitivity is actually see in a lot of Asian population that you don't need so much of grain in your diet you actually need more rajma China black beans or navy beans now researchers show people that is more about the leaves and I have a / a trauma and I've seen this in good client within recommended big meals for breakfast every morning or football ability I can't eat anything more because I'm so fully to the amount of protein the good carotid complex diverted that sustains you to the entire league yes I've heard reports works 2016-2017 but beans trust me is going to be the 2010 DB mantra so why is I may be shooting grain down a lot of us require some amount of great debt to drink because you need that because you need to stop ahead race so if you're in country I do like brown rice and I want you to go organic but most of the rules this year in 2080 try and attempt to buy organic because you're lessening the load in developing in terms the chemical processing so you live longer you're less cancer risk associated and brown rice well most of us more likely because Leslie pressure-cook you can do a brown basmati rice is what I say I calculated portions of akuto we are in ugly I normally have my brown rice and that's possible today but I need to keep our moving around in the office and towards the night Dean and my vegetables the other point that I wanted to focus on this year in 2080 will be cinnamon research showed that cinnamon okay are not four grams of cinnamon a day split up into small speakers moving your meals about your food salad hot cinnamon is able to reduce this little part and belly fat by up to four percent and cinnamon boosts incident sensitivity the number one criteria when people have triglycerides and cholesterol problem is because of an insulin resistance cinnamon is one component that is able to move you in the direction of better sugar management which in turn keeps you slimmer and healthier I not be true it because of anything and has long along with spinach because both beetroot and spinach have something on a slightly new path of dilation which means it dilates of blood vessels now beetroot above all because it's red in color and the pigment of red is going to have high anti-cancer properties especially keeping your clinic and I'd like to call as the municipality cleaner of your entire internal system now most people get beetroot the apple beet root juice is said to be don't like it I have discovered a new recipe and 2018 you should try this out be food alba make sure to block the organic taste would be fruit with more amount of raisins almonds and cashews and here ILD fact is not the problem sugar is the problem so when making this beautiful da try and make sure that you lessen the amount of sugar being used to prepare a little foie gras 92018 a new trend set up for me it's always been there my grandmother's - period your grandmother has done at your mother's done it my mother's done it offense so there we might have given to you the breakfast table I think our men should make a comeback because it's nutritiously back and I think the problem is everyone knows almonds are good we just have that habit anymore today's fast-paced lifestyle so in 2018 what I'm saying to you is traditional knowledge that the other team and my team are had let's bring it back let's have 10 hours every morning sort the previous night for breakfast and when you feel it remember me right now finally in terms of my self defense I'm definitely gonna wanting you to have an omega-3 because it does vasodilation improves not function you lose the cholesterol profile boosts HDL cholesterol so if I am NOT eating fish three times a week then I want to get a special biopsy with me if you're a few of your vegetarian then you can try and look at boosting your omega-3 why of flax seeds a flaxseed oil supplements are also available additionally this year in your cabinet make sure you have more amount of zinc sulfate okay or zinc gluconate because you see most immune system is in our clinic at we have hundreds of people coming in and we do a lot of blood testing and additional mineral testing now what we are finding out is that people are lacking in certain minerals and zinc is one of them now Zeke is responsible for boosting your immune system if you notice 2017 they're both far more greater number of coughs and colds in your family check it out just recon this year 2018 keeper Daria who has had what cold when and how much it for how long because I am seeing people coming into updating with documenting assessment on an annual plan we seek there are a lot of people lost there are a lot of cool so we brought in sync to boost zinc in the blood and it also boosts testosterone Sookie are working on you also have been funding levels of testosterone in your Walker both men and women so Singh's gonna contribute to that you can take zinc continuously for a month or two and then take a break for a month or wetterstedt what I do is I take zinc on an alternate basis whenever a copper core is coming on I can feel the the the you know the mucous about the start or fielder could sneak in the throat then I stop taking that sake twice a day on that day to boost my system yes everyone says vitamin C but everyone knows about vitamin C I'm seeing brilliant zinc in 2018 and above all my favorite is glutamine powder glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the skeletal muscle 60% of your skeletal muscle is made up of glutamine so you wanna have a scoop of glutamine in your orange juice wine a beverage or even in your green tea and when you're having this cocoa I mean it's also going to boost says the body Siddartha I'm gonna service the muscle and I wanna service the immune system so when you are clearly not more your muscles drop the glutamine resources as it is that all the element in the body will you eat it goes to the muscles and the immune system says oh my dear I don't have any new to me for me so maybe a supplementation can work I am allergic to build routine because of the milk and the lactose in it so what I try to do is I can't have a plant-based protein this year her discovered 2000 eating a pretty expensive new product no by the way there's no declaration I'm not running anything from this company I don't even know who the company owners are just not the product it's brilliant it's expensive amazing grass it's an organic proving power and it contains also the pea protein here routine quinoa reading and ham cooking now in India this is going to be bad because FSSA I said is that you cannot have improved in sold in India it's not on the list of food products so you most likely gonna have to even port de Skynet heaven packs the seal pound weight of protein as compared to even meat protein so it's one of those any lifters and dogs of the plant protein family and those were handsome other winding greens of it our diets are very acidic to this the more fruits be greater so the last body grass alfalfa's filled in after Elana broccoli and spinach now is this one that I have is a chocolate peanut butter flavor I really like it to have one not scoop which is 40 grams only about 20 grams of protein so those of you our fitness fanatics and those are fitness enthusiast and fitness experts you're going to come back to me and say yeah but there's only 50 percent protein in that I am working from a holistic perspective of lifestyle where I want the elements of anything else besides only protein to comment to my body keep in mind I'm also focused on dietary protein so what I'm recommending all of these things of recommending these food digesting these books and giving you snippets of information 2018 has to be about a simple mother go organic get better quality nutrition into you and above all I would ask you have you done a personal nutrition gene test because that's going to be the number one fundamental shift in 2018
