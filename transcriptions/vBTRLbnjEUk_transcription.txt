Transcript: hey everyone i wanted to make uh a cardiac reversal tip for the year in 2022. so i've recently launched the cardiac rehabilitation diet division in koa nutrition my name is ryan fernando and i'm holding not a cricket ball but probably what is the most powerful most powerful fruit for heart disease and that's the pomegranate an apple a day does not keep the doctor away but i think a pomegranate is going to do it for you so i've been doing a little bit of research and i wanted to share my screen with you and it's going to be a little bit technical in a little bit long but those of you who come from a family history of heart attacks heart disease high cholesterol taking statins you might just want to listen to this for five minutes to convince you scientifically drug wise scientifically the proper scientific research paper on why this fruit is worth its weight in gold so let's get started i want to share my screen uh this is the study pomegranate for cardiovascular health if you want a copy of this study and you want to read it or show it to your cardiologist or your heart doctor then please ask me for it i digested it today and when digesting it today look at this okay 73 patients with at least one cardiovascular risk consumed pj pj's pomegranate juice 240 ml per day for one year and they show trends to increase arterial elasticity meaning if my blood vessels are a pipeline as i grow older my arteries become harder so they can't expand and take the blood pressure so if there is a blockage or a lesion it tends to burst or rupture over there so if it's flexible like a rubber hose lesser chances of ruptures so this is very very important on uh arterial elasticity i also give collagen i also give collagen for arterial elasticity but i did not know that pomegranate juice can improve arterial elasticity now what they did is they found people who had coronary heart disease and what they did is they investigated uh pomegranate juice consumption on patients with carotid artery stenosis meaning inside the pipeline there's all cut does and there's all bumps and everything and blockages and plaque and everything now 10 patients were supplemented with pomegranate juice for one year 10 guys 10 people and 9 people did not consume pomegranate blood samples were collected at 3 6 9 and 12 months on the pomegranate juice and they measured the carrot intima media thickness cimt that's basically the thickness of the carroted artery which is here in the neck okay and they compared these 10 guys who took the pomegranate and the control group who did not take very interestingly in the control group meaning the people who did not take the pomegranate juice their cmt increased means the blockages the plaque formation increased went up by 10 percent but in the pomegranate juice there was up to a 35 percent reduction i was mind blown when i read the study i'm like why isn't the medical community not adding pomegranate to your diet now look at this pomegranate consumption revealed a gradual reduction of 13 in the first three months 22 26 and by the ninth month you went up to as high as 26 to 35 percent so that was amazing okay so this is one thing fine you're not convinced that you should eat pomegranate let me go to the next part that they discovered one of the thing is a boss you have bad cholesterol ldl cholesterol when it gets oxidized matlab hey glucose come there fat food food start slapping cholesterol era cholesterol molecules sticky buns glucose gives one shot to the cholesterol this is called peroxidase oxidation so oxidation happens on the ldl the bad guy and it becomes sticky and we have found this in the angiographically documented scans where they find the plaques and everything so what they said over here was it was found that increased oxidative stress was observed in non-insulin type 2 diabetes so most people who have diabetes also are having high cholesterol but the diabetes are going and doing tap tube tube and doing all gundagiri to the cholesterol making it sticky increasing your atherosclerosis or plaque formation but on consumption of 50 ml of pomegranate juice per day for a period of three months there was a significant reduction in the basal serum thio barbutric acid relative substances the simplest way i can explain this to you is that this t bars is like a testing to measure the the oxidation of the cholesterol how bad is it okay and this tea bass test says with pomegranate juice your gunda giri slapping that is happening on the plaque is reducing by 28 percent what do you want to do in heart disease what do you want to do in diabetes we want to reduce the cholesterol plaque formation i just think pomegranate needs to be part of your diet hang on still not yet convinced let's go further further in carotid artery stenosis pomegranate consumption by these patients resulted in a significant reduction in the basal level of ldl associated lipid peroxidases by 43 89 86 and a whopping 90 after 12 months you know i read this study and i was like i've got to share this with the world i mean even if the world doesn't want to watch this and even if you don't share it with anyone i don't care if i can save one person's life because they start eating pomegranates every day and take 240 ml of juice god bless you for listening into this video and i hope you live an extra decade because you start eating a pomegranate do you know what i am doing i'm searching to buy a pomegranate farm i think i want to buy a pomegranate farm if anyone has a pomegranate farm uh please message me i want to buy your pomegranate farm i think it's a food worth its weight in gold still not yet convinced hang on hang on a little bit more in this study okay uh where was that yeah in this carotid artery stenosis patients systolic bp was reduced by seven percent 11 10 and 12 after 12 months so most bp patients most diabetic patients are taking bp medication well i mean ryan 10 is not enough but here's my thought process what if i could give you a food that lowers your bp so any of my clients who have a higher bp i would say let's add a pomegranate by the way when i had the continuous glucose monitor on my arm and tracking my sugar when i drank orange juice my sugar went up when i drank pomegranate juice my sugar went down now i'm not saying that we should blindly give pomegranate juice to people with diabetes but what you could do is take a pin prick and check after half an hour and after 90 60 and 90 minutes is the sugar in a patient who's given pomegranate juice maybe at around 11 o'clock between two meals or at four o'clock between two meals and if the sugar doesn't go up you can take pomegranate juice and that's the bio individual approach that i would give you final part of the whole study which is macrophages are basically improved triglyceride is improved and oxidized lipids accumulation all improve because of the consumption of pomegranate juice so what are you waiting for carotid lesions also contained less cholesterol which means those bumps had lesser sticky cholesterol in them because of the pomegranate and i remember the first one 35 reduction in black formation it is the drain x it is the drainage to clean up now don't make mistaken my uh my enthusiasm to go off your medication because there's one more thing i want to tell you they found out patience on statin which is the drug that doctor gives you please take your statins if your doctors give you it saves uh from incidences of clots blah blah blah blah there's a huge benefit in taking statins yes it does cause muscle fatigue it lowers your coenzyme q10 so your nutritionist should give you coenzyme q10 but they did this study with statins plus pomegranate juice and what they found out was mind-blowing for me when i read this which is uh there are these two guys okay uh puni seg glasin uh which is punishic acid which is found in the seeds so you got to eat the seeds okay grind the seeds and beta steetosterol now both of these are found in pomegranate and they combine it with the statin called simvastatin now what they found out was the reduction in the cholesterol biosynthesis rate was down reduced by 42 percent as compared to person only taking statin so that for me was very interesting that is my doctor would not have to be give me aggressive statin i would take the statin with the pomegranate get my cholesterol down and then as the months proceed if i'm an initial heart cardiac patient i'm cleaning up my arteries over one two years such that after two three years of consecutive no high homocysteine no high lipoprotein a lipoprotein b ldl is very good you can probably be weaned off your statin okay so i don't know what more do you require for me to consume synwastatin decreased macrophages reactive oxygen species formation by 11 ros is uh the free radical damage that can happen at that area so it's almost saying like you're giving a spa to your blood from getting agitated around the cholesterol plaque uh significant inhibition was noted at 61 to 79 percent now people would say oh there were only 10 people in the study or it was only five people was the pomegranate gourd was a pomegranate bad i'm a nutritionist i can't argue that medicines are not good and not have a scientific backing but when a paper is done on a pomegranate juice and it's out there scientifically documented my job is to get it to you so you can get it to your doctor and they may brush it off but if anybody's worth their weight in gold understands a scientific document and takes the time to read this they will start writing pomegranate as a prescription for heart health the cardiac division is now live at kwan nutrition it's been my lifelong mission to change the way everybody eats and i hope this one video makes you buy a pomegranate and not for one day for the next 365 days oh by the way i did the calculation so here in india i assumed 90 rupees for a pomegranate cost per day it's going to cost us 32 000 rupees per year the cost of one stent is 40 000 rupees not counting the admission fees doctors fees everything else and the pain and the suffering that you go through oh my god i'm going to get a heart attack i think if you want to live life till the age of 100 buy a pomegranate eat one every day i hope to see you uh in person and if i ever meet you and this videos influ influenced you please gift me a pomegranate god bless you you
