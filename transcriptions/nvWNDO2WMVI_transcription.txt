Transcript: recently a patient who came back with severe nerve damage after getting an IV drip from a salon so if you go to a completely unqualified untrained person major things can go wrong what you may think is just an acne cream or what you may think is just a small laser may actually cause a lot of harm if you're not done in the right way if not you could actually go blind is this why it's better to take a face massage at a Dermatology Clinic rather than one of these Spas where that person like like rubbing your face and going at it how important is nutrition to you to me skin is just literally like a diagnostic tool for what's happening inside for example if there's anemia skin is pale if there's excess sugar skin looks dark protein goes down you can actually see brittle hair brittle nails so everything is about what you have put into you is what is seen outside I think our grandmothers were younger because they also didn't kill themselves to stay lean I stayed you won't believe between 50 and 53 kgs all my life and these days teenagers are so paranoid about losing their hair this is huge right now they are scared to wash their hair they think washing hair leads to hair fall which is a big myth now what do I do all of us want to look younger what is the difference between Botox and filler yeah that is a slightly controversial topic in today's episode Dr Rashmi setti a top celebrity dermatologist my friend and now my Confidant for my skin is here to talk to me about skin care diet and how you can have Flawless skin and you know what all celebrities need Flawless skin for their earning but what about you and me I wish I could go back in time and meet Dr Rashmi shetti when I was 18 years of age age when I did not have any knowledge when I did not have

person makes you and me look more and more beautiful as we grow older Dr Rashmi welcome to my podcast great to have you here today thank you Ryan I've actually been waiting for a chitchat with you because I have my own personal questions about nutrition I know and you know I I wanted to ask you this question which is uh when I came in I was like I forgot my biochemistry from Goa Medical College and my Dean would say Ryan you need to be better so my first question was is skin dead or is skin alive and I was wondering where which part is dead and which part is alive so portion of it is dead obviously a large portion is alive only the top layer the stratum coronium is almost a dead layer is a dead layer so it's just the Keratin that is put out with let's say clumped melanin what is this keratin keratin is a protein so cells die and become protein whether it is here or um I'm sure you dive deep into anti-aging molecular sence yourself so if you look at the mtor theory it is dead protein which is hanging around various tissues which cause the inflammation so any tissue which kind of stops its function grows and finishes its function and dies now in skin we die and we throw that out correct so we share a lot of skin every day yeah you every day you end up there was some um person I can't remember the name said that it was in a movie controversially said how a whole load of dust in the house is skin cells skin cells so it it was in a controversial skin of color movie so it it is it skin there which is actually dead and fallen down um so the Dead part of the skin is the outermost layer of the outer layer so you have the dermis and the EP epidermis right the epidermis is the outer layer so EP is the outer layer correct EP is the outer so there is dermis which is Derm is skin dermology comes from there okay so there is dermis then there is epidermis then there is subdermis also so these are the pretty much layers of the skin that you feel underneath subdermis is usually the fat that you see in the skin then you have the dermis which is the layer where there is lot of blood vessels collagen elastin ground substance all of that that makes the bulk of the skin is it true that the skin is the largest organ in the human body it's enveloping and wrapping the whole thing right so it is the largest if you consider skin an organ yeah then it is the largest body surface Dr Rashmi tell me something is skin also there in Our arteries and blood vessels could we call that skin or that's something different no that is that is that is um endothelium we call it so that is different that behaves very differently so you know if I was like a construction guy and I had to construct a house I use bricks in the bathroom I use bricks in the hall I use bricks in the but you would do various the bricks inside the house and the outside you are making it weatherproof so the brick would be different so outside you may use a slightly rougher material but you are more trying to do a barrier so it shouldn't you know put water inside from the rain water cannot get absorbed and get into your house so thinking of various properties for that brick while an endothelium is a different kind of a brick where you're looking at more for example the gut endothelium you're looking at some kind of exchange there or the endothelium of your let's say the lung or this now explains to me why a dermatologist is not a gastroenterologist so so for everyone out there the simplest term is a dermatologist is a skin doctor so in India a dermatologist is not just a dermatologist our degree is either a DVD or a ddv or an MD in dermatology our whole body is called as Indian association of dermatologist venerology and leolist okay so it's the DV is diseases of skin sexually transmitted diseases and leprosy so in India the degree is all of this put together but a lot of us don't practice everything okay for example I've never seen leprosy patients after my passing out of college so if somebody would come to me it would be disservice for me to say just because I have the degree I can treat leprosy because I don't know the latest advances or I don't know what is medicine at the end of the day practice it's still called a practice right so if I haven't practiced seeing venerology or leprology for this many years I'm not best at it so when you say you practice what is your normal day like oh my God crazy it is now I in practice or in general to day both in general I wake up I was I was joking yesterday with one of my cousins 5 57 or 5:51 is when I wake up and it'll be the same for many many many many days unless something changes so I wake up as precisely as that without an alarm Okay so I wake up at around that 550 is and then um yeah I just love to see the sun watch the sunrise and I'm lucky that from my home I can watch the sun literally come out of the Horizon so I stand there and watch the sunrise and then I have a dog I play with her for some time I have my little hot water with some dip in the morning I do that I have my thyroid medication and yeah so the daily chores of the morning I I like to do my temple little Temple where I put the flower and the flow all of that I like to water my own little garden whatever little we have in Bombay so I do all of that and by 8 I'm on my computer desk where I finish off my emails blah blah all of that because I lecture a lot globally there is something or the other lecture that I need to prepare so I'm preparing in the morning that's it 9 I'm getting ready 9:45 I'm out to the clinic then we see anywhere between our 40 to 45 patients every day so it's a continuous and I am very particular about seeing every patient myself we did have Junior doctors earlier dmats to take the initial history do a few things but somehow I thought unless I ga the history myself something is missing so tell me something for the uninitiated out there who everyone wants to look beautiful today wants to have great skin the skin is the largest organ yeah when there are two types of ways to look at it one is I've got a problem like I had adult acne all my life so I got a problem fair enough but you have clear skin yeah so I'm assuming that when you're 25 years of age what would be the reason for you to go and meet Ault matologist from a maintenance point of view so let's divide it into two parts right one part is the prevention the preventive um servicing that we can do and then there's something which is there's a problem yeah so what's your take on what age should we start looking at prevention yeah uh what are the things that we need to do in prevention and then we'll go into the people who have got cudas like me on my face and we we have dermatologists on speed dialing like what can I do doctor I do okay so by and large I keep telling patients when you go to a doctor or even look at your own skin and plan what you want to do two main things like you necessarily said skin problem and skin goal skin goal goal okay yeah so you may have like you said I have smooth skin but my skin goal at this age is to maintain my hydration and make my skin look as youthful mhm as I would like it to be so that's my skin goal for the longest time mhm and maybe prevent pigmentation at this time in my life so these are my skin goals but what are my skin V or problems is the other thing that I want to deal with um I have an itchy eye sometimes so I want to prevent that around the eye because I don't want crinkly eye coming and when when an itchy eye is there and you scratch it the BL capillaries around the ey so delicate when you do this it kind of breaks and it may add to your dark Circle A lot of times it's justop I was about to ask you about dark circles just allergy at Toopy so-called hay fever what we call you know sensitization atopic dysis you call so all of these come under a category where you can have early morning sneezing itchy eye itchy nose and you end up doing this to your eye you're disrupting and Breaking All the capillaries and it leaks the blood and what happens to all that hemosiderin or the pigment in the blood it just sits there between the tissue and as you grow older your lymphatic drainage from this area becomes poorer and poorer what is lym lymphatic drainage so lymphatic drain so there is blood vessels mhm there is artery which gets the good blood from the heart to the rest of your body to function the to pull it back is I studied I stud a little B fantastic so way to pull it all back for the main fact call a bad blood correct and it'll clean it up and it'll send it back again from the from the lungs and then heart will pump it everywhere else correct now there is one more thing which adds so all this blood vessels whether it is vein or artery can leak away somewhere a little and some fluid can be just sitting in your tissue micro leaks it's not that blood is leaking some serum leaks away there is leak from the let's say gut here there everywhere so that leaky fluid which is there sometimes simply inflammation will bring in fluid to a tissue all of this will be sitting there and they will also be pulled by other channels which are lymphatic channels lymph is a fluid now that is then taken out so if you see a lot of massure they'll tell you lymphatic drainage so they will say you massage from here and then massage from here but they have to be really good at that P they will have to be really good at that they have to know the anatomy of the other it could damage your skin yeah you should know which direction you should know where your lymphatic lymph nodes are is this why it's better to take a face massage at a Dermatology Clinic rather than one of these Spas where that person like like rubbing your face and going at it very hard yeah but I must also say in their defense today if you see the curriculum of a legitimate Spa therapist or a massure they trained they yeah they go through some I think noway a lot of Spas have dermatologists as part of the team and everything yeah that is a slightly controversial topic whether we should be included in a spa spa should be included in a Dermatology Center all this is now getting very merging but you need to be if you give ADV if you to give advice to me M and say that um okay doc I want to go to a spa but I want to be going to a spa when the people are good doc I want to go to uh Dermatology Clinic to maybe prevent pigmentation acne uh look younger what should I be looking for in the Dermatology Clinic and what should be looking for in the spa as per your expertise thank you for this question because I've had recently a patient who came back with severe complications after getting an IV drip from a salon yeah and I have another patient who came back to me a few months ago who came with severe facial irritation not just irritation she ended up actually having a slight little nerve damage after doing an equipment energy based equipment in a salon so she says I was sitting doing my pedicure this oh you're doing a pedicure let's just run a drip or you're doing a manicure let's just just finish off your some hu or some RF on the face so please don't do these things because as easy as these equipments look one it's very difficult for you as a lay man to say if the equipment firstly is legitimate or not so there is an us FDA there is a European FDA which is called a c Mark there is a Korean FDA there is an Indian every company of course has their own FDA for the tool us FDA is the most stringent for the unin ated out there what does FDA mean Food and Drug Administration correct I was thinking for a second suddenly yeah because Food and Drug Administration the tools also go through the same that's what I was about to ask you is it only the medicine or is it the tools also the medical tools also go go through this so if you're buying equipment for your clinic you're looking for that as a doctor but as a as a lay man I would not know what that equipment would be and today the equipment manufacturers the MEO or the copy equipment manufacturers have become so brilliant they make the outer body look exactly like the original machine and the name there will be slightly different where you can't even make out that what is different if you if you really don't know so the whole point first is when you go when you're looking at anything there are three four things you need to do one look at the doctor and know that know what her qualifications are so do do you think it's right like I remember I took my dad to a doctor and I said doctor if you don't mind may I know your qualifications that's does a patient can a patient ask the doctor birth right your Birthright to do that like a so this one very sweet patient from a small town came in and uh you know how I always get these teenagers or these 20 something and the parents with them mhm and uh I can see this Dynamics because I have a 20 something at home so it's like always mother talks father talks like come on come on come on we be happening okay so like don't embarrass us come on we'll be happening so here the same thing happens that mother will be complaining something the children will have eyes open wide whatever our parents we be dis our parents kind come on come on we be happen what happened in this inci so that parent said I want to know your degree it was so sweet I was like I'm so glad you're doing this and child was like come on what's Happening like you can't ask a doctor this I'm like no you must and more people should ask what is the qualification of the doctor because it is very important what you may think is just an acne cream or what you may think is just a small laser may actually cause a lot of harm if you're not done in the right way medicines today especially in India everything is aaable OTC and everyone's self-prescribing right yeah because everything is available OTC and there are so many so-called skincare experts on the wide space of I want to talk to you about this now I mean we are experts but then I always tell my team doctors are the true experts they are qualified they're not certified yeah all these influencers are certified and they're doing these in Instagram videos and all what certification also we don't know that is never mind so so coming back to the clinic the lady asked you about your qualifications so I very happy I so I was I want to say that I ended up of course explaining to them this this this is my qualification so I want everyone to be able to ask their doctors and don't shy away from it what is it so if you're going in for let's say a hair removal laser or simply a Botox a filler a peel a facial you could maybe also go now I don't know is going to troll me for this but you could end up going in for an mbbs Doctor Who's called as an aesthetic physician or a cosmetic physician aesthetic physician or a cosmetic physician that physician is the stressful stressing term here now there also you need to make sure there are a lot of doctors who are not from mbbs could be a BHMs or could be something else which cannot be prescribing you certain medicines so you need to be very careful when you say mbbs doctors they are Bor so it's not that they don't know any one thing we also have a small little Dermatology posting but you're not a master of Dermatology who would you recruit into your clinic you are a global speaker teacher you have your own Clinic yeah who would you recruit into your clinic because then I know that Dr Rashi is recruiting the right person so that's the doctor to be going to yeah so I would only recruit A specialized dermatologist that's number one mhm um two in my hydrobat clinic I did have one of the doctors who are mbbs because there are times that an like I said there are certain things an mbbs can do under a guidance of a derat they're just Physicians they're Physicians so they're still mbbs they are not non-physicians so they are not a BHMs which is a homeopath or an ayurveda doctor they are best at what they are taught they can't be prescribing English medicine because that's not the training they go through simple they're equally fabulous doctors in their stream not in an other stream it's like would you want to come to me for Homeopathy obviously that's that's a nice way to put it that's all so it's like you specialized in as much as I'm an ayurveda Enthusiast and I'm a South Indian grown up my grandfather was an ayurveda Pandit I can't prescribe Aura that's not what I'm trained with so you end up doing either an mbbs I would recruit or then I would recruit a dermatologist now so if you're an mbbs you could do all this then you need to go to a dermatologist if you're having serious issues certain pigmentation hair loss acne these are all things which you need a though it sounds aesthetic you need a specialized dermatologist means looking beautiful correct so it could be anyone from a beautician is an aesthetician M uh Spa therapist is an aesthetician technicians in your office is aesthetic technicians so these are all people who are ancillary services in Aesthetics whose main goal is to get you the outcome of looking your best has time changed now wherein more and more people are are are taking care of themselves from an aesthetic point of view yeah as compared to maybe a clinical issue yeah so it or does that Define you as a doctor like I'm going to do clinical practice or I'm going to do aesthetic practice a lot of people ended up thinking initially I'm a clinical dermatologist and L sometimes even look down upon aesthetic dermatologists but to me today everybody has understood aesthetic Dermatology is nothing but an extension of a clinical Dermatology for example how I look at my patients differently and why I have a certain practice and certain kind of patients who come to me who are much more aware and enlightened about skincare is because if you come to me with a pigmentation I am not just looking at your pigment we are looking at the health of the skin the cause of the pigment it could be anything for example if you come with a patch on the skin it is not necessarily every time that it is melasma which is the most commonly understood thing right so it's not necessarily melasma it sometimes could be a initiation of a horis Nei a small little thing it could be um acanthosis on the face it could be frictional melanosis on the face it could be lpp on the face variant and ashid dermatosis on the face it could be any of this so when you go to a dermatologist they are able to firstly diagnose what is the pigmentation H what is the origin of it iology of it which layer is the pigment there which condition is in both the layers which is in one layer all of this accordingly the treatment can be chosen otherwise you may have a popular laser but you may just be firing in the wrong energies and the wrong wrong place so this is why it's important to go to a legitimate dermatologist and a person who is like Mo the other day someone ended up saying that yeah every dermatologist can be a hair transplant surgeon mhm but you can't necessarily claim so which means to say that if you want to do a hair transplant surgery a dermatologist is qualified to do that but none of us or most of us don't have the training in our College days or in your postgraduation days you have to go and super specialize in that exactly there's no super specialization degree but you have to go and work under someone train under someone for years to be a specialist hair transplant person MH so then you go to them for that likewise maybe for a Botox a filler for anti-aging for equipment devices some of us had that interest and specialized in it right from the beginning so all dermatologists may not be that great in doing anti-aging treatments I take pride in doing that because I've always loved it speaking of anti-aging my antennas went up the moment you use the word Botox okay and um all of us want to look younger yeah even as men today want to look younger why not what is a difference between Botox and filler my God I thought this question has been understood but I see people asking even now this question most people haven't understood it so simple I don't know the difference I do yeah so it's simple so basically I know Botox is some enzyme or some poison you put in and the musle muscles Freeze from the B for no this is this is my Mone initiated okay so what is a Botox and so Botox basically just put simply Botox is a powder that we turn it into liquid from a little bottle pull it out and inject into you filler is more like a transparent jelly which we pull it out and inject into you simple now what does Botox do it let's say for a simple man's term it eases your expression lines which means to say if I have a line when I frown I use a Botox if I have these lines when I raise my brow up I use a Botox you smile and I have cross feet I use a Botox while if I have a line here which is sitting there etched right it is not because I'm moving it is sitting there so that I will fill in with a filler so filler is an inert substance like a clay which I'm putting in and it is sitting there if I want a cheekbone I'm putting in it is sitting there if I want to put give a cheekbone then I end up putting a little bit there mm if I want to put in a chin lip I'm putting in a filler basically anywhere where I want to mold is where I use a filler filler okay now how do they act filler like I said is simply inert goes in and sits where I put therefore I I I always say filler is a job of an artist you master the science you get your Anatomy right you know your product right how then you put these two together to create a beautiful face yeah to create a beautiful face is in the hand of the artist not the tool you may have picked the right tool then what do you do with the tool is why you need to go really do your research when you do the aesthetic treatments because the outcome is not mathematics can't be taught okay it can't be taught from a from a teacher to a pupil at all it's not painting by the numbers can be taught so there those are the basics but it's not the same template that you can put on everybody's face no you don't want to create masks so you are creating in bringing out the best correcting those little flaws enhancing the best features in the person that you're treating so therefore that's a huge art while a Botox can be equated to let's say painting by the numbers because if I decide what is a bulk of my muscle what is the extent of my muscle if I know where is the inter digitation with another muscle and I can calculate and say this many units these points and I'm done so if you know the anatomy really really well and you're able to mark it on the surface really really well then Botox is a simple thing how does Botox act when I inject that into it so the muscle sends a signal and when it says I'm angry you frown MH correct so the muscle said you're angry the muscle does not end up telling anything there's a nerve that's conducting now nerve comes and releases atile Coline atile Coline has a receptor in the muscle that is what muscle responds to and contracts so that's why you frown now if I negate the atile Coline from react responding the the receptor from responding to the atile Coline it won't respond I can keep saying I'm angry but this will say I'm happy I'm calm so that is why Botox is also looked upon as an anti-depressant do you know that yeah it makes makes sense there there's a scientific paper which says yes because you look into the mirror every morning and you're not drowning you're looking happy so mind says Ah I'm happy and it's like a feedback so that is why Botox is an antidepressent so basically it nullifies the signaling liquid from the nerve to the muscle so therefore the muscle action doesn't happen and the FR line doesn't form that is basic difference but there's a lot more we can do with botox where in we can narrow slim the face down slim the nostril down pick the tip of the nose up all these is very experienced injection techniques so there's so much more can be done but this is a basic difference so while a Botox wears off in in 3 months oh btox actually wears off yeah yeah yeah Oh I thought it was a permanent procedure not at all not at all how would I then have my patients keep coming back to me so every 3 months you need to do the retouch up but while a filler goes in and stays textbook wise 6 months to a year but we have now seen in our own experiences that it stays for a long time so that one is a boon and a bane if it stays for a long time and it's a great job on the face you enjoy it for a long time if it's a bad job then you're also living with it for a long time so are there any risk to these fillers of oh yeah oh yeah and I think I think the risk would come in from going to the wrong person also so if you go to a completely unqualified untrained person major things can go wrong imagine you're actually doing things blind it's not like a surgeon you're opening up and doing right so I don't have a vision of oh this is the artery this is the nerve let me avoid this let me do this and let me cut here and let me cut here I'm doing it on a face with the envelope intact mhm so I'm going through it so I need to know my anatomy like the back of my hand I need to do multiple CER dissections which I keep even now indulging in to make sure my anatomy is refreshed and as we are growing older there are so many more newer papers coming up in anatomy where more dissections are done in the face with a different lens now right because they're viewing the anatomist also are viewing the face not just with a simple lens but saying oh my God these are the newer procedures that the doctors are doing so let me look at it more closely look at it more differently so we now know every plane what's happening any deviation in arteries what are the percentage of people with the same artery going in the same place so you need to know your anatomy and the tissue reaction very well if not you could actually go blind you could actually have a tissue dep you could have a entire nose literally falling off so we've had cases such as this around the world not much in India or at least it doesn't come out much but uh there's a lot of very scary things that can happen with filler whatever happens with botox usually recovers because like I said it wears off mhm whatever happens with fillers also mostly recovers because the face is such a wonderful organ there's so much blood supply so kind of recovers but blindness is irreparable I'm just seeing you sitting in your clinic and if somebody walks in you probably able to within about 30 seconds say whether this person has had some treatment or not to their face yeah yeah instantly and they'll sometimes they'll sit and say oh I've done nothing to my face and I will know exactly then I'll I'll put my P pen on paper and say this this this this you've done your fill out they're like no but that was 5 years ago I said but you have done right when I ask you history you should have told me that so I can just see exactly so there are a lot of myths about skin care there are a lot of certified influencers that are there now today on Instagram which come and troll you and me and they think they know it everything they just have a camera and then they have a mic and then they're talking about as if they know the world but they don't have a clinical practice scary what are some of the common myths that are out there or Hocus Pocus stuff that makes your blood boil when you hear about it see today I should say the bloggers also read up a lot so they sound intelligent and they tell you the right things so they may not be much depth if you really to to sound intelligent but you don't have the clinical practice no depth and no clinical no degrees so that's something which you need to be very clear of who you're listening to or who you're who you're even as a completely qualified doctor there are a lot of times people get angry with me because I don't suggest a product but I can't how will I suggest a product online which one is the best sunscreen what kind of a question is that I can't tell you because I don't know your skin type I don't know your sun exposure I don't know where you live Ryan Fernando can you recommend a diet plan yeah hello I don't know your gender I don't know your age I don't know your body fat percentage and then I'm angry you only do it for celebrities you don't do it for me you can't do free for me I'm a poor person and everything so the same same page and then something I would have applied they'll say which one are you applying but that's for my skin so like that what boils me is when people end up coming online is bioindividual very very so one person could use a sunscreen and another person could use a sunscreen and they could have two different effects on the SK yes so even you're like looking at the skin and saying okay you can't use this sunscreen you got to use this sunscreen yeah yeah ah I just thought it was SPF SPF is a general thing there are many factors that you see in a sunscreen SPF is one tell us a little bit about it because you got a lot of sun it's going to it's only going to get hotter heat wave is coming up heat wave is coming up so right from the kids to older people talk to us about skin care routine um you know the free tips to everyone out there who's listening in we got Dr Rashmi in here to me she's this she's the verat kohi of Dermatology so like hitting everything out of the pot let's get some free tips from us what what would you recommend from a skincare routine point of view I remember her hearing ctm yeah cleans when started off in life yeah CM but I'm too lazy to do it so where would you take skincare routine for all of us so like you said the first thing for skin is hygiene I would start right from there so your scalp hygiene is included in skin hygiene so very very important so you need to have a clean a lot of times teenagers come to me with acne and these days teenagers are so paranoid about losing their hair mhm there's also early graying early balding that we see right so they are all oh yeah big time as compared to like 10 years ago this is huge right now so therefore they're scared to wash their hair they think washing hair leads to hair fall which is a big myth not at all keep your scalp clean say that again from me washing hair will not lead to hairall at all in fact accumulation of your dandruff your sebum your dirt on your scalp will lead to inflammation which leads to hair fall that's a sixer right now yeah because everyone's saying today I don't wash my hair don't wash your hair and everything no not the doctor says you got to wash your hair but how do we do it yes so depends on scalp type okay so if you have a very dry scalp how do you know the difference between dry scalp and and dandruff is my NE is your next question so I'm preempting it so if you have a dry scalp you will know that the day you wash your hair mhm immediately once you dry it it starts getting flaky it start getting itchy and a little sensitive um and then if someone kind of opens up your hair and sees the scalp it may feel a little red as well so now this you know is dry scalp flakiness so then you don't wash your hair every day you can wash it alternate day so that some oil accumulate there wait for it to kind of accumulate but if you have an oily scalp then you can wash your scalp every single day with your chosen shampoo now if you do have dandruff then again you need to wash it every single days you're not a letting the yeast and the fat of your skin which is with the skin of the scalp is putting out that's the food for the East so you're going to kill both so you're going to wash it off every day this is what you do now if if you have we only talking about scalp right now so if you have a scalp a certain way and a hair a certain way most people end up asking do my scalp scalp is oily but my hair is dry now what do I do so that's when you wash your scalp with the said shampoo every single day and you don't have to shampoo your hair at all hair is dry hair is not dirty we are all in AC closed environments so you wash your hair just so that you get some hydration and shine on it once in a week with the shampoo but you shampoo your scalp every day and put conditioner for the hair and come out of the bath so this is what you would wash your hair and your scalp separately anti- dander shampoo can only go on the scalp but a hydrating shampoo can go on your hair so that's how you look for hair and scalp shampoo so that is scalp hygiene now skin hygiene depends again on your skin type now whatever is your skin you're having a bath I prefer a liquid soap to a solid soap only because you don't keep pulling applying putting it back and again picking up applying putting it back what's the logic there is it's a soap right and you're touching it on your skin there could be germs there could be dust accumulating do we wash our soap before really using two three people might use the same thing in the house I just feel it is a little unhygienic concept about it though the whole world lives on bra going like yeah I feel uh personally it's it's it's not something that I want to touch tou put back touch put back so it's easy to take it out of a dispenser use it and you're done what is sitting inside is still untouched right true so true and if 10 people in a house use one bathroom for example not all 10 are using the same soap and putting it back so you still I'm the soap dishes sitting sometimes I've seen there'll be a soap dish there'll be a soap with a lot of water in it so nobody is even cleaning and emptying that so I find that whole thing a little unhygienic so it's easier for something coming out of a tube or a dispenser where you know what's inside is clean so that's the bathing ritual with bathing ritual and bathing how many times twice is okay more than that is not good for skin because you're ripping your own oils off I have a lot of athletes and they train like three four times a day wow okay so this has been my advice to them use the soap once a day on the entire body and in your private parts underarms and all all the body folds all the body folds you do that for body order and the that is two B and in thirdd or fourth just use plain water is that okay that's okay maybe if they're athletes you may still want them to use whatever little soaps even at their body folds each time they have a bath because they to sweat it out correct but other than that yeah soap only once okay awesome awesome is there any other skincare routine that we now get into Beyond bathing yeah so I think hygiene wise this is what that you need to be very careful about and washing the face would again be not more than two times if you really have an o oily skin then the third time I've seen a lot of people say oh but I'm just washing with water so this is this is something that I want to I want to share with you because I wrote a book called wheatless right and I had I had pimples my entire life and I as a teenager had this thought process if I washed my face more and I think many of you teenagers out there feel the same that I thought many years ago which is if I wash my face more I will not have more pimples so can you throw some light on this so by and large body works on a feed back mechanism mhm so mostly acne patients that when you say teenage boys have oily skin mhm you're washing the face off every time you feel oily even if you don't use a face wash you still making the skin dry what does the skin do when it is dry it says I'm used to a certain oiliness so skin is too dry let me throw out some more let me throw out some more so you're giving a wrong feedback where it is constantly throwing out more oil mhm so that is not at all happening my multiple times washing the face is only bad for you and if you're using multiple times face wash most acne patients have face wash which is either a salicylic acid based or a benzol peroxide acid based something even if it's a simple tea tree oil based to cut out the oil from the top that is an irritant also so how if the people are doing their own self skin care no so you end up washing your face with your said face wash not more than so sometimes these things actually be harming your skin very skin is a delicate barrier delicate barrier so so don't try and self fix it no not at all not at all and don't try doing anything to it if you don't want to don't keep touching it don't keep doing anything you see a lot of people sitting for an hour they have already touched the face 10 times yeah I have got a lot of kids who come into my nutrition counseling and they're like yeah yeah I'm like don't touch your face and they have already touched one 10 places and come explain the logic why kids when studying when in school should not touch their face one because all hygiene like I keep saying going back to the hygiene rule you would have touched the railing of the steps because you have to skip on the step anden come down and then you touched your book that paper has God knows how many things absorbed and sitting on it how much dust might sitting on it and then your pencil your friend also would have bitten it you would have also bitten it that is also in your hand you would have touched this side that side bench table uniform Kaa everything is dirty your football your throwball everything shoelace all that and kids don't wash their hands in school all the shoelace everything and then you're sitting like this or you're touching your face or you're I am par I don't touch my face only if you see so even as an example I won't do this so you don't touch your face because there is there is so much in your I already did that five times in this podcast and that's why I told you even as an example I don't do this I'm going to fit like this in this podcast hands not on my face yes totally so that's very important for you to make sure that you don't keep touching your face that's a valid point that it's so valid we don't you know we don't teach the youngsters these things simple things simple things don't wash your face on hygiene so much wash your scalp don't wash your face too much don't touch your face at all these are a few things if you do also skin is good Dr Rashmi is it true that the face skin is the most sensitive skin in the human body or like needs that's only because it is exposed Like You cover everything up what is the most exposed all the time is this much no correct even if you cover the neck this much though is always Expos so the sun wind pollution what you apply cream lotion everything is done to this much hand is only touching this much so it's the most sensitive area of your face more sensitized rather than sensitive so now that we know cleansing and cleaning and not to touch our face how do we protect ourselves so protection of course the minute you say protection people say SPF right because we are only thinking we protecting from the Sun there's so much more to protect from but let's start from SPF so when you pick up sun protection is very important in the sunny hours whether you are indoor whether you're outdoor whether there's a cloud cover you need sun protection if the Sun is up and giving you light if there is day you need sunscreen so that's number one now how do you choose the sunscreen right you need to look at a number called SPF which is sun protection factor which means one SPF will give me 10 minutes of safety in the sun Under the Sun so if it is 50 SPF ideally I will get 50 into 10 500 minutes of safety mhm now do I really get that maybe not because to get that there is a certain quantity of sunscreen that we need to apply which most of us don't so every third fourth hour you can reapply the sunscreen if you're really out in the sun if you're in the shade maybe not that many times again and again so that is number one which is SPF second Factor you see on the sunscreen is TPA which is tan protection index M which is usually triple plus 4 plus 1 plus 4 plus is the highest so you see what is the tan protection that protects you from tan the other indication that you can see is IR protection which is infrared protection that is what causes this hot sensation when you're under the sun the infrared spectrum of the Sun Sun Ray is what gives you that heat so if you have issues like redness of the skin already irritated skin skin which is lighter than the rest of them your burning becomes so much more so you need to look at the IR if you have acne any inflammatory disorders make sure it is IR positive your skin care your sunscreen so this is your sunscreen now there are different types there is gel based sunscreen there is Fusion technology which is more like a like a liquid like a milk which flows there's transparent sunscreens these are million type of sunscreens which are available depending on whether your skin is oily whether it is not oily you choose a few Brands and you take you know what's going through my head right no sunscreen is like an umbrella for your skin yeah yes it's like assistant is holding an umbrella for you y yep wow so that is that and then you can also end up choosing the form of sunscreen you want do you want like a creamy application format do you want a powder format do you want a stick format which is so much easier do you want an aerosol format which is even more easier now aerosol not happening there are certain chemicals which makes it aerosol which could be eventually harmful for your General Health so I don't usually say aerosols or sunscreen sprays for children um stick is very easy for children because they'll be running around you can just catch them and you can just do the stick and make them run away okay uh powder is nice on an oily skin because it also acts as an absorbent M um Emulsion is nice for a dry skin or anybody else who doesn't like too much of a cakey feeling silicon based ones are nice for people who want just a matte effect but don't mind applying things so so this is a very large view of sunscreen now above 50 SPF is useless because Beyond 50 to 100 you'll only get a protection of some 02 or 03 per extra even if it was 100 SPF so after 50 if they're writing something it's mostly just a marketing to reapply it's it is you should reapply that doesn't mean 100 means 100 into 10 50 is the best after that is just a marketing thing that people end up putting more number you mentioned that you I was my mind I'm thinking okay I'm going to apply again I got to I've applied it once do I need to wash my face and then apply it the second time yeah because I was thinking like layer upon layer of something you like a lot of times I end up telling my patients that in if you're going on a sunny holiday like a beach holiday don't put a moisturizer and sunscreen firstly because if it's sticky then you won't apply enough sunscreen I want you to apply liberal sunscreen so don't put moisturizer at all today sunscreen has hydronic acid yo cing agent things in it so choose the right sunscreen and apply you can even do sunscreen so you apply an Emulsion sunscreen which has all these extra skin friendly ingredients plus you apply either the powder or the stick or the silicone whichever you like and your skin likes on top of it so you're double layering it so that's called double sunscreen so that is something that you can end up using which might be extra protection for you but if you want to reapply then you can reapply either a powder or a stick depending on your skin care then you don't have to wash off but if you have sweat and dirt and Grime on your face then it's best to wash off and then reapply anything so we have completed cleansing then protection now is nourishment yeah what's your take on nourishment simple moisturizer so it could simply be that if your skin is for example mature and you need more then you can look at ceramides you can look at peptides you can look at all of this to nourish it even further or if you're looking at simply my skin is feeling very dehydrated then you look at more High honic acid what gives you that water so you look at the necessary ingredients in your nourishment nourishment is mostly like quenching the skin feeding the skin certain vitamins like C B5 B3 naside all this can go in you know doctor I'm smiling because once I went shopping with my wife and I was in this beauty store and I was looking at a shampoo bottle is nanite collagen arine B1 B2 I was like I can drink this sh bottle so nourishment even happens externally is there a way that skin scientists uh when they do the research they're able to see the nourishment on the skin Matrix do you look at as a hydrometer or something to check there are there are there are a lot of things there are hydrometers that you can you know see how you reading these studies and then saying okay I want to give my patient ceramide I want to give my patient depti no you know reading each patient becomes honestly difficult there are lot lot of cameras now um I can't even remember the name there are so many that you can put your face in and they will tell you where is the pigment where is the UI damage where is this where is that all of that but honestly with a naked eye yeah these are all more and more fanciness to kind of make it all look oh my God all this is happening but a lot of times you can look at them and you can say like for example if you want to see a genetic Gene for diabetes you don't need to necessarily do a gene testing you can ask the blood test simple or you can say family history blood test also don't want family history look at him he's obese Central girth is high BMR is different then you say oh I'm predicting you're going to be diabetic in some time his eating pattern that you can make clinical as simple as that is or as complex as you want to when your nourishment start when should nourishment start again the day you're born the oiling that is done to you is nourishment to the skin I've seen most families after the baby the kid is five six years of age then there is no skincare routine I keep shouting my son I can go put moisturizer I can go put moisturizer you're going to suffer like Papa with with bad skin and you can't rejuvenate it in your 40s and 50s true so teenagers how important is it for them to nourish because where I'm going with this doct is we'll come back later which is how people eat today yeah but I want people to also understand is that skin care routine is so important so for teenagers the nourishment routine what would you advise so you're so right you know when the kid is born till it is under our control we putting oil whatever whatever whatever after what when it is out of our control and says do not touch me then the Skin Care is gone for a toss till they start Instagram and they start looking at various other people looking saying now I want and then they go and do all s of wrong things at after around 13 14 depending on which family gives Instagram at what time so that inrim which is actually the very crucial period because everybody's also going through hormone changes M maximum sun exposure happens then correct dust wind happens then you're expanding in your body so there's growth of everything happening then your nutrition is formed in your head as your pattern your pallet is being formed so it's very important that everything is affecting you the hormone the nutrition your growth spurt itself your exposure to everything so therefore at that time skin care inculcated into a person like brushing your teeth is very very important mhm hygiene like I say small Skin Care at that moment could be hygiene make sure your scalp is clean make sure the kid is actually having a head wash at least alternate days making sure kid is changing their bed sheets pillow cases in a where is washed a particular way changed a particular way moisturizing the body maybe not a long hot shower these are small small hot shower right that destroys teenage skin correct completely I know so many teenagers and parents complain to me that they are in the bathroom forever and when they come out the bathrooms like a sa yeah you know so okay so everyone out there Dr Rashmi skin expert dermatologist the guru of skin is saying youngsters don't have hot showers for too long tepid water room temperature water and speaking of temperature water uh I see sometimes people talking about ice bowl and putting your face into tighten your pole what's your opinion on that it just it's like a again shock to the skin right so we don't want to be shocking the skin actually um if you shock there are certain protective mechanism which actually comes alive in you so it's okay to shock but please beware I myself did a real once said that you know with easier way we all don't have you know ice buckets to dip in after the um workout so you finish workout come in have a hot water shower and immediately turn the thing to cold and that time it was Jan I think or December when I did this real you got a catch no I'll tell you what happened then I did a ice cold immediately and I said have a shower and that that's done your body you go through right so that's your shock and you've got what you have to from the ice and you're done then I got a DM from a from one of my followers saying dog I think you should put a disclaimer in this reel because I did this once much before and um I ended up fainting passing out there so that shock can be that extent of Vaso constriction that if you are a low blood pressure patient you can just all in the shower so please when you listen to things understand these things that we give out on 3 seconds because you all don't have patience to listen to Long format now thankfully to all of you podcast has become a thing that people want to listen otherwise oh no attention span 30 second talk finish in 30 seconds finish in 30 seconds you're like how do I give everything in 30 seconds you say something so it's fully out of context it's not generalized then you end up doing it and things may go wrong so my whole point is I believe in shock I believe even icing but has to be done by the right people right context after the physician has looked at you and said you're generally a healthy person and can take that shock other you fall into your ice tub something else might happen so speaking of correcting what people should not be doing the fourth pillar comes in right which is correction and skin talk to us about correction correction for me is when you have a problem you have an acne you go to your Dermatology she'll give you a correction that is your correction you have pigmentation you've gone to your doctor she's given you most I like doing correction at night nourishing at night morning just protection makes sense yeah makes real sense the face is the soul to the world right and you are what you eat very much so I wanted to bring you in as the guru of the skin which is how important is nutrition to you everything to me skin is just literally like a diagnostic tool for what's happening inside for example if there's anemia skin is pale if there's excess sugar skin looks dark if there is uh let's say vitamin uh upheaval certain vitamins make you look very cracked and very dark and protein goes down you can actually see brittle hair brittle nails so everything is about what you have put into you is what is seen outside there is these zero fat diets people do instantly you end up looking at the skin getting looking very very aged and crinkled and dry so literally what you put in how how good is your core is how the skin glows so skin hair and nail are but simply byproducts of well-being okay so having said that Ryan I want to ask you how do you end up you know I've seen a lot of dietitians who eliminate no uh sugar at all or no uh fruit at all or let's say no oil at all which is more sinful what is your take on Elimination Diet or are you all inclusive but in a limit for me over the years of practice I've seen bio individuality works and no one size fits all true so there are people who you know when you turn the skin from outside and put it inside it becomes your gut yeah and they have very resilient skin inside the gut is really strong so the Elimination Diet actually cures up certain of their issues and then they can get back to eating normally but then there are some of us who are got very sensitive guts or sensitive skin I believe that when you put food inside and it sits inside your stomach your skin sometimes can show what you have done of course of course and so from that perspective um I do the blood test I do the nutrigenomics in the nutrigenomics I'm very fond to look at the caffeine sensitivity the lactose sensitivity and the gluten sensitivity now if a person tries to say that no but you know I've eaten wheat my entire life and there's no problem then I do a food intolerance blood test so if I get enough of signals coming to me saying that hey this is not working then I try and begin to counsel the client saying that hey let's try 3 to six weeks on a nutrition plan and let's see if there's any Improvement now within the first 3 to 5 days is the the gut feeling is there and within 10 to 15 days 90 out of 100 clients will say my skin has cleared up of course so from that perspective um a lot of people um one of the side effects of a great diet I won't call it a side effect I'll say a good effect a good effect of falling a a bio individualized diet is that your skin begins to Glow yeah so true so I to keep telling my patients to end up doing like a food Dairy I tell them just start writing down everything do a journaling of food so you yourself can understand the day you're feeling Burpy bloated and you will see very next few days maybe there's an acne which will erupt out so you know what to eliminate that way so as a dermatologist and a skin Guru in my department of nutrition are there any supplements or Botanicals that over your years of experience you kind of use them as your best friends yeah lot of them in fact I believe in micronutrition replugging because there's one macron nutrition of course which experts such as you really take care and understand what cab which cab how much Cab For example what protein which protein how much protein all of this is and the oils all of this is taken care of then as much as we may eat right we may eat healthy the produce itself is not like before right there's not enough nutrition in the produce itself so you need that little micro plugging of nutrition to happen so that's when I believe in supplementation and in supplementation I've realized that I not only look at English medicines or not medicines let's say vitamins and minerals and amino acids Etc but I also like for example milk thisle it's a fabulous anti-inflammatory and it just comes from English intelligence like curcumin comes from intelligence so like that I like to mix these little things shatavari for example comes from our ayurvedic intelligence so I like to mix the English and the other traditional and plug them together towards a goal either it is an antioxidant or an anti-inflammatory or it is let's say something which calms down the hormonal upheaval just before a menstrual cycle so these are things that I like to put together and I believe in them as micronutrients to support the functioning of the body when people walk into your clinic I'm I'm just thinking if I was a fly on the wall how much of you look of you looking at them you would say that is it because they're eating too much and therefore they have bad skin yeah every every single person in my clinic I ask them about their diet it is very important for me everybody so we ask them about their diet and I just tell them I'll send you an elimination list and an inclusion list I'm not a dietetics expert so I can't give you a diet chart and what to do nor will I be able to monitor you because I don't have that kind of time and bandwidth to that subject so then I tell them either you can go to your nutritionist and show them this elimination list and double check with them we also have a nutritional supplement list that I will give them to support so that to me is very important a starter point so this comes under the nourishment part of one of your pillars yeah can any of the nutritional products help in the correction part yeah yes a lot of them simply for example a vitamin D yeah so a lot of them come with very fulminant or very infective acne which is looking red and angry then I do ask them let's say for example for their hormonal issues which I ask clinically is their breast tenderness do you have headache do you have mood swings do you have flushing on your face then if all of this for example they say yes then I already know clinically the prolactin may be high mhm then we end up looking at their hormone testing to see if prolactin is high I won't simply go and give a drug to bring the prolactin down but I will also check their vitamin D because I know the minute I correct the vitamin D prolactin will automatically start coming down a little or if they are on Ant acids then I know that can also increase the prolactin levels so I'll tell them to cut that so the nutrition and what you put into your gut becomes so important the way the hormones behave there are lot of pro- estrogen nutrition uh elements such as let's say um flax seeds uh soy all of these are very Pro estrogenic right so if you're already high on estrogen if you're already getting a lot of let's say oily skin acne prone skin I am not going to load you more with that so these are a few things that I work with and balance it out what is Dr rashmi's nutrition uh shedule like so you have beautiful skin so I'm I'm so you're like doing stuff on yourself and doing the pillars of cleansing um what was the second one uh protection protction nourishment and correction when necessary so from a from a nutrition point of view what does your day look like so I think I'm pretty much a South Indian mhm yeah and I stayed you won't believe between 50 and 53 kgs all my life all my life from being a teenager to now um only last two months I've put on after the podcast I'm going to ask you tips free tips so put on some 2 to three kgs but what I have always lived with is three meals a day so I have my breakfast my lunch and my dinner and it is always I know intermittent fasting is become a style now or a theory that most people are talking about but that's how I led life my mom always served dinner by around 6:37 so even today I have my dinner by 6:37 and you continue practice after that uh no I finish practice by 7:00 okay so sometimes it's 7:30 so it goes a little delay otherwise that's that's how I practice so I have my breakfast at 9:00 lunch sometimes because of practice gets up and down but I'd like to have it at 2:00 then I have my dinner at 7:00 and I'm done I don't snack in between if I feel very hungry by around 12ish if I know my lunch is getting delayed I have half a Peru which I remove the seed but I don't remove the skin so I just have half a perro or one orange or one uh citrus fruit that's all is what my diet is what I've learned and observed why I have a constant weight and my skin also is good and nourished I take one size of let's say this much now this is my salad this is my soup this is my vegetable this is my chicken fish whatever and this is my rice okay so what I do is very unconsciously I've seen over the years my carb is not very big carb is equal to my vegetable equal to my protein which could could be either a black Dal Gussy or something like that or it is the chicken or the fish of the day so just that much if there is a salad or a soup it is just that much so I'm not binging on a carb as a natural thing but I don't eliminate carb because I know you should tell us please tell us about not eliminating carbs and I want to ask you more so that's been what I atat and a few of my supplements that I like can change according to the season and my age what are the supplements that you take so I make sure Primrose is something that I like so even evening R evening primrose with the flax seed with uh with a vitamin E now that as a combination works best for you in terms of all the omegas that you need but take advice take advice from your personal Dermatology doctor or a qualified dietitian when you take a nutritional supplement a lot of people do self prescription so this is your prescription to yourself like for example I see everyone taking glutathion vitamin C effervescent tablet in effervescent there's so much soda by cup which you don't need actually killing you're destroying the glutathion but that's another story exactly you're destroying the glutathion to you're changing the pH of the entire gut why would you do that you should tell us more about that or you take gummies because everybody is saying so there's so much cellulose and sugar in it you just don't need it so yeah self-medication not happening about nutrition the right format is important there's so much science behind it so I take bright which is a set of um antioxidants with of course the popular glutathion in it and many more then I take a hydrate which has col collagen in a tablet form so I don't have to mask the smell and the taste of collagen in a liquid form or a powder form so it's more in a tablet form with edible hyaluronic acid with luttin all of that to hydrate so I take something to hold the water I take something which is the Omega oils which I told you to hold the oil and I take something which is an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory so these are something I'm quite regular with and um I definitely see the difference that those micronutrient plugging will do to you as you grow and if you are to choose five of your favorite foods rice rice rice from a skin perspective skin perspective you know I also say from a skin perspective there's something called as a gut skin axis scientifically there's so much more towards the microbiome the absorption all of that but for me gut skin axis only means eat the food that quenches your soul MH for me it's curd rice and the day I eat something which quench is my soul my fish curry and rice this makes me happy and when you are happy there's so many more happy hormones releases stress reduces skin automatically looks good so one is the whole nutrition perspective which is Elemental knowledge and science the physiological part and then the psychological part psychological happy part so I'm like take something which sooths your gut sooths your memory sooths your mind so you're like very happy with it so that glows on the skin so doc H you're stuck on an island yes and you can take only five foods with you and none of your medical equipment or your clinic your skin therapist nobody's there with you what are the five foods you'd carry with you to that Island water mhm rice mhm remember your skin huh then um can I can I take veggies and grow yeah you can take veggies and grow so I'll take some veggies and then sew there and then start growing them some veggies okay lots of veggies the fish is there in the island yes so that's my Omega C there H so I'll catch the fish that's how good is omega3 for the skin very good okay very good so my fish is come last one you can't take sweet no I won't take sweet sweet why won't you take sweet that's because it's going to kill everything that is going to firstly my perspective of now I want to stay youthful on my skin right it's going to make my collagen brittle and it's going to break the collagen and kill it make the elastin brittle so I don't want it it speeds the end glycation of anything so the protein becomes brittle I don't want sweet for multiple reasons if I'm if I'm eating sweet increase the glucose and therefore inclusing insulin is that why our grandmothers were much younger than the current generation in terms of their skin and their looks because they didn't have that much access to Sugar I think our grandmothers were younger because they also didn't kill themselves to stay lean there was lot more subcutaneous fat which is very important it is not just a source of nice coating under the skin it is also that coating holds back even the Skin's collagen really well holds a little bit of estrogen there for a longer time there's a peripheral conversion and estrogen there so that is why they looked a lot younger and they were less stressed there was less pollution less Sun so there was multiple Factor true true wise words yeah you know you talked about glycation so this is basically in my opinion sugar going and slapping correct so we have HB A1C correct is that the same process liation of hemoglobin yeah that is a cumulative 3mon analysis of how your body is behaving with sugar correct so basically the sugar is slapping hemoglobin and you can see that 3mon period dis glycation happen for your skin yeah so glycation is nothing but hardening of the protein there so that makes it makes the skin c h that's why you're saying don't have sugar huh and also what happens is um when you have sugar that Spike of sugar gives you a spike of insulin every time you spike sugar insulin keeps spiking K insulin sits there because it's spiked out so much and the body doesn't even work with insulin the way it should work so doc what you're tell it's insulin resistance doc what you're telling me is I mean when we say sugar people think only table sugar no but our insulin Spike goes up with the carbohydrates that come from our food and so if you're eating too much you have these constant spikes of insulin which is actually aging you yeah so would fasting also making you darker also making your skin thicker not the good thickness of skin that you want with collagen but bad thickness of elastosis kind of hard thickness that you don't like so skin simply goes bad with sugar also there's insulin like growth factors that it stimulates so acne increases so sugar is a bad story so I get a lot of teenagers so like they're like they buy all of these products and they do the skin care but they're forgetting their diet very important and when I say sugar like you rightly said they only think tablespoon of sugar they'll simply be having an ice cream they'll have a cookie which is sugar and dairy and mea which is processed food which is which is lethal that combination is lethal so a cookie a cake an ice cream a processed cheese a processed meat all these are lethal because they have all the three So when you say lethal I got a lot of teenage girls who are overweight skin is bad yeah pcod is a new condition for the last decade polycystic ovarian disorder do you see a lot of pcod cases and what are the Skin Care issues associated with this condition so PCOS is literally a lifestyle disease is what I call it starts off by wrong eating by stress these are two things which if I can narrow Odon are the triggers for this does it happen with these teenage girls when they're finding their identity early teen years mom don't correct me on eating I want to eat whatever I want I'm stressed out you think that could be a starting point yeah stress and eating are the two starting points that's your lifestyle which the mother intervene at that point yeah so when I have PCOS patients coming in I have the mother the father and when the girl is sitting I tell them you can't tell the child not to eat XYZ I can't tell the child you better get lose that weight that you've gained when both of you are this on the weighing scale so parents family parents need to lead by exactly you have to be a family together to help the child to look a certain way be a certain way it's not about looks it's about health so you have to end up having what the family eats is what shows on the kids and you all together so it has to be a food Habit in C if you as parents are going out every day partying and eating and a teenage child to sit down and eat gka it's not going to happen and at home if you have this much cooking and that much happening it is it has to be a discipline that's in the family so that's important now cut the question of PC in my practice it's a big chunk of practice these days because they present one with acne two because there's insulin resistance also Associated PCOS there's lot of skin pigmentation especially on the neck on the forehead on the temples on the cheeks that can happen you could end up having excessive hair growth on the face so very maleik terminal hair yeah heroism is what can happen on the face you have hair fall from the scalp all of this is part of PCOS sometimes their periods might be very regular so today also when I saw the results and I told a patient oh you're marginally pcis we'll have to do this she said but my periods are regular periods can still be regular you can still have PS you needn't be obese or overweight you can still be p P which is a lean PCOS we call it so it could be either a source from the ovary which is kind of driving it wrong or it could be adrenals which is driving it wrong so we do some blood test to figure out what is driving your PCOS and treat it accordingly very important for us to also correct the nutrition a doctor said correct your nutrition for pcod condition and parents you need to lead by example now speaking about uh you know parents I remember when I went to study uh my mom told me don't drink tap water when I went to Scotland now when I went to Scotland you know that in Europe water can be drunk from the T but some of this Indian mentality mindsets we still you can't take it so then I found out that bottle water was really expensive and uh orange juice was really cheap so I ended up drinking orange juice for insulin Spike and how yeah I ended up drinking orange juice for nearly four to five months and then suddenly my nails started going yellow oh and I got scared and I went to the doctor at the NHS and he says he he did all the questions the doctors asked he just said are you drinking too much of orange juice so I think there was this case of pigment of people having uh too much of nutrition so as a doctor have you seen cases where eating too much of carrots or orange juice or for that matter any food in your career like you can look at a person like what do you orange fellow so are the things that you can tell people out there that which is yeah like oh I know you're doing this nut and you have a skin problem or your skin is orange in color so share with us some of the secrets that you get out of I think the only thing I say is everything even the probably nectar is good in a limit you over drink it God knows what happens MH so you need to be in limit everything like you would say as a nutrition carb is good in a limit you can't eliminate this is good in a limit so likewise for me everything is good in the limit so especially vitamin tablets that you keep popping be very careful so there are to simplify it there's a set of vitamins let's say a d e k which is fat soluble vitamins you end up having them without the doctor's prescription you're going to end up with toxicosis so likewise a lot of food substance in excess but honestly right now I don't see much of people in food binging which becomes excess except glucose insulin okay which are the foods that a teen teager or anybody who has oily skin that they should avoid what do you tell them I usually generally tell them fried food not because fry exactly oil comes out on the skin because fried food is highly inflammatory especially if it is refried with oils which are already so all the street food that we get today is really bad and somebody the other day told me you will know the answer that there is a way a certain oil that they use which is apparently the cheap oil the palm oil yeah where you can't say which oil it is or the flavor you don't get so we did the costing of oils okay and so if you and I look look at pure ghee it's in excess of 700 rupees a kg okay whereas the other oils will come down the the range and palm oil comes in at the cheapest so if you and I opened up a restaurant and imagine cooking a food and G how expensive the dish would be so you're looking at the profitability of the restaurant yeah so restaurants are not looking at the nutritional element of foods they're looking at the financial element or the profitability return so the palm oil is something that I think the fried fruit on the streets is what is is slapping us but that's the inflammatory markup is there any other foods that you sugars we said already yeah so what are the foods that needs to be avoided if you have an acne prone oily skin one of course is anything that is fried and fried in the wrong oil two you could also stop anything which spikes your glucose there for your insulin so anything that is sweet to the tongue has to be be avoided not just tablespoon of sugar and third will be inflammatory which means to say whatever makes you feel bloated Burpy you know the next day skin is feeling red and irritated it could be different for different things for one it could be mea for one it could be wheat for one it could be milk so whether it is dairy or mea or gluten I leave it to you to decide if you're so Keen you could go to you and do a food tolerance test and do all of that to figure out which is it you know one way when people don't want to do the test resting I just asked them to check their resting heart rate for 10 days then I tell them you eliminate these Basic kuili Foods yeah and we invariably see a drop in the resting heart rate really by three to five points but that's significant enough to convince my client that there does show a link between the food wow and your inflammatory markers a simple a simple dipstick test that you can do many people do not want to do a food intolerance test many people are in denial that food could be the causative condition so now I want to ask you for PCOS if I can ask you to give me a free diet for all my patients of PCOS so so number one is what I feel is that you know and you laugh at this but I I call the cysts in the ovary as the pimples inside the ovaries yeah right okay now why do we get pimples it's because some food you're eating that is wrong yeah you already told me that don't need too much of sugar uh and um PCOS is insulin resistance so we have this whole Cascade that comes back yeah I have identified it as a logical conjecture that between the ages of 11 and 15 as the girl is growing up she's forming her identity her mensis and hormonal structure starts in so there is the mood fluctuation there is a behavioral change uh she's moving into adult mindset of thinking and therefore I believe that food represents one independent adult choic making decision not when you're 18 but at a much younger age wow H so now what happens is most of the fathers don't interfere and I think a lot of the mothers are also working so the conversations are not at the dinner table or at the lunch table anymore so the girl now is exposed to Media which says I need to have this Slim Trim figure and a lot of girls understand that by starvation you get there I get there and they stop eating so nutrition now suddenly drops and when they do eat they're eating from a craving perspective yeah and when you are stressed out research has already shown people who are stressed will gravitate to high fat and high sugar foods so now we come back into the whole behavioral mechanism when The Limited food choices in a week in a month in a year are bombarding your hormonal system yeah and coupled to the fact that we are so focused on academics in today's day and age for the woman to be contributing she has to lead she has to become powerful um you're focusing so much on academics physical activity is being lost so as a result you're putting on weight and I think by the time three years have gone 13 to 16 10th standard we have got that 5 8 kg fat gain and I think that's where the pcod condition begins to start flaring in and coming in and then we have the insecticides pesticides the pseudo estrogen molecules from Plastics from microwaving so I always tell people don't fry your food because trans fat goes and kues you so no fried food so I see teenagers look at me like not even me French fries I say specifically noten fries right and and so um I spend a lot of time educating the girl child that she needs to walk Walking is one of the best fat burning exercises uh because many girls have anemia and can't do these high-end sporting activities they're out of breath and then they say this is not for me whereas walking is a sustainable to do and then we're looking at elimination of the high glycemic index carbohydrates correct I don't say grainfree but I choose a more intelligent grain which could be based on if the parents give me a permission to do the food intolerance test if they don't what I do is I do a simple thing one week one week eat this grain this grain tell me how's your potty do you have gas does the wing scale go up so a lot of times we find out then people let's say for example eat only maida chapati or wheat chapati or whole wheat or quinoa or brown rice or ragi we begin to able to form a pattern so you're not against MAA anybody like you said no even a poison taken a little form is okay uh I'd like to behave like a judge when MAA comes in front of me I don't say guilty or I Let It Go free I ask what are you appearing before me as a petition so if it's a crossan you're in Paris enjoy it right but if every day we're going to sit in our clinic at 4:00 in the evening or we're in school pool coming out of the canteen and ordering those Cakes and Pastries or I'm having I have the choice to ask for a healthier rooty and I don't have the knowledge because the maida releases a sugar Spike immediately because of the refined flow and my my saliva mixes with and gives me this the pleasure sensation so then I'm like dude I got to educate you and therefore once you get educated you will realize that MAA without its fiber is going to be bad for you because it's a nuclear bomb getting into you yeah so when you put all of this together I think the pcod diet is driven more from behavioral consequences and lack of information on what to eat and how much to eat with the younger girls they're eating too little and with the girls who have now gone into college or their first job in college they're like kahang now my body is this way I can't do anything about it so there's this uh I don't care whatever attitude and they don't realize that um they could control it with the proper nutrition and then comes the uh I can't exercise either I don't have the schedule time it's not a belief in my family or I'm too body conscious to go out and work out because I'm getting trolled or shamed on the internet because I'm of a heavier weight so I sit in a counseling room and I hear all of this people break down and it's not about the diet it's it's about just that the Stig stigma associated with eating too much eating unscientifically or eating not at all and then when they get into this I work in my first job I've got a prove that I'm a girl I'm a woman in this workplace so I will work longer hours than anybody else let my food go for a toss and then I'm living in pgs I'm gone to this big city I'm no longer eating mamaka ka ka so the tiffen box is coming in so she's working really hard now she's stressed stress stressed she's trying to prove herself out and Doc you know better than anybody else as a doctor how stress affects your hormones so now you got another 3 4 cages of weight gain so what do we do now we have nutritional deficiencies we have the stresses so I'm drinking copious amounts of tea and coffee and suddenly because my brain needs that spot of energy I had two three teaspoons of sugar and so now the pcod rears itself even more and then we get another 3 4 kgs 5 kgs 10 kgs weight gain before you know this teenage girl who was of the right BMI is suddenly 20 kgs heavier and then she comes to marriageable age because she's going to get married and she wants to look good in that wedding gagra or gown stop she calls up Brian Fernando can I can I lose weight in 3 months and something that has taken almost 3 to 10 years cannot be lost in in in 3 months so at that point you know you you look at this symptoms the skin little bit of hair or you just guess intelligently by looking at the homas score or the insulin resistance and the high average blood sugar levels they're like I think you should go and see a dermatologist you should go and see a gynecologist these two doctors you have to be because you're going to be getting married so you want beautiful skin and you want to know that all your female reproductive system is in the right place and then suddenly they get this thing about pcod like hitting them so that's another place we diagnose it and then the last stage is where uh you know trying for kids kids yeah and that's where it's not detected till now which is the skinny PC in fact when I married my wife um we we had a we had a late marriage both of us and my mother-in-law is a gynecologist and the moment we got married the first thing my mom mom-in-law said to me he like don't delay you have to have make babies immediately and I was like we just got married to each other and stuff like that and um my wife says I have pcod and I knew the condition and everything I says don't worry about it and um I remember my mother-in-law saying is you start fertility treatment right now itself I was like no we want do it let's get into diet so my personal experience is that pcod is a reversible condition completely and nutrition is tantamount because you can take all the hormones medication do all the high-end weight training and exercise and run marathons but if you want that ovary to reset itself get rid of those SP as I call it you got to go with nutrition so true so true Dr Rashmi you are the skin goddess the guru the teacher the doctor my God I am the nutritionist yes your domain is skin care my domain is nutrition care I will choose five things that everybody out there needs to do for better skin wow what are the five things that you say are the top priority for them to do for their skin so you go first so the five points for skin which is super important one of course the first one is skin care which is the four pillars that we discussed earlier so start with a good skincare better you go to a dermatologist understand your skin and start that most important number two visit Ryan understand what is nutrition because like we said before what you put in is what shows on the skin very important people think that you go to a nutrition only when you're either obese or you want to put on weight either want to lose or put on weight for me just go to a nutrition in general to understand what you should eat understand the healthy food so that's one thing third very important thing is mobility so exercise whichever is yours whether if it is sports if you're a young kid you don't have to do an walking and running and gyming you do Sports Mobility see how you expend the energy that you're putting in um fourth is a lot of hydration to the skin so again excessive water drinking will only drain out the nutrition so you need to know exactly what is the hydration you're taking in how's your lifestyle and how you consume that um what could the fifth one be I am thinking don't self-medicate is the fifth one I would think actives don't overdo the actives a lot of them are looking at internet don't don't self don't self-prescribe and so many actives you putting in on the skin first because you can't undo some of the damage yeah okay so go there f one that's it so the fifth one is too many actives getting educated online Internet self- education and putting in the actives which might actually lead to long-term damage maybe difficult even for a Derm to then corrected it's not everything cannot be raised yeah you don't paint your house today you don't service your own mobile or your car yourself but uh you know your diet and your skin everyone want every everyone's Everyone's an expert on it and the best part is they come to your clinic and they say they've done our research from where why did I study so many years so now these were my five points what yours my first point is walking ah most of India has a heavier BMI especially Urban India walking is one of the best fat burning exercises on the planet in fact yesterday I found somebody running in the gym and I went up to her and I says ma'am what's your goal and she said I want to lose 5 cges of fat I said walk because when you walk your heart rate is in a Zone wherein your substrate utilization of energy is 70% from fat and 30% from carbohydrate when you run you utilize more of your muscle glycogen which is carbohydrate so the first thing for great skincare and you also agreed with me that people when they run yeah the face get does get affected to a certain extent from an aging point of view now there's two things in a runner's face if you're running and you're running at a certain pace and you're not running every day like a marathon runner and you're of an Optimum weight weight then that'll give you that glow that fresh blood into your face that little flushing and make you feel lovely while it can be the other edge of the sword where you've run so much you're so lean right now and you're at an age where the face can go fully gaunt so that's called as a runner's phase in a not so positive way so you need to be very careful which age how is your skin how is your bony structure when you really decide to run to be that lean which is why I'm going to be now walking like this because I'm going to get fat burning it's going to be good on my skin and I'm not going to get the gaunt look but you see you have a very lovely bony structure of the face so you will never age badly and you have a very lean face I'm sure you being the nutritionist have the exact fat percentage which is right not low I know you may never have high because you're the nutritionist but you won't even have it low so that keeps your skin nice and three your acne has been your blessing the scars because of of the acne is actually holding your skin tight and not kind of letting it go down and scarred tissue has so much collagen elastin and Scar Tissue it just holds the skin there doctor I feel like taking you for an ice cream though I would say I can't give an ice cream but that's what I do let's go get some sugar that's the best news I heard this Century but my second tip of nutrition uh would be hydration yes um and and not only because the skin but 70% of the human body is made up of water the brain has water the kidneys have water skin has water everything has water so I am very focused on people hydrating more responsibly and in today's world everyone wants to not have plain water they want to have something beverages uh if he rewound 1,000 years there were no beverages bages we just drank water so I think that would be my second tip bring water back as a fashionable element into your body third would be as you said you would take to your Island vegetables fruits are my fourth between these two if you're looking for weight loss I'm looking at vegetables being my best friend and fruits is like your side friend okay yeah but if you're looking at weight gain then I would say hey get a little bit more of the fruits as your as your best friend the final point over here is I would and I be I might be trolled a lot for this is I would look at the grain control better g r a i n mhm you see you and I today are DJs what's that Dash jockies okay right so our ancestors moved and walked and worked a lot so their calorie requirement was very high so which element in the food chain gives us higher calories it is the carbohydrates and fat now fat technically comes in the added fat from our vegetable oils and all so I tell people that's a given to reduce but carbohydrates because we brought up by our ancestors our dadis and our our mothers we want to eat more of grein we are taught to eat more of grain India is a culture where we celebrate food as an expression of love so if I can reduce the grain or improve the grain so white rice maybe get brown rice red rice if there is uh U wheat go towards the old kamut wheat or kle wheat uh if you're Gluten Sensitive then go to the gluten-free grains everything from joar bajra ragi Aman but again check your bio individuality like I'm allergic to ragi even though ra even ragi is a great game because when I have ragi I get lose motion so I've got a hyper sensitive gut but there are few things like kinab bakat koutu my stomach likes so my advice to people is begin to understand that your body is the most expensive real estate you keep saying that yeah right and are we living in it as a landlord or as a tenant and to me you are like uh when like you would be like my nutrition architect that I would go to because my house needs to be constructed it's the most
