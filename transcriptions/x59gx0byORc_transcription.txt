Transcript: hey guys if you're not able to watch my long form content of podcast here are some short form clips for you to [Music] enjoy they say that Japan whilst you have the Sumer wrestlers who are very powerful you also have the karate people you have the Samurai warrior uh you have Japan having Health spars you have Japan having a lot of Health screenings why does the Japanese government and the Japanese people and why is it there in Japanese culture that health screening is very important so basically health screening start in the war war time in Japan at that time Japanese government wanted to make all people healthier so at that time like you know it's TV uh tuberculosis spread it so all the time uh to find at early stage to remove or to treat so this was this was a original but after that change the culture one by one for example like after that it's a cancer because age become country become aging so cancer screening is become important and after that so many people become rich and eat more so then like more heart attack and diabetic this kind of happen so that's why like lifestyle screening start so it's a like a long history around 50 around 70 years so lifestyle screening is not only happen happening for your generation it has been happening for your father's generation also uh yeah yes yes yes cancer screening start my father's generation lifestyle Disease start from my generation I'm aged now uh 42 okay so this start around 30 years ago so tell me something uh at what age do the Japanese people go for their first screening test 22 22 m then I join the company then start this is a company overation I'm not able to understand what is that Japanese philosophy in India people wait to fall sick at any age and go to doctor so why is the company screening at 22 this is actually government rule mhm so uh Japanese government uh has a obligation uh everybody employee have to be in health screening mhm so when I joined the company at 22 years old every year I have to go if I don't go company will punish me I have to go but India if you're listening in the company says you should go for screening government insists with the company please screen your employee for their health so this is mostly lifestyle disease scening correct lifesty and cancer screening okay and are there um has this helped Japan have lower segment of the population having diabetes hypertension cancer is there statistical data showing an improvement over over the last three four decades yes it's a drastically for example like my father's age young time my father's young time at that time like many fat people are there but like nowadays it's not not much see fat people if you come to Japan You Don't See Much F people I I have seen that there are no you watch films and documentary I'm looking in the the the station the zebra Crossing uh Tokyo Street five intersection you're like I looking no fat people yeah everybody same style same suit do Japanese do Japanese people go to the gym yes yes uh we go but more than that is a eating habit is controlled and the exercise also controlled okay so you're saying that the screening also at very young age gives you the awareness that oh there is a weight gain there is a blood pressure there is some cholesterol so in your personal health screening was there anything that made you change your lifestyle Behavior yeah for example when I joined the company by 22 years old with every year take screening then definitely some C is there so when I joined the company 68 69 kilo but after the certain time I become gross gross gross and reach to 80 you are 80 k K wa and age at 35 at that time every year doctor alled me you you have to reduce you have to reduce so then uh like he allotted and on the same time my uric acid also grows with with uh you know are you a biology student no I'm a a businessman so so suddenly the awareness is coming oh there is something called uric acid yeah exactly this is I I I didn't know uric acid what is this but told me you are here but now your kilo is weight is here and U acid also followed so now you become 7.5 basically like average is five or six more than seven is dangerous I become seven eight and then doctor said like now you have to take medicine the to reduce like uric acid otherwise your kidney will be damaged in future I and then I asked him how many how long I have to take medicine he said lifetime I said what in the age of 35 I have no problem at all my feeling but he said like lifetime you have to take medicine I said wait wait doctor I don't want but he said no that's why I'm saying to reduce your weight with your reduce weight then your uric acid will go down and your kidney will be protected I said okay doctor but he didn't believe me because heed many time but I didn't take action but after that I take action so from 80 kilo 78 75 now around 72 so then uric acid will go down and doctor said good job keep your M weight at this at this level then you are healthy so that's why I'm like now but before I was bit F actually if I go like that my kidney damage maybe heart attack comes diabetic happen so this is the way Japanese people is control health so is there anything in Japanese culture that your parents or your grandparents talk about when it comes to food yeah we eat uh as much as of course we like but basically our culture said like har okay is saying like stop to eat my stomach feel 80% don't exceed more than 80% 100% 20% uh% then it will be like become fat and become who and become lazy so 80% stop keep maintain Health nicely and when do you learn this ah I don't exactly remember the company or the doctor tells you no in basically in the home yeah my father mother Granda culture yes yes okay yeah to educate for young kids to stop by E 80% so so I think another thing that Japan brings to us is the very large sumo wrestler yes yes so so he that Su wrestler eats more that is like special training
