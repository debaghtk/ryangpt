[0.16 - 8.44] the biggest misconception that people
[3.92 - 11.20] have yoga has to be a 24 by7
[8.44 - 14.20] process I'm drinking this glass of water
[11.20 - 16.56] am I 100% involved with this process
[14.20 - 18.60] that's yoga which is why if you see a
[16.56 - 20.72] lot of
[18.60 - 22.56] yogis especially the ones who are living
[20.72 - 26.00] in the Himalayas they're not falling
[22.56 - 28.52] sick and the reason is that the and yoga
[26.00 - 31.32] is that you are not just functioning
[28.52 - 33.60] here as a piece of creation you can
[31.32 - 35.32] become the Creator himself good
[33.60 - 36.64] astrologer if they know you're a yogi
[35.32 - 38.64] they will never predict you because they
[36.64 - 40.20] know you have taken charge of your own
[38.64 - 42.32] life so those stars and planets don't
[40.20 - 44.08] make a difference in your life so why
[42.32 - 47.28] won't you want to spend those 45 minutes
[44.08 - 50.04] or 1 hour every day in
[47.28 - 52.36] this so all of this cold shower and
[50.04 - 54.84] emptying your bars and urination should
[52.36 - 57.00] be done before you start your practice
[54.84 - 59.56] always when you wake up first thing in
[57.00 - 62.00] the morning I want to be a medium where
[59.56 - 64.12] I can impart this and make a difference
[62.00 - 66.72] in others life because this is the only
[64.12 - 66.72] reality I
[70.84 - 75.60] know touted as one of the youngest and
[73.88 - 78.40] brightest pioneers of Yoga and Wellness
[75.60 - 81.00] in the country formerly a national
[78.40 - 83.96] swimming champion for 14 years schloka

[94.56 - 99.72] to a larger audience across the globe
[97.32 - 101.40] she regularly conducts yoga programs
[99.72 - 103.32] online I'm going to become a student of
[101.40 - 106.36] hers and in person at various
[103.32 - 108.28] destinations across around the world now
[106.36 - 110.20] shoka closely works with various
[108.28 - 112.28] corporate organizations like Ernest and
[110.20 - 114.76] Young Healthcare organization like
[112.28 - 118.04] Fortis and the all- India Institute of
[114.76 - 120.92] Medical sciences and various NOS giving
[118.04 - 123.76] them an unparallel opportunity to learn
[120.92 - 125.84] classical ha yoga in its full depth and
[123.76 - 128.92] vibrancy I'm excited to even learn from
[125.84 - 130.92] her she's also a yogic nutritionist
[128.92 - 133.16] something I want to quiz her about today
[130.92 - 136.08] and is also a diet and lifestyle expert
[133.16 - 138.24] schloka welcome to my podcast thank you
[136.08 - 139.64] it's a pleasure to be here you know
[138.24 - 143.52] Delhi School of
[139.64 - 146.08] economics and now a yogic guru what was
[143.52 - 149.72] the journey and how did it
[146.08 - 152.44] start it was one of inadequacy actually
[149.72 - 154.92] um um I've been the only
[152.44 - 156.56] child and being the only child and
[154.92 - 158.28] coming from a middle class family so
[156.56 - 161.20] I've been a 4G kid as I was mentioning
[158.28 - 163.96] to you uh my parents put me into a lot
[161.20 - 167.52] of things so I'm a trained pianist I was
[163.96 - 167.52] a swimmer I learned batnam
[168.04 - 172.28] dancing and I did reasonably well in
[170.88 - 176.04] whatever I
[172.28 - 179.16] did and then they came a point
[176.04 - 182.84] where despite being recognized as an
[179.16 - 187.80] achiever I didn't feel full within
[182.84 - 187.80] me so there's always an aspiration for a
[191.48 - 196.28] parent and I was an extension of that
[196.44 - 205.32] aspiration but when I came off age
[201.76 - 208.00] and Life Point you
[205.32 - 209.92] have done the tick mark all the check
[208.00 - 212.40] boxes all the check boxes followed that
[209.92 - 215.36] social script you're sitting here and
[212.40 - 218.04] you're not feeling good about
[215.36 - 220.44] yourself and I was between jobs and I
[218.04 - 223.48] was constantly changing my field of
[220.44 - 226.08] study and um changing
[223.48 - 227.32] jobs thinking the next best thing is
[226.08 - 229.04] going to give me that sense of
[227.32 - 231.48] satisfaction and contentment and not
[229.04 - 234.52] really quite sticking on with
[231.48 - 236.24] anything I was between jobs when my
[234.52 - 238.88] mother egged me to do this inner
[236.24 - 240.64] engineering program which is a flagship
[238.88 - 243.20] program of the ISA foundation and I was
[240.64 - 246.20] living in Bangalore in banata Road and I
[243.20 - 249.40] said t let's go there was no looking
[246.20 - 250.96] back thereafter uh so there is a
[249.40 - 252.80] particular meditation that one gets
[250.96 - 253.92] initiated into it's called The shambhu
[252.80 - 255.60] mahamudra
[253.92 - 257.72] Meditation I didn't have an earth
[255.60 - 260.76] shattering experience usually people say
[257.72 - 262.16] now meditation so you transcend and you
[260.76 - 264.92] know get into a different Zone nothing
[262.16 - 266.48] of that sort happened to me but I still
[264.92 - 267.96] remember that that particular day was
[266.48 - 270.96] one of the happiest days of my life and
[267.96 - 273.64] it just felt life was was at ease it was
[270.96 - 275.28] effortless for that one day it was just
[273.64 - 278.32] Ser it was Serene it was calm there was
[275.28 - 280.92] no tension for that one day and nothing
[278.32 - 282.56] significant happened on that day and
[280.92 - 284.64] since then it was just doing one program
[282.56 - 287.96] after the other and then coming to a
[284.64 - 290.20] point where I realized that I want to be
[287.96 - 292.48] a medium where I can impart this and
[290.20 - 294.36] make a difference in others life because
[292.48 - 297.16] this is the only reality I
[294.36 - 300.04] know and that is how my journey as a
[297.16 - 301.76] yoga teacher came about amazing so I I
[300.04 - 304.36] want to get a little bit deeper because
[301.76 - 307.32] you know I do a little bit of yoga I
[304.36 - 309.48] can't meditate my breath coach my breath
[307.32 - 311.24] coach works with me and he guides me
[309.48 - 314.12] through the meditation and I have a very
[311.24 - 316.76] flippant mindset it's it's it's a jumpy
[314.12 - 319.72] mindset so I I'm an always in awe of
[316.76 - 321.60] people who are yoga teachers people who
[319.72 - 324.44] teach meditation people who do
[321.60 - 327.80] meditation themselves so can you
[324.44 - 331.04] enlighten me on some of the modernday
[327.80 - 333.36] yogi rituals that
[331.04 - 336.16] all all a lot of us should aspire to or
[333.36 - 338.68] start doing to have this sort of not
[336.16 - 340.92] Nirvana but that Serene moment that you
[338.68 - 343.36] achieved firstly you would be surprised
[340.92 - 345.80] to know that I'm diagnosed with ADHD as
[343.36 - 347.52] an adult and I've taken medications for
[345.80 - 349.44] a brief period of my life I wouldn't
[347.52 - 352.72] have noticed that in today's podcast at
[349.44 - 356.28] all you're very
[352.72 - 357.72] calm so um and perhaps I lived with it I
[356.28 - 361.08] don't know but I was a sports person so
[357.72 - 363.56] I think a lot of that got worked out
[361.08 - 365.80] um when we say
[363.56 - 367.04] yoga the literal meaning of the word
[365.80 - 369.60] yoga is
[367.04 - 370.88] Union right it is not an exercise form
[369.60 - 373.68] as it is made out to be it's an
[370.88 - 373.68] experiential
[373.80 - 381.16] reality so when we say Union there is
[377.40 - 381.16] always an element of
[381.36 - 384.76] involvement there is a misunderstanding
[383.84 - 387.84] among
[384.76 - 390.08] many if you're doing one hour of
[387.84 - 391.76] yoga and going about with your day
[390.08 - 394.60] you've done your daily quota of yoga but
[391.76 - 396.76] that's not the case yoga has to be a
[394.60 - 399.28] moment to moment reality every moment I
[396.76 - 401.48] should be in yoga because if yoga
[399.28 - 404.12] literally means Union I cannot read
[401.48 - 406.96] about Union I can't do Union I can only
[404.12 - 410.20] experience Union and Union has to be a
[406.96 - 412.48] moment to moment reality so in this
[410.20 - 414.84] moment I'm having a conversation with
[412.48 - 417.84] you am I in yoga am I completely
[414.84 - 420.56] involved with you without any
[417.84 - 423.56] discrimination without any judg J ments
[420.56 - 426.32] that is Yoga I'm drinking this glass of
[423.56 - 428.20] water am I 100% involved with this
[426.32 - 431.20] process that's
[428.20 - 434.80] yoga doing the ASAS twisting and turning
[431.20 - 437.72] your body is just catalyzing the
[434.80 - 440.20] process but it doesn't stop there so
[437.72 - 441.72] that's the biggest misconception that
[440.20 - 445.44] people
[441.72 - 448.04] have yoga has to be a 24x7 process so
[445.44 - 450.20] that's the first
[448.04 - 453.40] thing having said said that there are
[450.20 - 455.96] various prescriptions uh which
[453.40 - 458.40] facilitate the state of
[455.96 - 460.88] involvement the first thing being waking
[458.40 - 462.92] up at Braham hurat what is Brahma Murat
[460.88 - 465.08] Brahma Murat would be considered the
[462.92 - 467.64] last quarter of the night which is
[465.08 - 469.40] anywhere between 3:30 a.m. to 5:30 or
[467.64 - 472.36] 6:00
[469.40 - 475.44] a.m. scientifically we say that the
[472.36 - 478.60] pineal gland is working at its
[475.44 - 480.20] best the secretion of the Pinal gland
[478.60 - 482.36] the Melatonin the all of them are
[480.20 - 484.32] working at its maximum which means that
[482.36 - 485.96] being in a pleasant mood within yourself
[484.32 - 488.72] is not a
[485.96 - 490.56] problem also I believe that the nature
[488.72 - 492.16] is aligned the planets are aligned in
[490.56 - 495.12] such a manner
[492.16 - 498.84] that it creates a conducive state for
[495.12 - 501.92] you to sort of grasp anything or for you
[498.84 - 505.48] to be in a certain balanced
[501.92 - 507.32] state so typically we would utilize this
[505.48 - 509.72] time period in fact there is another
[507.32 - 512.12] study which shows that the quality of
[509.72 - 513.88] your urine is very different at this
[512.12 - 515.84] particular time in comparison to any
[513.88 - 520.28] time any other time during the
[515.84 - 522.24] day so the idea is to wake up and do a
[520.28 - 524.12] practice that you have been initiated
[522.24 - 525.56] into now when we say initiation it's
[524.12 - 529.72] about
[525.56 - 532.52] learning a yoga practice which affects
[529.72 - 534.80] your pronic system which affects your
[532.52 - 538.24] Energy System what is pronic
[534.80 - 540.08] system so there are multiple bodies
[538.24 - 542.36] within a human system so there is a
[540.08 - 546.36] physical body which is the anosha or the
[542.36 - 549.52] food body there is the manoosha or the
[546.36 - 551.96] Mind Body there is a Prana mosha which
[549.52 - 554.24] is the energy body and there is the
[551.96 - 556.56] vigana mosha I don't know the English
[554.24 - 560.36] equivalent of that knowledge body not
[556.56 - 561.80] quite vigana mosha and Anand mosha which
[560.36 - 567.32] is the Bliss
[561.80 - 570.04] body so what yoga is doing is that it
[567.32 - 572.56] goes to the pranay kosha which is the
[570.04 - 576.32] energy body
[572.56 - 579.72] and the help of a guru comes where you
[576.32 - 582.20] have to be pushed from the pranam kosha
[579.72 - 584.36] to the other dimensions further up Vian
[582.20 - 586.80] kosha Anand kosha that a guru can do for
[584.36 - 589.64] you which is why having a guru in your
[586.80 - 591.92] life becomes important but any teacher
[589.64 - 594.72] Any teacher who's been trained who has
[591.92 - 597.92] some good intention for you can take you
[594.72 - 600.76] to pranam kosha once the pranam kosha or
[597.92 - 603.00] the energy body is activated it you will
[600.76 - 605.16] see that its benefits permeate down to
[603.00 - 607.24] the mental body so your mind is great
[605.16 - 609.92] and the physical body which is why if
[607.24 - 611.92] you see a lot of yogis especially the
[609.92 - 613.80] ones who are living in the Himalayas or
[611.92 - 615.04] somewhere let's say in the forest they
[613.80 - 616.96] don't know what they're eating they
[615.04 - 618.68] don't know what they're drinking there
[616.96 - 620.48] are minor poisons coming into their food
[618.68 - 622.20] and water all the time but you'll see
[620.48 - 624.32] that they're in great physical health
[622.20 - 626.16] their sleep qua is very Less in fact
[624.32 - 628.08] they don't even sleep there is a culture
[626.16 - 630.76] among so many yogis where they don't
[628.08 - 632.24] sleep at all because we say that sleep
[630.76 - 634.60] is a form of inertia and you want to
[632.24 - 636.92] reduce that to the best possible extent
[634.60 - 639.28] now they're not falling sick and the
[636.92 - 641.76] reason is that the pranam kosha or the
[639.28 - 645.68] energy body is fully activated and is in
[641.76 - 647.88] full flow so this is what uh the pranam
[645.68 - 649.92] myosha is so when you wake up in the
[647.88 - 651.72] morning and do your spiritual work or
[649.92 - 655.68] your sadhana as we say your yoga
[651.72 - 657.64] practice it activates your pranam mosha
[655.68 - 661.00] which means that your mind will be great
[657.64 - 662.52] and your body will be perfect
[661.00 - 664.36] before that we say You must take a
[662.52 - 667.00] shower in the morning and a cold water
[664.36 - 668.76] shower preferably uh I was going to ask
[667.00 - 671.56] you about that because a lot of people
[668.76 - 673.60] do take a warm water bath in the morning
[671.56 - 675.28] and so how does the how did the
[673.60 - 676.48] different bodies join together with the
[675.28 - 679.08] cold
[676.48 - 681.48] shower so when we say cold shower we're
[679.08 - 684.12] not looking like we're not looking at uh
[681.48 - 687.20] a temperature which is very very cold uh
[684.12 - 689.44] this would be anywhere say 5 to 8°
[687.20 - 691.28] Centigrade below the room temperature
[689.44 - 693.04] and this is simply because
[691.28 - 694.92] scientifically speaking we say that
[693.04 - 697.52] there are poses between the cells and
[694.92 - 700.80] when you take a cold water shower that
[697.52 - 704.00] opens up and energy begins to permeate
[700.80 - 705.64] it enters and it recharges the cellular
[704.00 - 707.56] structure so as a result of which you're
[705.64 - 709.32] much more energized you can do your sadh
[707.56 - 711.32] without you know feeling
[709.32 - 713.12] drowsy and if it's let's say you're
[711.32 - 715.08] living in cold climatic conditions then
[713.12 - 716.80] we say lukewarm water but never hot
[715.08 - 718.60] water because the hot water opens up the
[716.80 - 719.76] cells and it creates inertia and
[718.60 - 721.48] drowsiness
[719.76 - 723.44] now for a regular individuals who's not
[721.48 - 726.16] into yoga sadna it may not matter but
[723.44 - 728.44] for a yogi who is staying up for a long
[726.16 - 730.16] time who's doing about 4 hours of sadna
[728.44 - 732.00] it can become
[730.16 - 734.40] problematic additionally I think there
[732.00 - 736.88] is a lot of literature Now by Andrew
[734.40 - 738.60] huberman for example who has extensively
[736.88 - 740.68] researched on the importance of the
[738.60 - 743.52] dopamine release
[740.68 - 745.16] correct so uh so K sha becomes very
[743.52 - 746.72] important in the life of a yogi and we
[745.16 - 749.80] always say that you start from here and
[746.72 - 752.88] then allow the water to trickle down
[749.80 - 754.92] after that the most important thing is
[752.88 - 756.96] emptying your bows first thing when you
[754.92 - 759.16] wake up so in all of this cold shower
[756.96 - 761.12] and empting your balls and urination
[759.16 - 764.00] should be done before you start your
[761.12 - 766.24] practice always when you wake up first
[764.00 - 768.64] thing in the morning so in traditional
[766.24 - 771.68] Sciences B Yoga ayurveda we say that the
[768.64 - 773.96] headquarter of most
[771.68 - 776.72] diseases is the
[773.96 - 780.16] colon 90% of the diseases that we know
[776.72 - 783.80] chronic or otherwise is in the colon PID
[780.16 - 785.88] sa not just PID sa are you able to
[783.80 - 788.16] completely evacuate your BS so we say it
[785.88 - 789.92] should be as clean as a water pipe in
[788.16 - 791.36] fact there's a culture among the yogis a
[789.92 - 794.00] certain sect of yogis where they use the
[791.36 - 795.88] anal cavity as a suction pipe they suck
[794.00 - 797.68] the water in they'll sit in a pool of
[795.88 - 799.68] water suck it in and then Purge it
[797.68 - 803.56] through their mouth and it's squeaky
[799.68 - 805.28] clean wow so colon health is very very
[803.56 - 807.52] important gut health becomes very
[805.28 - 809.48] important and doing your practices on an
[807.52 - 811.28] empty stomach becomes important because
[809.48 - 813.16] there is a certain ascendance of energy
[811.28 - 815.04] when you're doing your sadh you will
[813.16 - 818.80] feel that as you become more sensitive
[815.04 - 821.64] and aware that the Energy starts moving
[818.80 - 823.80] upwards there is feces it's going to get
[821.64 - 825.92] blocked so this is why as a sports
[823.80 - 830.48] nutritionist I've always never been able
[825.92 - 832.84] to understand why yogig don't sip any
[830.48 - 835.52] sports drink or protein powder or
[832.84 - 837.64] anything before their yoga practice even
[835.52 - 839.68] though it's very intensive it's because
[837.64 - 842.00] that chakras or those energy is com in
[839.68 - 844.08] from the essence of your core am I right
[842.00 - 845.64] in that they could come from the lower
[844.08 - 847.60] Dimensions we don't know what that
[845.64 - 850.12] Dimensions is that would be dependent on
[847.60 - 851.52] your state of evolution my CH my energy
[850.12 - 853.00] could start from here yours could start
[851.52 - 854.80] from here we don't know but the idea is
[853.00 - 856.24] that there is a certain upward movement
[854.80 - 858.28] and we don't want to and putting food in
[856.24 - 860.84] at that time kind of hinders hinders you
[858.28 - 863.20] from discovering it or tapping into your
[860.84 - 865.60] best energy source and allowing it to
[863.20 - 870.04] move upward essentially speaking of
[865.60 - 872.76] energy you know um I am ignorant of AA I
[870.04 - 875.44] read but I'm not a trained expert I'm a
[872.76 - 878.00] nutritionist and you hear this word
[875.44 - 881.04] kapap and then doas so I want to start
[878.00 - 882.72] off with what are doas and are these
[881.04 - 884.60] building blocks then can that can
[882.72 - 887.60] determine what diet and lifestyle can
[884.60 - 889.28] follow so as a yogic instructor give me
[887.60 - 894.20] your take on
[889.28 - 896.48] that yoga and ayurveda are good together
[894.20 - 898.12] but they do diverge at several places
[896.48 - 900.52] because again ayurva was meant for a
[898.12 - 902.36] different audience yogis have still a
[900.52 - 904.12] different set of prescriptions and
[902.36 - 905.88] you'll see at a lot of places and I get
[904.12 - 908.20] this question a lot because we do this
[905.88 - 909.64] online diet yogic diet program and when
[908.20 - 911.52] I talk about certain things they turn
[909.64 - 913.12] around and say oh but ayurva says this
[911.52 - 914.04] and I said they're not the same Sciences
[913.12 - 916.96] they're very
[914.04 - 919.64] different talking about ayurva vak kafa
[916.96 - 922.24] is predominantly an aurvedic
[919.64 - 925.56] construct they also known as practis
[922.24 - 929.24] practis are Constitution so either I
[925.56 - 932.12] could have a Vata prti or a p prri is
[929.24 - 933.80] like a constitution Constitution okay
[932.12 - 936.00] what are these Constitution uh what is
[933.80 - 939.36] the Constitution these are certain
[936.00 - 942.00] factors which come together to decide
[939.36 - 944.80] how my physiology functions body and the
[942.00 - 947.20] mind who decides this your genes your
[944.80 - 949.32] genetic your DNA what you inherited from
[947.20 - 951.28] yog I should discover this myself or my
[949.32 - 956.12] yogic instructor will kind of look at me
[951.28 - 959.12] and tell me what is my um what is my
[956.12 - 961.64] composition a an ayurvedic doctor do
[959.12 - 963.56] something called nari parik so they
[961.64 - 965.12] check your naris it's not a pulse
[963.56 - 968.08] they'll check your naris and they'll see
[965.12 - 970.96] what is on with that so what is
[968.08 - 972.32] viated where is the problem is Vata down
[970.96 - 974.32] is kafa down and they'll be able to
[972.32 - 979.28] diagnose you and tell you what your
[974.32 - 981.84] Constitution is again with um India in
[979.28 - 985.20] general losing its spiritual pulse and a
[981.84 - 988.08] lot of people thinking b m degree and we
[985.20 - 991.12] become AIC doctors you know let me start
[988.08 - 994.96] prescribing a lot of that awareness is
[991.12 - 996.24] getting lost so an AIC doctor will check
[994.96 - 999.36] your pulse and they'll be able to
[996.24 - 1001.44] diagnose you a yogi or a yoga
[999.36 - 1004.28] practitioner may not necessarily need
[1001.44 - 1006.56] that because they'll have that sense
[1004.28 - 1008.84] inherently so to answer your question it
[1006.56 - 1010.84] works both ways it depends on how aware
[1008.84 - 1012.20] you are and how sensitive you are about
[1010.84 - 1015.84] your own
[1012.20 - 1017.88] system got it so it's very interesting
[1015.84 - 1020.72] because what I'm hearing and feeling of
[1017.88 - 1023.00] you is that you vibrate at a certain
[1020.72 - 1025.28] frequency that's the language that I
[1023.00 - 1027.00] understand and food vibrates at a
[1025.28 - 1029.12] certain frequency and you're able to
[1027.00 - 1031.04] become aware of what you should or
[1029.12 - 1033.80] should not be putting into your body now
[1031.04 - 1037.80] holding on that thought what's your
[1033.80 - 1040.64] viewpoint on fruits and vegetables as an
[1037.80 - 1043.28] individual and as a yogic instructor to
[1040.64 - 1045.84] your students the fruit and vegetables
[1043.28 - 1050.16] do I do a fruit salad do I do juices
[1045.84 - 1050.16] what's your take on that
[1051.16 - 1057.36] so it is okay to put a blanket judgment
[1054.40 - 1059.48] in my understanding um and say that
[1057.36 - 1061.56] fruits is something everybody can
[1059.48 - 1063.84] consume because what it does
[1061.56 - 1066.20] fundamentally is that it ignites your
[1063.84 - 1070.28] digestive fire which we call as AG or
[1066.20 - 1073.32] jhat AG so in yoga we say 30% of your
[1070.28 - 1073.32] diet should be
[1073.48 - 1076.96] fruits and a certain amount I don't
[1075.44 - 1079.08] think we're doing that in today's day in
[1076.96 - 1081.04] the world lot of processed food no
[1079.08 - 1083.04] fruits at all we eat one fruit and we
[1081.04 - 1086.96] think that you know it's enough so sorry
[1083.04 - 1089.24] 30% is fruit 30% is fruits and we say
[1086.96 - 1090.84] that the remainder can be remainder 20%
[1089.24 - 1094.32] can be your
[1090.84 - 1097.40] salad so 50% raw food and 50% cooked
[1094.32 - 1100.56] food is the kind of ratio that we would
[1097.40 - 1103.96] take as far as consumption of fruits are
[1100.56 - 1107.00] concerned uh it is always best if it is
[1103.96 - 1108.48] consumed Standalone and it is always
[1107.00 - 1110.68] best that if you leave a certain gap
[1108.48 - 1112.64] between let's say your fruit and the
[1110.68 - 1115.12] remainder of your meal let's say one and
[1112.64 - 1117.36] a one one to 1 and a half hours Gap even
[1115.12 - 1119.04] between fruit and salad it is advisable
[1117.36 - 1121.68] that you leave at least half to 1 hour
[1119.04 - 1123.16] gap why because the digestive times of
[1121.68 - 1125.72] both of these are very
[1123.16 - 1127.84] different I totally agree with that and
[1125.72 - 1131.00] that's I've always practiced that in my
[1127.84 - 1134.04] clinical practice it's from Common Sense
[1131.00 - 1137.08] logic an apple would digest at different
[1134.04 - 1140.36] rate as compared to say a cucumber or a
[1137.08 - 1143.20] salad Leaf the sugar content in an apple
[1140.36 - 1145.80] is different from the cellulose content
[1143.20 - 1147.84] in in a vegetable so the water content
[1145.80 - 1150.64] water content yes absolutely so it's
[1147.84 - 1153.28] very interesting that ancient Indian
[1150.64 - 1156.64] practices have directed us to understand
[1153.28 - 1158.96] our energy and understand our foods and
[1156.64 - 1161.32] the digestion energy that comes out of
[1158.96 - 1164.44] that so that's something that's very
[1161.32 - 1168.00] interesting speaking of digestion the
[1164.44 - 1169.84] other part of digestion fasting we talk
[1168.00 - 1171.88] about the Circadian Rhythm I do genetic
[1169.84 - 1173.36] testing of the Circadian rhythm some
[1171.88 - 1176.48] people are morning clocks some people
[1173.36 - 1177.88] are evening clocks as a yogic instructor
[1176.48 - 1179.04] what are your teachings and what are
[1177.88 - 1181.60] your
[1179.04 - 1186.20] learnings from sadguru's point of view
[1181.60 - 1188.04] on fasting and if it is encouraged how
[1186.20 - 1189.32] can the human race cuz I always reflect
[1188.04 - 1191.40] this that the human race is eating too
[1189.32 - 1194.36] much of food today but to tell them to
[1191.40 - 1197.40] fast is like asking them to give up uh
[1194.36 - 1199.40] you know their car or giving up hot
[1197.40 - 1202.68] water shs fasting is something very
[1199.40 - 1202.68] delicate what's your take on
[1202.88 - 1208.24] fasting so in ayurva there is a term
[1205.40 - 1210.00] called langana param aadam which means
[1208.24 - 1213.76] that again
[1210.00 - 1215.12] Lana aadam okay which means fasting is
[1213.76 - 1216.84] the ultimate
[1215.12 - 1219.88] medicine
[1216.84 - 1221.96] powerful very important both Aura and
[1219.88 - 1224.24] yoga would endorse
[1221.96 - 1226.44] it how we would do it is there something
[1224.24 - 1228.92] called ekadashi which comes about once
[1226.44 - 1232.12] in 15 days in about 40 to 48 days you
[1228.92 - 1233.56] would experience based on the moon cycle
[1232.12 - 1236.56] I keep hearing this term from my clients
[1233.56 - 1238.04] ekadashi ekadashi so I was like aashi
[1236.56 - 1239.60] and I was thinking okay one time I'm
[1238.04 - 1241.88] going to fast like they're negotiating
[1239.60 - 1245.08] with me but now I understand it's like
[1241.88 - 1247.80] that Luna cycle period that you get into
[1245.08 - 1249.36] it I am not very sure astrologically
[1247.80 - 1251.48] what's happening up there but I do know
[1249.36 - 1252.56] that there are certain alignments in the
[1251.48 - 1254.88] cosmic
[1252.56 - 1257.52] space where so is there a calendar for
[1254.88 - 1260.12] this so I can Google up which which day
[1257.52 - 1262.72] is ekadashi and then do the absolutely
[1260.12 - 1265.40] the lunar calendar okay so certain
[1262.72 - 1268.04] factors these alignments do you fast on
[1265.40 - 1269.64] that day I do and and your fast is like
[1268.04 - 1271.72] no water also you have water no no I
[1269.64 - 1274.96] have water okay any other Foods allowed
[1271.72 - 1278.20] in the akadashi day I would think
[1274.96 - 1280.72] cucumber so that would again depend on
[1278.20 - 1282.36] where the person is how comfortable the
[1280.72 - 1285.16] individual is fasting because you never
[1282.36 - 1286.64] want to force the first person to fast
[1285.16 - 1287.84] so let's say they're into Yoga practices
[1286.64 - 1289.88] and they're able to fast like you're a
[1287.84 - 1291.56] veteran and you can just go all out but
[1289.88 - 1293.24] if you're a novice you're kind of
[1291.56 - 1295.32] flexible and stuff like that yes so we
[1293.24 - 1297.16] say you do a fahar or a fruit diet if
[1295.32 - 1298.84] you're not comfortable fasting and if
[1297.16 - 1300.32] you feel hungry in between then you can
[1298.84 - 1301.80] have an amla with let's say some salt
[1300.32 - 1304.40] because it tends to curb the hunger
[1301.80 - 1306.84] pangs otherwise it is fasting let's say
[1304.40 - 1309.20] aachis tomorrow I've had my dinner today
[1306.84 - 1311.48] I'm not going to be eating Hereafter and
[1309.20 - 1312.76] I will break my fasting with the meal
[1311.48 - 1315.76] that I have tomorrow which would be
[1312.76 - 1319.36] something light let's say kanji
[1315.76 - 1321.48] kitri uh papaya very light foods but
[1319.36 - 1323.04] otherwise you have water in in yoga we
[1321.48 - 1325.68] also have NE and turmeric early in the
[1323.04 - 1327.40] morning like raw NE leaves and a balll
[1325.68 - 1329.24] of turmeric we'll have that we'll take a
[1327.40 - 1330.24] little honey laed water in the morning
[1329.24 - 1333.60] and you're having you're doing your
[1330.24 - 1336.00] regular work so that is fasting
[1333.60 - 1339.68] awesome would you as a yogic instructor
[1336.00 - 1343.00] do 2 three days in a row no
[1339.68 - 1345.48] why only because it isn't prescribed and
[1343.00 - 1347.32] internally uh I haven't felt the need to
[1345.48 - 1348.92] because as yoga practitioners we're only
[1347.32 - 1350.40] eating two times a day so in any case
[1348.92 - 1353.32] you are following a sort of intermittent
[1350.40 - 1355.04] fasting schedule so I'm eating let's say
[1353.32 - 1356.92] the first meal is between 10 and 11 and
[1355.04 - 1358.84] the second meal is between 7 and 8 it's
[1356.92 - 1360.64] it's a full meal and let's say if I am
[1358.84 - 1363.16] into intense physical activity then in
[1360.64 - 1366.68] the afternoon I might take a
[1363.16 - 1369.32] fruit so eat eat to Your Capacity don't
[1366.68 - 1372.68] overeat is part of the yogic
[1369.32 - 1376.88] practice um speaking of eating to our
[1372.68 - 1379.56] heart's contempt you know I get I'm a
[1376.88 - 1382.08] huge prescription
[1379.56 - 1385.40] nutritionist for raw fruits and raw
[1382.08 - 1387.48] vegetables as you said um what's your
[1385.40 - 1390.28] take on the raw
[1387.48 - 1393.40] veggies and when if you you know you're
[1390.28 - 1395.40] a yogic nutritionist when would you
[1393.40 - 1397.40] prescribe okay this is the time for you
[1395.40 - 1400.08] to eat raw
[1397.40 - 1402.48] vegetables raw vegetables great for the
[1400.08 - 1403.80] gut in fact uh I think some nutritionist
[1402.48 - 1406.16] somewhere had mentioned that it acts
[1403.80 - 1407.88] like a brush in your system you know the
[1406.16 - 1409.76] the toilet brush it comes and it
[1407.88 - 1412.88] cleanses because of the fiber content
[1409.76 - 1415.32] cont the water content yes uh the only
[1412.88 - 1417.04] time this becomes uh we need to exercise
[1415.32 - 1418.76] some caution is if there's an individual
[1417.04 - 1419.76] with a weak digestive system let's say
[1418.76 - 1422.36] an
[1419.76 - 1424.56] IBS or a Vata prri let's say if the
[1422.36 - 1426.80] element of vayu a person with a Vata
[1424.56 - 1428.60] prri would have more of the air element
[1426.80 - 1431.32] you know they would be gassy they would
[1428.60 - 1432.88] be leaning towards constipation or
[1431.32 - 1434.84] diarrhea the extreme so we would say you
[1432.88 - 1437.52] exercise caution uh but otherwise
[1434.84 - 1439.68] there's no problem um and we would say
[1437.52 - 1441.32] before meals not not with meals again
[1439.68 - 1443.32] the digestive times are very different
[1441.32 - 1445.92] so a salad a raw food always gets
[1443.32 - 1448.40] digested quickly viser a cooked meal so
[1445.92 - 1450.00] you have it first leave a gap if you can
[1448.40 - 1451.56] otherwise have the fruits have the
[1450.00 - 1454.20] fruits and the salad first and then
[1451.56 - 1456.12] follow that up with cooked meals and we
[1454.20 - 1457.68] say any individual above the age of 30
[1456.12 - 1459.28] should have two meals a day because your
[1457.68 - 1461.04] metabolic fire keeps going down you
[1459.28 - 1463.04] can't give it the same amount of meal as
[1461.04 - 1464.28] you were when you were in your 20s and
[1463.04 - 1466.60] also because we have to maintain an
[1464.28 - 1468.44] empty stomach condition for our sad you
[1466.60 - 1470.28] know shloka is very very interesting I'm
[1468.44 - 1472.40] not formally trained in aura or yogic
[1470.28 - 1475.28] science or anything I'm trained in
[1472.40 - 1477.48] Medical Nutrition and when we slap on
[1475.28 - 1479.68] the continuous glucose monitoring device
[1477.48 - 1482.12] these small devices that monitor your
[1479.68 - 1485.12] blood glucose levels I have seen
[1482.12 - 1488.60] patients and clients when we do the raw
[1485.12 - 1491.12] vegetable first and then we do the
[1488.60 - 1494.88] protein and then we do the grain the
[1491.12 - 1498.16] glucose spike is actually the least okay
[1494.88 - 1500.36] so there is an ancient wisdom and Truth
[1498.16 - 1502.76] which which are sages discovered without
[1500.36 - 1504.80] any of this technology so what you're
[1502.76 - 1507.80] actually seeing actually resonates with
[1504.80 - 1509.96] me where I tell people start with a
[1507.80 - 1511.76] salad first so my mom and me always have
[1509.96 - 1513.16] this argument she's born in the
[1511.76 - 1515.20] Portuguese culture where we do soup
[1513.16 - 1517.84] first and soup is cooked vegetable and I
[1515.20 - 1520.12] say no no let's do salad first then we
[1517.84 - 1522.36] do the soup and then we do the grain
[1520.12 - 1524.80] which is the bread or the rice with a
[1522.36 - 1527.52] little bit of your lentils or your DS
[1524.80 - 1529.36] and so there is ancient wisdom over
[1527.52 - 1532.16] there and the C GM devices actually
[1529.36 - 1533.76] prove that so I mean it'll be very
[1532.16 - 1536.16] interesting to put a CGM device on you
[1533.76 - 1539.92] and see how your blood sugar level never
[1536.16 - 1542.52] fluctuates um speaking about fluctuating
[1539.92 - 1546.48] levels in the human
[1542.52 - 1549.12] body I always practice as a judge of
[1546.48 - 1550.68] food I never take a side I never take a
[1549.12 - 1551.92] negative or a positive I'm never the
[1550.68 - 1555.20] prosecutor
[1551.92 - 1557.52] defendant in yogic and yoga instructors
[1555.20 - 1559.48] and ayic specialist and this whole
[1557.52 - 1563.84] spirituality of diet perspective in
[1559.48 - 1566.04] India what's your take on milk H
[1563.84 - 1568.84] ayurveda as a science is completely form
[1566.04 - 1572.56] milk in fact it's supposed to
[1568.84 - 1574.64] be life a Giver of Life so from the
[1572.56 - 1576.76] cow's milk to the Camel's milk to the
[1574.64 - 1579.16] buffalo's milk to the donkey milk to the
[1576.76 - 1582.48] goats goats milk if you go back into the
[1579.16 - 1584.60] shastras all these traditional texts for
[1582.48 - 1586.48] every disease there will be one milk
[1584.60 - 1588.00] that will be prescribed so out of all of
[1586.48 - 1590.80] these the cow's milk is supposed to be
[1588.00 - 1593.20] not just the most sacred but also best
[1590.80 - 1595.52] in terms of nutrition because the DNA of
[1593.20 - 1598.64] AA and the human is very close both in
[1595.52 - 1601.16] yoga and in Aura we've concluded this so
[1598.64 - 1603.12] it's next to the breast milk uh so cow's
[1601.16 - 1605.64] milk and that to the grass-fed cow the
[1603.12 - 1610.32] A2 not the hybrid cow the A2 the Indian
[1605.64 - 1612.76] grass-fed cow in yoga it's a no because
[1610.32 - 1614.36] it is believed uh I don't know whether
[1612.76 - 1616.36] there's any science packing this up but
[1614.36 - 1617.88] this is purely uh like I mentioned it's
[1616.36 - 1619.00] an experiential science so the yogis
[1617.88 - 1621.40] know what what happening within your
[1619.00 - 1623.72] system through
[1621.40 - 1625.64] awareness the enzymes of milk are sticky
[1623.72 - 1627.92] in nature we in fact say that it's used
[1625.64 - 1630.20] as an adhesive in the in the industry in
[1627.92 - 1632.12] the textile industry so when it enters
[1630.20 - 1633.56] you it sticks to the colon as a result
[1632.12 - 1636.36] of which you get constipated now
[1633.56 - 1637.56] constipation may not be that my stools
[1636.36 - 1639.16] are hard but it's just that it's
[1637.56 - 1641.00] preventing that complete evacuation
[1639.16 - 1643.36] which is preventing my gut to be squeaky
[1641.00 - 1644.80] clean and for a yoga practitioner like I
[1643.36 - 1647.76] mentioned that's the most important
[1644.80 - 1649.44] thing because the gut is connected with
[1647.76 - 1652.84] your mind now you want the meditator to
[1649.44 - 1654.64] sit in meditation for perhaps even hours
[1652.84 - 1656.92] with an unclean gut it's going to impact
[1654.64 - 1658.60] the mind and it's going to be that's the
[1656.92 - 1661.12] latest in medical science today where we
[1658.60 - 1662.88] have the Mind gut connection which I
[1661.12 - 1665.64] think the
[1662.88 - 1670.12] yogic incapacity is the name of my
[1665.64 - 1672.84] clinic qua so the yogic resonate from
[1670.12 - 1675.52] discovering their qua for every food so
[1672.84 - 1677.48] that's like you know I mean we had to go
[1675.52 - 1678.92] to Medical Science to learn this and
[1677.48 - 1680.72] study this
[1678.92 - 1683.28] but this is really nice because it's
[1680.72 - 1685.08] like you're I feel you're like a magnet
[1683.28 - 1687.32] and you're vibrating at a frequency and
[1685.08 - 1689.60] then you know what food you put into you
[1687.32 - 1691.76] and does that food vibrate with you or
[1689.60 - 1693.64] does that food vibrate against you so
[1691.76 - 1696.04] that's something really nice you know my
[1693.64 - 1698.36] team of researchers they put together
[1696.04 - 1700.52] some nice questions so I have no idea
[1698.36 - 1703.08] what I'm asking you right now but what
[1700.52 - 1705.36] is virud aara and what do I need to be
[1703.08 - 1708.12] educated about it and what are the
[1705.36 - 1710.80] mistakes we the making the most about so
[1708.12 - 1714.48] viru means incompatible and ahara means
[1710.80 - 1717.16] food so viru ahar are combinations of
[1714.48 - 1719.04] incompatible food so in traditional
[1717.16 - 1720.20] Sciences such as yoga we say that in
[1719.04 - 1722.08] your plate you shouldn't have more than
[1720.20 - 1723.80] two or three food items because if it is
[1722.08 - 1727.64] any more than that it would manifest in
[1723.80 - 1729.92] the form of diseases so not just you
[1727.64 - 1731.80] should not just limit yourself to those
[1729.92 - 1734.12] two to three food items but also ensure
[1731.80 - 1737.40] that they're compatible they go along
[1734.12 - 1740.60] with one another so one of the classic
[1737.40 - 1743.04] incompat combinations that most of us
[1740.60 - 1745.16] follow these days is hot and cold water
[1743.04 - 1746.84] P I don't have the time I'm rushing for
[1745.16 - 1750.08] work and then I just put some cold water
[1746.84 - 1752.92] and dilute it that's verar for you right
[1750.08 - 1754.64] there milk and fish milk and any other
[1752.92 - 1757.12] meat item so the chicken biryani is
[1754.64 - 1759.08] actually disastrous for the system
[1757.12 - 1761.68] because one is that chicken and rice
[1759.08 - 1763.80] don't go together both are high on fats
[1761.68 - 1766.40] and the other is they marinate the
[1763.80 - 1768.24] chicken with thei these days with kurd
[1766.40 - 1770.12] you have it with raita sometimes so
[1768.24 - 1772.92] compatible
[1770.12 - 1775.44] combinations uh honey should never be
[1772.92 - 1776.84] heated we say whenever honey is heated
[1775.44 - 1778.56] it crosses a certain temperature it
[1776.84 - 1780.76] becomes poisonous so you never cook in
[1778.56 - 1783.68] honey you should just ensure that when
[1780.76 - 1786.12] your uh water is maybe slightly cooler
[1783.68 - 1787.88] or let's say in lukewarm that is when
[1786.12 - 1790.48] you lace it with a little bit of
[1787.88 - 1792.60] honey uh there are several such you know
[1790.48 - 1795.96] incompatible food combinations another
[1792.60 - 1797.16] one being milk and fruits so fruit
[1795.96 - 1798.40] milkshakes are the worst thing and
[1797.16 - 1800.44] banana milkshake is the the worst of
[1798.40 - 1803.36] them all very very highly in
[1800.44 - 1806.00] incompatible with each other and uh we
[1803.36 - 1808.32] say in yogic sciences that one reason
[1806.00 - 1810.04] allergies are on a rise is because of
[1808.32 - 1811.92] these incompatible food
[1810.04 - 1813.76] combinations so you know that's very
[1811.92 - 1816.04] interesting
[1813.76 - 1818.56] because you know when I practice as a
[1816.04 - 1821.16] medical nutritionist and a sports
[1818.56 - 1824.12] nutritionist one key driver at the back
[1821.16 - 1828.04] of my head is not academics or
[1824.12 - 1832.08] scientific study it's Common Sense logic
[1828.04 - 1834.44] very similar to this virud aara which is
[1832.08 - 1836.52] if you lived 500 years ago we didn't
[1834.44 - 1837.96] have supermarkets we didn't have
[1836.52 - 1840.72] yearlong
[1837.96 - 1844.44] availability we ate in
[1840.72 - 1847.36] Simplicity one or two items on our plate
[1844.44 - 1850.76] we didn't have a buffet on a plate and I
[1847.36 - 1853.52] think this concept of gastronomy
[1850.76 - 1855.12] explosion and mixing pallets and mixing
[1853.52 - 1858.92] foods and
[1855.12 - 1861.00] affluence yeah affluence I mean
[1858.92 - 1864.24] we human RAC is eating more than it
[1861.00 - 1867.08] requires so I think this is this is a
[1864.24 - 1870.24] concept that if we could convince people
[1867.08 - 1872.28] to go back to our roots and just use
[1870.24 - 1875.08] common sense like I tell people and
[1872.28 - 1877.44] people say that what what should I drink
[1875.08 - 1879.56] and I just say drink water cuz if you
[1877.44 - 1882.20] and I lived a thousand years ago we went
[1879.56 - 1884.08] to a stream and we collected the water
[1882.20 - 1885.96] and we drank water it's as simple as
[1884.08 - 1887.24] that but today you have milk you have
[1885.96 - 1888.44] almond milk you have coconut milk you
[1887.24 - 1890.04] have tea you have coffee you have
[1888.44 - 1891.40] milkshake you have this shake you have
[1890.04 - 1894.48] that shake you have this beverage that
[1891.40 - 1895.56] tree and I don't think we need to mix
[1894.48 - 1898.52] all of these things and now I'm
[1895.56 - 1899.88] beginning to understand your sense of
[1898.52 - 1903.20] the
[1899.88 - 1907.44] vibration of the cosmos the vibration of
[1903.20 - 1909.88] the human body and the vibration of
[1907.44 - 1912.60] food so you can be a body that has to
[1909.88 - 1913.68] vibrate with the cosmos right do all
[1912.60 - 1915.88] your yogic
[1913.68 - 1919.08] practice but you could poison that
[1915.88 - 1921.84] practice when you put the wrong food as
[1919.08 - 1923.36] it vibrates inside of you so it all
[1921.84 - 1925.12] begins with the food body and then you
[1923.36 - 1927.92] go upwards I've learned something today
[1925.12 - 1929.60] in terms of I would like to call it the
[1927.92 - 1932.96] quantum energy
[1929.60 - 1936.04] signature of our existence on the planet
[1932.96 - 1938.08] and each one of us vibrate at a certain
[1936.04 - 1940.80] frequency and when you get your
[1938.08 - 1943.56] spiritual body or your pric body or
[1940.80 - 1946.36] whichever bodies that you talked about
[1943.56 - 1948.56] to vibrate one after the other just
[1946.36 - 1951.20] putting the wrong Foods in your body
[1948.56 - 1953.88] causes those vibrations to clash with
[1951.20 - 1955.56] absolutely So speaking about vibrations
[1953.88 - 1958.44] and
[1955.56 - 1961.28] clashing the human
[1958.44 - 1965.20] race is contaminating the human body
[1961.28 - 1966.68] it's not treating it as as holy vessel
[1965.20 - 1969.12] what are some of the things as a yogic
[1966.68 - 1971.40] instructor you would give to me as
[1969.12 - 1974.52] advice or your students as advice in
[1971.40 - 1976.64] terms of detoxifying the body so
[1974.52 - 1979.04] obviously yes there will be a lot of
[1976.64 - 1981.28] exercises that you could do tell me some
[1979.04 - 1983.00] of those and from a detox point of view
[1981.28 - 1985.32] and a food point of view what would you
[1983.00 - 1987.24] do as a yogic
[1985.32 - 1991.64] nutritionist uh when it comes to the
[1987.24 - 1992.80] Yoga practices yoga um Works in entirety
[1991.64 - 1994.48] yoga will never just look at your
[1992.80 - 1996.56] kidneys or just look at your spine yes
[1994.48 - 2000.28] there are certain practices that
[1996.56 - 2003.32] could uh stress on that faculty of your
[2000.28 - 2004.96] system and work towards impacting that
[2003.32 - 2006.52] but it's always holistic because here
[2004.96 - 2009.56] the idea is not with the body it goes
[2006.52 - 2011.64] beyond that so even if let's say we do a
[2009.56 - 2013.36] practice called yoga namaskar which is
[2011.64 - 2014.68] great for the spine but you will see
[2013.36 - 2017.20] overall you'll see a very good bowel
[2014.68 - 2018.76] movement with that as well so for me to
[2017.20 - 2021.04] pinpoint and say that a particular
[2018.76 - 2023.44] practice will cause a certain benefit
[2021.04 - 2026.16] would be incorrect but in terms of the
[2023.44 - 2028.40] food aspect um the first thing is the
[2026.16 - 2030.88] classic warm water with nimbu or with
[2028.40 - 2033.24] lemon it helps to flush out the toxins
[2030.88 - 2035.80] from the kidney that's the first the
[2033.24 - 2038.28] second would be the fenugreek and the
[2035.80 - 2041.44] jira water so this is an Aur
[2038.28 - 2044.96] tip uh here we take about say 1 teaspoon
[2041.44 - 2047.04] of fenri half teaspoon of jira and you
[2044.96 - 2048.96] soak it in water overnight let's say 150
[2047.04 - 2050.84] to 200 mL of water overnight in the
[2048.96 - 2052.88] morning you SE out the seeds and you
[2050.84 - 2054.32] drink that very good for diabetics as
[2052.88 - 2057.04] well because it controls the sugar
[2054.32 - 2058.04] levels this is a great detox drink
[2057.04 - 2059.16] however if you're doing the yoga
[2058.04 - 2060.56] practice then you ensure that you're
[2059.16 - 2061.76] consuming this one and a half hours
[2060.56 - 2064.24] before the yoga
[2061.76 - 2065.44] practice 1 and a half hour before before
[2064.24 - 2067.00] if you're not doing the yoga practice
[2065.44 - 2070.64] you can consume it immediately so if
[2067.00 - 2072.76] somebody gets up yeah Evacuate the bows
[2070.64 - 2075.16] has a cold
[2072.76 - 2076.24] shower drink the water then wake I would
[2075.16 - 2077.92] say drink the water because it also
[2076.24 - 2079.68] helps with the peristaltic movements got
[2077.92 - 2081.44] it got it but I then I still need to
[2079.68 - 2083.80] wait for one and a half hour so if I
[2081.44 - 2085.68] want to do my yoga practice at 6:00 in
[2083.80 - 2086.96] the morning I got to be getting up at
[2085.68 - 2089.44] around 4:00 a.m. in the morning 4:00
[2086.96 - 2091.12] a.m. which is why for yoga practitioners
[2089.44 - 2092.76] we don't even suggest these we say have
[2091.12 - 2094.52] your warm water lace it with a little
[2092.76 - 2096.40] bit of Honey because you need that for
[2094.52 - 2097.80] cellular recharge and to create
[2096.40 - 2099.52] flexibility in the muscles and then you
[2097.80 - 2100.84] leave no Gap at all because you've just
[2099.52 - 2102.24] laced your drink with a little bit of
[2100.84 - 2104.52] Honey which means you haven't disrupted
[2102.24 - 2106.56] the empty stomach condition mhm and then
[2104.52 - 2108.00] you have we take about one if you if you
[2106.56 - 2109.52] get ne leaves we say you have the neem
[2108.00 - 2111.28] leaves seven or eight neem leaves with
[2109.52 - 2113.28] one ball of turmeric so it helps to
[2111.28 - 2115.00] cleanse the colon again the digestive
[2113.28 - 2119.24] system and then you start your yoga
[2115.00 - 2122.88] practice immediately awesome awesome
[2119.24 - 2124.80] um I've been plagued by a cough I've
[2122.88 - 2128.16] tried everything possible for the last
[2124.80 - 2130.68] one month my favorites are Tuli my it is
[2128.16 - 2131.56] manuka honey which has an antibiotic in
[2130.68 - 2136.20] it
[2131.56 - 2138.44] naturally um jamun honey uh two a lot of
[2136.20 - 2142.08] warm water a lot of green teas a lot of
[2138.44 - 2143.96] K and all but before you came on my team
[2142.08 - 2145.84] gave me this and it's like there are
[2143.96 - 2148.64] there stuff in yoga and Avea that you
[2145.84 - 2151.52] can do so what's the tip master that you
[2148.64 - 2153.36] can give me in terms of getting cough
[2151.52 - 2155.12] colds fevers and everybody out there
[2153.36 - 2158.40] suffering from these coughs and cold
[2155.12 - 2161.16] what's our ancient wisdom in and yogic
[2158.40 - 2163.08] practice have to say a without a doubt
[2161.16 - 2164.68] it has to be a yogic practice in your
[2163.08 - 2166.88] life every single
[2164.68 - 2169.80] day I had acute
[2166.88 - 2171.84] bronchitis as a child growing up and I
[2169.80 - 2174.20] used to have this fitis which is you
[2171.84 - 2176.16] know the the certain things inflammation
[2174.20 - 2178.52] and then you know the throat paining and
[2176.16 - 2179.64] every were your tons removed no they
[2178.52 - 2181.56] weren't remove which is why I was put
[2179.64 - 2183.64] into swimming actually on the behest of
[2181.56 - 2185.12] a doctor but nonetheless after I left
[2183.64 - 2187.16] swimming and after I began working I
[2185.12 - 2189.48] used to frequently have sore throat and
[2187.16 - 2192.56] this part always remained very uh
[2189.48 - 2194.48] vulnerable 2017 is when I started yoga I
[2192.56 - 2197.12] haven't looked back I've not had a about
[2194.48 - 2199.12] of fever I think in the last 67 years
[2197.12 - 2201.40] and maybe the only time I fell down was
[2199.12 - 2204.44] when I took the vaccine maybe matter of
[2201.40 - 2206.00] few hours and I sweat it out I recently
[2204.44 - 2208.60] went skiing when I was at a retreat
[2206.00 - 2210.28] doing a retreat in Kashmir and uh I
[2208.60 - 2212.60] experienced this for a brief period of
[2210.28 - 2215.08] time I just had some warm water next day
[2212.60 - 2217.08] I did my Shakti Chala I was fine you did
[2215.08 - 2219.32] your Shakti Chala now that's a form of
[2217.08 - 2221.76] pranay which I recommend to individuals
[2219.32 - 2224.80] particularly who have a very sensitive
[2221.76 - 2226.72] how is that to teach to a person uh it
[2224.80 - 2228.16] is a residential program so firstly
[2226.72 - 2229.92] these programs don't happen online
[2228.16 - 2232.88] because you manipulate someone's Energy
[2229.92 - 2234.84] System so if you're if I'm teaching
[2232.88 - 2236.84] something online and if you go or I with
[2234.84 - 2239.40] the instruction then anything which is
[2236.84 - 2240.96] powerful is always subtle so it could
[2239.40 - 2242.68] create well-being or it could create ill
[2240.96 - 2244.16] beinging so one thing that I always tell
[2242.68 - 2245.76] individuals is don't try to read a book
[2244.16 - 2248.12] and do yoga don't try to watch something
[2245.76 - 2249.88] and do yoga get initiated into it if I
[2248.12 - 2251.64] had to learn this in a residential
[2249.88 - 2253.36] program how much time would it take this
[2251.64 - 2255.08] would take about 4 days and this happens
[2253.36 - 2256.96] at the ISA foundation so even I'm not
[2255.08 - 2259.16] trained to teach that it the certain
[2256.96 - 2261.84] teachers the name of that again it's
[2259.16 - 2264.32] called the shaki chal Kaa and for the
[2261.84 - 2265.44] uninitiated like me out there what does
[2264.32 - 2267.40] it
[2265.44 - 2269.72] involve you must have heard of things
[2267.40 - 2272.12] like the kapalabhati for example and
[2269.72 - 2274.28] various others I don't have the correct
[2272.12 - 2276.36] jargon for that but there are steps so
[2274.28 - 2279.64] it's about a 40 to a 60 Minute process
[2276.36 - 2281.52] that you do but it's a complete practice
[2279.64 - 2283.88] in itself I'm a huge believer because
[2281.52 - 2287.44] currently the Wim Hof method it's very
[2283.88 - 2289.28] famous breath work scientist who has
[2287.44 - 2293.20] challenged Medical Science by them
[2289.28 - 2295.68] inserting every possible virus into him
[2293.20 - 2298.08] and all he did was use breath work he's
[2295.68 - 2302.16] a deep sea diver holds his breath like
[2298.08 - 2304.72] for five or six minutes and um he's able
[2302.16 - 2309.20] to defeat every possible virus and
[2304.72 - 2311.68] so there is s ific truth in breath work
[2309.20 - 2316.08] and I'm going to be doing this
[2311.68 - 2318.64] shortly if you had to summarize our our
[2316.08 - 2320.68] learning and our time together what are
[2318.64 - 2323.12] three things that you would advise me to
[2320.68 - 2325.96] do as an individual you got only three
[2323.12 - 2327.48] things to give me as a gift and you got
[2325.96 - 2330.40] only three things to give my listeners
[2327.48 - 2332.76] as a gift you are schloka the yogic
[2330.40 - 2334.28] practitioner the yogic nutritionist what
[2332.76 - 2336.00] are those three things that you would
[2334.28 - 2338.24] give away it's like we stuck on an
[2336.00 - 2341.56] island and we can't get anything else
[2338.24 - 2341.56] from you except these three
[2342.12 - 2347.04] gifts involvement with
[2344.56 - 2348.84] life okay learning to keep your likes
[2347.04 - 2350.52] and dislikes aside I think they go
[2348.84 - 2351.84] together because I can only be involved
[2350.52 - 2354.76] with something if I keep my likes and
[2351.84 - 2356.36] dislikes aside otherwise if I like
[2354.76 - 2357.84] something I'll be involved if I dislike
[2356.36 - 2360.32] something I will not be involved so
[2357.84 - 2362.92] tread the path of
[2360.32 - 2364.44] neutrality I would say involvement not
[2362.92 - 2367.20] even neutrality because again there a
[2364.44 - 2368.76] there's a bias there okay uh just throw
[2367.20 - 2371.76] your yourself and whatever lies in front
[2368.76 - 2374.16] of you right now 100% just that's karma
[2371.76 - 2376.52] yoga for you any task that I have at
[2374.16 - 2378.92] hand right now this can be yoga I'm
[2376.52 - 2380.48] doing sadhana right now if I'm 100%
[2378.92 - 2383.56] involved with you I'm throwing myself in
[2380.48 - 2387.92] this work that is number
[2383.56 - 2389.64] one number two would be to have to bring
[2387.92 - 2395.60] in some kind
[2389.64 - 2395.60] of a yoga practice in your life very
[2395.68 - 2399.84] important and the stems from the fact
[2398.48 - 2401.32] that this is not just your physical
[2399.84 - 2404.80] health all of that is a byproduct of
[2401.32 - 2406.00] yoga back I've had people surgery dates
[2404.80 - 2407.76] have been booked they've walked out of
[2406.00 - 2409.40] the need forever people have dropped
[2407.76 - 2411.28] their medications hypertensive
[2409.40 - 2413.84] medications in the retreat in the 4-day
[2411.28 - 2415.16] 5day retreat thyroid medications all of
[2413.84 - 2418.04] that will
[2415.16 - 2421.20] happen but the idea behind yoga is that
[2418.04 - 2423.00] you are not just functioning here as a
[2421.20 - 2424.44] piece of creation you're not like the
[2423.00 - 2428.68] any you're not like this plant you're
[2424.44 - 2430.68] not like any other dog on the street
[2428.68 - 2432.36] you can become the Creator himself you
[2430.68 - 2434.56] can become a master of your destiny
[2432.36 - 2437.04] because now you have a hold over your
[2434.56 - 2440.12] innermost core which is the maker of
[2437.04 - 2443.76] life so for example in in we say this
[2440.12 - 2445.64] that um anytime you go to an astrologer
[2443.76 - 2448.00] You Know M Kali this is my chart now you
[2445.64 - 2449.36] predict and if the astrologer knows a
[2448.00 - 2451.08] good astrologer if they know you're a
[2449.36 - 2453.04] yogi they will never predict you because
[2451.08 - 2454.60] they know you have taken charge of your
[2453.04 - 2456.76] own life so those stars and planets
[2454.60 - 2458.44] don't make a difference in your life so
[2456.76 - 2462.16] why won't you want to spend those 45
[2458.44 - 2465.20] minutes or 1 hour every day in
[2462.16 - 2467.44] this powerful words very very powerful
[2465.20 - 2469.72] words thank you so much Loca for your
[2467.44 - 2474.16] wisdom today it a pleasure hosting you
[2469.72 - 2474.16] today on thank you so much likewise
