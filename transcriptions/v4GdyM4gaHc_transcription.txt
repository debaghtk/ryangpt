[9.54 - 14.16] has a presentation we will uh have Ryan
[12.12 - 16.80] walk us through that and then there's a
[14.16 - 19.32] set of questions that I'll ask Ryan and
[16.80 - 22.02] if you have any questions you can uh
[19.32 - 26.12] feel free to put it up in the chat or we
[22.02 - 26.12] will have a q a session towards the end
[26.22 - 30.36] um thank you so much thank you garima
[28.74 - 32.04] thank you everyone for joining in on a
[30.36 - 33.78] Saturday
[32.04 - 35.88] um
[33.78 - 37.80] promise to add value to all of you here
[35.88 - 39.72] today in the seminar
[37.80 - 42.72] um I'm going to share my screen I I love
[39.72 - 44.46] to I would love to start with this first
[42.72 - 47.04] slide
[44.46 - 49.08] um shweta is my screen sharing yes it is
[47.04 - 52.38] you lived in Bangalore you probably know
[49.08 - 53.82] that this is UB City uh the malayata is
[52.38 - 55.38] there in the background and it's
[53.82 - 58.68] probably the most expensive real estate
[55.38 - 60.54] in Bangalore yeah I recently discovered
[58.68 - 62.34] Hong Kong is the most expensive real
[60.54 - 63.78] estate in the world we did a Google app
[62.34 - 67.38] for it
[63.78 - 70.20] and and I want to place this to anyone
[67.38 - 72.18] watching in or listening in the most
[70.20 - 76.50] expensive real estate
[72.18 - 79.74] uh is you ever thought about that
[76.50 - 82.20] I recently bought my home in Bangalore
[79.74 - 84.60] and after I bought it I was like yeah
[82.20 - 86.94] it's a second-hand home but
[84.60 - 88.44] I'm gonna do up the walls I'm gonna do
[86.94 - 90.18] up the floor I'm going to do up the
[88.44 - 92.88] bathroom and then
[90.18 - 94.68] as I was scrubbing some of the TAPS in
[92.88 - 96.36] the bathroom you know where at the
[94.68 - 97.92] bottom of the Basin like I was cleaning
[96.36 - 100.32] another houses mine I want to clean it
[97.92 - 102.54] so imagine that's your human body and
[100.32 - 104.46] you actually owned your body and now
[102.54 - 106.92] your liver had to be cleaned up your
[104.46 - 108.90] cartilage had to be cleaned up so most
[106.92 - 111.48] of us go through life with this thought
[108.90 - 114.12] process our body is somebody else we are
[111.48 - 116.10] tenants in it think about it
[114.12 - 117.90] are you the really the landlord of your
[116.10 - 118.74] body and if you're the landlord of your
[117.90 - 120.96] body
[118.74 - 123.62] you will not
[120.96 - 123.62] Miss
[131.10 - 134.84] I think it's Ryan's Network
[142.50 - 147.20] shweta has my presentation stopped
[144.84 - 149.52] because my screen has frozen
[147.20 - 150.84] we can hear you now
[149.52 - 153.72] okay
[150.84 - 156.36] um okay you can hear me
[153.72 - 158.70] so so basically the the whole idea over
[156.36 - 161.46] here is to start everyone on this
[158.70 - 164.52] process which is
[161.46 - 167.76] whatever you spend your money on
[164.52 - 171.12] I would like to convince you that spend
[167.76 - 173.04] a little bit lesser on your house a
[171.12 - 175.14] little bit lesser on your Gucci bag a
[173.04 - 177.90] little bit lesser on your A6 running
[175.14 - 180.78] shoes a little bit lesser on your
[177.90 - 183.06] Maldives trip and a little bit more on
[180.78 - 187.44] the food that you eat
[183.06 - 190.10] what you put into you is the equivalent
[187.44 - 193.20] of me thinking about putting Italian
[190.10 - 195.12] versus putting vitrified tiles
[193.20 - 197.16] and it's now my own house that I bought
[195.12 - 200.16] so I'm thinking should I should I not oh
[197.16 - 202.98] it's like 150 rupees more expensive per
[200.16 - 205.92] square foot and the same logic does it
[202.98 - 208.74] apply to your body so most Runners that
[205.92 - 210.72] I have met in my life do Nam give us
[208.74 - 213.84] their nutrition they use they use
[210.72 - 216.60] running as the nutritional stick or
[213.84 - 217.92] latte or discipline to get you to the
[216.60 - 223.08] next level
[217.92 - 226.02] so you know from a perspective
[223.08 - 230.42] just a moment from a perspective where
[226.02 - 230.42] you want to be working
[230.52 - 235.08] the screen has frozen just a moment can
[233.58 - 236.46] you hear me because my laptop is
[235.08 - 239.04] completely Frozen and I don't know if
[236.46 - 239.70] it's with the zoom we can hear you but I
[239.04 - 241.82] think
[239.70 - 241.82] um
[242.24 - 247.20] stop sharing and share again maybe yeah
[244.80 - 249.50] I'm just stopping sharing uh just a
[247.20 - 249.50] moment
[266.12 - 272.16] Murphy's law says things will hang when
[268.56 - 274.26] you want it to not hang so my screen is
[272.16 - 276.38] completely Frozen
[274.26 - 276.38] um
[276.50 - 280.62] the logic now the logic now is to
[279.00 - 282.06] completely reboot the laptop which will
[280.62 - 285.08] take me about a minute and a half to
[282.06 - 287.88] come back no what you could do is
[285.08 - 290.28] you could please mail it to shweta and
[287.88 - 293.76] she could display it or yeah you might
[290.28 - 295.74] have an email ID now the problem is my
[293.76 - 297.72] screen has completely Frozen everything
[295.74 - 299.36] is Frozen everything is frozen it is
[297.72 - 301.86] never done that it's enough
[299.36 - 303.48] so we can wait till you come back that's
[301.86 - 305.16] just just a moment just a moment I'm
[303.48 - 308.46] seeing if I can end the task I'll just
[305.16 - 310.50] I'll just come back on this okay sure
[308.46 - 313.52] sorry guys
[310.50 - 313.52] okay slow
[331.02 - 337.32] Ryan you want to whatever your
[334.14 - 338.88] whatever you do or whatever you own if I
[337.32 - 340.50] can just leave you with the first
[338.88 - 343.64] thought and the only thought of today
[340.50 - 343.64] which is
[343.80 - 348.06] what's the brand of your body so I
[346.26 - 350.46] believe I'm a Rolls-Royce
[348.06 - 352.16] so I would ask vinod I would ask Rama I
[350.46 - 356.28] would ask Amber I would ask Jay
[352.16 - 358.38] whoever's in here Praveen done my what
[356.28 - 362.52] brand are you and think of your body as
[358.38 - 366.48] a vehicle or something very elite
[362.52 - 368.46] and the act of eating uh is the raw
[366.48 - 370.14] material to build this real estate to
[368.46 - 372.18] maintain this real estate to preserve
[370.14 - 373.80] this is
[372.18 - 376.56] so
[373.80 - 378.66] so from from that from that perspective
[376.56 - 381.12] let me start off with two three things
[378.66 - 382.68] there's something known as shelf life of
[381.12 - 384.78] every cell
[382.68 - 387.18] the only thing that you don't change in
[384.78 - 389.40] your entire body is your eyes
[387.18 - 392.10] everything else turns over turns over
[389.40 - 394.14] means uh like for example the hair on my
[392.10 - 396.84] head is not the same when I was 10 years
[394.14 - 399.66] younger every seven months you change a
[396.84 - 402.06] hair follicle so to produce
[399.66 - 404.04] the hair follicle and the hair that
[402.06 - 406.62] comes out from your hair follicle it is
[404.04 - 409.32] the nutrition that goes into you
[406.62 - 413.22] so as a sports nutritionist when I am
[409.32 - 415.44] called upon to produce an Olympic level
[413.22 - 417.00] performance or somebody goes for the MDS
[415.44 - 419.28] somebody goes for the marathon subless
[417.00 - 421.62] they want performance they want run time
[419.28 - 423.60] we are looking at the structure of the
[421.62 - 425.94] cell but it's like you've given me a
[423.60 - 429.48] house and you've called me as an
[425.94 - 433.86] interior decorator to make your internal
[429.48 - 436.44] rooms look better shine more run faster
[433.86 - 438.54] but what I would like in today's seminar
[436.44 - 441.72] because I see a lot of gray hair like me
[438.54 - 444.72] in this presentation uh which is these
[441.72 - 446.16] are the Masters and above older Runners
[444.72 - 447.78] which means you want to run till you're
[446.16 - 450.66] 70 years of age
[447.78 - 453.66] but how do you not have this real estate
[450.66 - 455.94] breakdown so now you don't contract a
[453.66 - 458.16] sports nutritionist to do the interior
[455.94 - 460.44] decoration but you come in and say I
[458.16 - 463.92] need an architect
[460.44 - 467.76] I need an architect because I know that
[463.92 - 470.28] every 14 years 14 years 14 years I turn
[467.76 - 474.24] over my muscle cell and every eight
[470.28 - 476.04] years I turn over my uh fat cells my
[474.24 - 478.44] blood cells is four months my brain
[476.04 - 479.88] cells almost never turn over my neurons
[478.44 - 482.46] never turn over
[479.88 - 485.04] so when I present this picture to you
[482.46 - 486.66] it's not about it's not about do you
[485.04 - 490.74] follow a diet
[486.66 - 493.26] it's about how aware are you about the
[490.74 - 496.68] science of what you put into your body
[493.26 - 498.36] so having said that there are two three
[496.68 - 499.86] things that I would love for you to do
[498.36 - 501.96] one
[499.86 - 503.46] if money is not an issue and it should
[501.96 - 505.38] not be an issue because your real estate
[503.46 - 507.90] is the most expensive real estate on the
[505.38 - 509.52] planet if you own a house that's one two
[507.90 - 512.46] three crores
[509.52 - 513.66] and you have not done a genetic test or
[512.46 - 516.54] blood test
[513.66 - 519.54] then you're living in a slum
[516.54 - 522.12] think about it you have never invested
[519.54 - 523.68] as much on the science yeah you're
[522.12 - 525.72] buying you're doing personal best you're
[523.68 - 528.48] running for the fun of it but my logic
[525.72 - 530.58] to you is have you seen 50 years ahead I
[528.48 - 532.38] have because I have an 88 year old
[530.58 - 534.48] marathon runner who comes to me and says
[532.38 - 537.62] I wish I had done this nutrition when I
[534.48 - 541.14] was 50. so that I wouldn't have
[537.62 - 543.18] catastrophically damaged the turnover of
[541.14 - 544.62] that room inside of my body it could be
[543.18 - 546.18] the liver it could be the heart it could
[544.62 - 547.68] be the kidneys it could be the pancreas
[546.18 - 549.60] it could be the muscle it could be the
[547.68 - 550.80] cartilage it could be
[549.60 - 553.74] um the bones
[550.80 - 556.10] for example a lot of women do not know
[553.74 - 560.04] that they have the osteoporosis or the
[556.10 - 561.72] osteoarthritis Gene what is gene Gene is
[560.04 - 562.98] the software code in the human body that
[561.72 - 564.42] you inherited from your mother and
[562.98 - 567.60] father
[564.42 - 570.36] so I would love for you to understand
[567.60 - 573.60] in the software code are you thumbs up
[570.36 - 576.90] or you thumbs down for example I have a
[573.60 - 579.60] magnesium Gene that is thumbs down
[576.90 - 581.88] so I cram very easily in my carbs but
[579.60 - 584.16] the moment I take a magnesium supplement
[581.88 - 585.90] on a daily basis
[584.16 - 587.22] now Puritan would say no no you
[585.90 - 589.62] shouldn't take a supplement on a daily
[587.22 - 591.36] basis but I do know that my Gene is a
[589.62 - 593.28] thumbs down therefore I need to take a
[591.36 - 595.80] magnesium supplement to prevent crime
[593.28 - 596.70] cramping so I can do my karate class
[595.80 - 599.16] foreign
[596.70 - 601.02] so my logic to everyone out here is if
[599.16 - 604.20] you do a nutrition Gene test and a
[601.02 - 606.72] fitness Gene test you get an astrology
[604.20 - 609.06] or a crystal ball gazing into your
[606.72 - 610.92] future and that's how I work as a
[609.06 - 612.54] magician so people are like oh yeah
[610.92 - 614.46] Ryan's given me this time and all I'm
[612.54 - 617.16] not giving you any timing I've just gone
[614.46 - 620.22] in and understood your architectural
[617.16 - 622.26] blueprint which is the blood test
[620.22 - 625.32] and which is the genetic test now once
[622.26 - 626.76] you get that then we get into who are
[625.32 - 627.60] the people going in and out of this
[626.76 - 629.16] building
[627.60 - 630.90] which the building is you if you haven't
[629.16 - 632.46] got the synonym by now
[630.90 - 634.80] and how are you feeding this building
[632.46 - 637.26] what are the choices of food when are
[634.80 - 639.12] you putting it what is the timing is
[637.26 - 641.76] there any science behind the logic of
[639.12 - 644.64] you putting in a banana before a run or
[641.76 - 647.04] you're doing a fasted State training
[644.64 - 649.34] let me tell you in 25 years of doing
[647.04 - 649.34] this
[649.58 - 654.84] no two people are the same including you
[653.10 - 656.10] get brother and sister or brother and
[654.84 - 658.26] brother or sister and sister in the same
[656.10 - 661.02] family there is a genetic diversity
[658.26 - 664.50] except in identical twins
[661.02 - 667.68] the genetic diversity results
[664.50 - 668.82] in you making better or worse food
[667.68 - 670.74] choices
[668.82 - 673.44] and so when shweta said at the beginning
[670.74 - 675.60] of this lecture that Ryan wherever I am
[673.44 - 677.46] I call him up he says you can eat it but
[675.60 - 679.80] those four five Riders are me
[677.46 - 683.10] remembering what are the gene sets in
[679.80 - 684.86] her and I don't say no but I ask is that
[683.10 - 687.54] something that you want to be doing
[684.86 - 689.34] given the fact that you know what is a
[687.54 - 691.38] front foot for you and what is a back
[689.34 - 693.30] foot for you front foot meaning the
[691.38 - 695.64] genes working for you back foot means
[693.30 - 697.98] the gene is not working for you
[695.64 - 699.90] um so so from this perspective I wanted
[697.98 - 702.42] to talk about just your real estate
[699.90 - 704.34] being the most expensive thing so shweta
[702.42 - 706.14] what I will do is I will take the
[704.34 - 708.66] questions because it'll be better for
[706.14 - 710.70] people to in this session to get their
[708.66 - 712.50] questions and queries answered so we
[710.70 - 714.96] would have the next 45 minutes just to
[712.50 - 717.62] go and Rapid Fire and get the questions
[714.96 - 717.62] answered
[718.50 - 723.12] perfect okay
[720.14 - 726.54] so we'll start with I think the very
[723.12 - 729.78] very basic question of this whole macro
[726.54 - 730.98] and micro which uh you know a lot of
[729.78 - 732.66] people have a lot of questions about
[730.98 - 735.00] them what are the macros how important
[732.66 - 738.48] they are what are the micros how do we
[735.00 - 742.22] uh you know and maybe some food examples
[738.48 - 748.22] that uh fall into each of the categories
[742.22 - 751.08] and uh you know its role in in the sport
[748.22 - 754.14] explaining macro and micro uh with some
[751.08 - 755.40] examples and and the role in place
[754.14 - 758.22] so
[755.40 - 762.86] let me uh I'm just seeing if I can open
[758.22 - 762.86] that that one slide that I created
[764.88 - 767.78] just give me a second
[770.88 - 774.26] yeah I got it
[775.80 - 782.46] Okay so macro and micro Greek words
[779.10 - 783.18] macro means large micro means small
[782.46 - 785.58] um
[783.18 - 789.18] imagine your body has three fuel sources
[785.58 - 791.40] you're a car you get you get petrol you
[789.18 - 794.64] get diesel and you get Electric
[791.40 - 796.98] so you got protein carbs and fat
[794.64 - 799.56] depending on your genetic predisposition
[796.98 - 802.10] some of us are amazing carb burners some
[799.56 - 806.64] of us are amazing fat burners
[802.10 - 808.62] and some line between the protein is the
[806.64 - 810.48] building block the protein is the macro
[808.62 - 812.52] the carb is the macro the fat is the
[810.48 - 814.50] macro macro means it gives the calorie
[812.52 - 816.84] content we is nutritionist when we plan
[814.50 - 819.60] A nutrition plan
[816.84 - 821.88] you know people think oh just do Italy
[819.60 - 823.44] to those are two Paratha two Biryani you
[821.88 - 824.94] know and that's it's very general I can
[823.44 - 827.22] do this myself
[824.94 - 829.80] but from an Olympic level perspective
[827.22 - 831.72] let me tell you when we work with boxers
[829.80 - 833.58] when we work with Taekwondo when we work
[831.72 - 834.78] with wrestlers which is way to manage
[833.58 - 839.64] Sports
[834.78 - 842.46] I can get a boxer to 60 kgs one day
[839.64 - 844.86] uh before the boxing finals when the
[842.46 - 846.42] actual body weight is 72 kgs I did that
[844.86 - 848.70] with sushil Kumar I've done it with half
[846.42 - 850.38] a dozen boxes it doesn't it cannot be
[848.70 - 852.48] done overnight but it can be done over a
[850.38 - 854.52] six to eight week period
[852.48 - 857.04] and you do that by controlling your
[854.52 - 858.84] Macros your protein your carbs and your
[857.04 - 861.12] fats so as a runner these are your fuel
[858.84 - 863.40] sources I can't give you a generic
[861.12 - 866.34] statement but I can tell you as a runner
[863.40 - 869.58] if you have crossed the age of 50 aim to
[866.34 - 873.42] get 1.5 grams per kg body weight of
[869.58 - 875.64] protein so let's say Mr vinod is 72 kgs
[873.42 - 878.58] or 73 kgs
[875.64 - 882.84] um I would give Mr vinod 72 into 1 which
[878.58 - 884.64] is 73.5 is half of 70 35 about 100 to
[882.84 - 886.68] 105 grams of protein now with the
[884.64 - 888.24] vegetarian or non-vegetarian I have a
[886.68 - 891.48] discussion with the client in terms of
[888.24 - 893.58] what is their dietary preference then I
[891.48 - 895.92] go after the food sources to build it
[893.58 - 898.20] into his program now if a said
[895.92 - 901.08] individual has too much of body fat
[898.20 - 903.12] percentage on their body
[901.08 - 904.92] okay I call them the petrol tanks so the
[903.12 - 906.96] fuel tanks around your waist or your hip
[904.92 - 909.12] or your bum which is most of the places
[906.96 - 910.86] where we store our fat reserves those
[909.12 - 911.88] could be tanks which could help you in
[910.86 - 913.68] running
[911.88 - 915.06] provided you know how to tweak your
[913.68 - 917.22] carbohydrate down or tweak your
[915.06 - 919.92] carbohydrate up so sounds little bit
[917.22 - 923.22] confusing let me see if my screen shares
[919.92 - 926.94] oh so Ryan uh question on that is you
[923.22 - 930.54] said 73 grams of protein yes so how much
[926.94 - 932.46] protein should one intake uh in terms of
[930.54 - 934.56] broadly between veg and non-veg to get
[932.46 - 937.02] that much of protein because uh
[934.56 - 940.98] so so normally when we work it's like
[937.02 - 943.86] this okay again it was 73 kg man would
[940.98 - 946.20] require 1.5 if it's a 50 kg woman she'd
[943.86 - 950.16] require 75 grams of protein because it's
[946.20 - 952.02] 1.5 into 50 kgs 75 grams of protein now
[950.16 - 954.48] how we do it is it's a very simple
[952.02 - 956.88] equation wherein how many meals a day
[954.48 - 959.22] would you eat so if you eat five meals a
[956.88 - 962.04] day divide by five or three major meals
[959.22 - 963.54] divide by three and keep two or two
[962.04 - 965.16] small meals which is your pre-workout
[963.54 - 967.14] and post workout snackers two small
[965.16 - 970.62] meals and call that a major meal so four
[967.14 - 975.66] so 75 divided by 4 which is roughly 20
[970.62 - 977.10] sorry 20 grams a per meat so shweta what
[975.66 - 980.10] I would do is then I would split that 20
[977.10 - 982.02] grams per meal now if I'm a vegetarian I
[980.10 - 984.42] would look at what food sources would
[982.02 - 987.30] give me 25 grams of protein so is it 100
[984.42 - 990.72] grams as a cup of beans that I need to
[987.30 - 993.60] eat or is it multiple some beans some
[990.72 - 995.64] Dal some soy or some paneer or some curd
[993.60 - 997.32] or a glass of milk so put that as a
[995.64 - 998.58] vegetarian sauce if it's a non-wet
[997.32 - 999.96] source like this morning I had my
[998.58 - 1001.76] non-veg breakfast I was looking at
[999.96 - 1004.58] everything oh okay I'm doing five with
[1001.76 - 1006.08] the pumps I'm doing uh two eggs so the
[1004.58 - 1007.88] two eggs are 12 grams of protein the
[1006.08 - 1009.98] water pump has about
[1007.88 - 1012.50] um 10 grams of protein in that total
[1009.98 - 1014.42] because more Dal can then uh yeah 25
[1012.50 - 1016.10] grams oh yeah I'm covered oh wow I
[1014.42 - 1018.38] forgot up my baked beans to reduce my
[1016.10 - 1020.54] cholesterol so I do a whole cup of baked
[1018.38 - 1022.40] beans and then there was a salmon fish
[1020.54 - 1024.32] and I looked at it and I was like I'm
[1022.40 - 1025.94] already full though South Indian
[1024.32 - 1028.04] breakfast on Saturday was just too much
[1025.94 - 1030.56] so I was like okay not eating the salmon
[1028.04 - 1032.36] salmon alone was about 120 grams weight
[1030.56 - 1033.98] which would have given me another 30
[1032.36 - 1036.38] grams of protein
[1033.98 - 1037.94] so I think if you start breaking down
[1036.38 - 1040.04] your Macros that way in looking at the
[1037.94 - 1043.52] protein content then you go to the
[1040.04 - 1046.10] carbohydrate content now most Delight
[1043.52 - 1049.52] Runners have a very good fat percentage
[1046.10 - 1053.12] so shweta like I make you go in
[1049.52 - 1054.68] continuously to get a body composition
[1053.12 - 1058.28] assessment done
[1054.68 - 1061.04] I I wish to ask this group how many of
[1058.28 - 1062.78] you and and maybe just let me know in
[1061.04 - 1065.72] the chat box
[1062.78 - 1067.28] um you know um how many of the chat box
[1065.72 - 1068.90] would
[1067.28 - 1071.24] um
[1068.90 - 1074.30] have done the body composition so just
[1071.24 - 1076.94] type in yes or no just just to have uh
[1074.30 - 1078.80] just to have a basic understanding of
[1076.94 - 1080.54] how many of you have done a body
[1078.80 - 1083.12] composition and in the body composition
[1080.54 - 1085.52] very good I'm getting many many yeses
[1083.12 - 1089.54] you need to know your fat composition
[1085.52 - 1091.82] your visceral fat and your muscle mass
[1089.54 - 1094.10] okay now once you have this information
[1091.82 - 1095.84] it's like saying I know how many
[1094.10 - 1097.28] bedrooms are there in my house I know
[1095.84 - 1099.32] how many kitchens are there how many
[1097.28 - 1102.20] Halls are there I mean kitchens and
[1099.32 - 1104.30] Halls is like if you're uh a billionaire
[1102.20 - 1105.98] in this audience but you get my gist
[1104.30 - 1109.34] right you need to know what's the con
[1105.98 - 1112.22] construct now when a person specifically
[1109.34 - 1114.68] a man has more than 25 percent body fat
[1112.22 - 1116.96] I'd like to bring it down if a woman has
[1114.68 - 1119.18] more than 30 body fat I'd like to bring
[1116.96 - 1122.06] it down women ideally speaking child
[1119.18 - 1123.56] bearing face should be 25 to 30 if
[1122.06 - 1125.78] you're not looking to have children 20
[1123.56 - 1129.80] to 25 percent is a great fat percentage
[1125.78 - 1131.00] below 20 you're a rock star men below 15
[1129.80 - 1131.96] percent
[1131.00 - 1133.76] um
[1131.96 - 1138.56] you don't need to come to a nutritionist
[1133.76 - 1141.08] okay uh 15 to 25 work on it
[1138.56 - 1142.88] um and that's where I would say do the
[1141.08 - 1145.16] body composition to then begin to
[1142.88 - 1149.06] understand how to feed your Macros so if
[1145.16 - 1153.02] I were to put the bricks on carbohydrate
[1149.06 - 1157.46] as a marathon runner we can use protein
[1153.02 - 1160.52] amino acids and uh uh things like
[1157.46 - 1162.50] L-Carnitine or B complex to go and Latte
[1160.52 - 1163.76] the fat out of your body
[1162.50 - 1166.10] okay
[1163.76 - 1167.60] um so so it's I can't do it in a 45
[1166.10 - 1169.16] minute lecture it's like a six hour
[1167.60 - 1170.66] Workshop that I actually found a
[1169.16 - 1173.78] runner's Workshop that I did for six
[1170.66 - 1175.04] hours and I took us at the slide that
[1173.78 - 1178.04] you're seeing is one of the slides from
[1175.04 - 1179.66] that six hour Workshop so
[1178.04 - 1181.10] that will be the macros and then you
[1179.66 - 1183.44] come to the micros micros are your
[1181.10 - 1186.08] vitamins and minerals
[1183.44 - 1189.92] um I'm I'm gonna paste uh I'm gonna
[1186.08 - 1191.84] paste in um a blood test link
[1189.92 - 1194.18] um and those of you do a blood test if
[1191.84 - 1196.16] you click on this link it takes you to a
[1194.18 - 1197.90] page I've constructed which is the
[1196.16 - 1199.34] nutritionist choice of blood test which
[1197.90 - 1201.44] is a general blood test and then you
[1199.34 - 1203.24] have the vitamins and minerals and I
[1201.44 - 1205.70] also have the heavy metals and also I
[1203.24 - 1207.44] have food allergy blood tests if money
[1205.70 - 1209.18] is not an issue get all of them done
[1207.44 - 1211.16] once a year
[1209.18 - 1212.36] the reason being is and let me tell you
[1211.16 - 1214.64] the logic
[1212.36 - 1216.38] the logic is this the general blood test
[1214.64 - 1218.48] the liver the enzyme the kidney enzyme
[1216.38 - 1220.28] you do it twice a year you know if the
[1218.48 - 1223.10] running is damaging your body please
[1220.28 - 1225.50] understand when you run you break down
[1223.10 - 1227.18] cellular structure in you which puts a
[1225.50 - 1229.10] load on your liver and kidney and all
[1227.18 - 1231.32] the detoxification systems in your body
[1229.10 - 1233.30] so if you're not feeding correctly
[1231.32 - 1234.98] you're not born with the right genes to
[1233.30 - 1236.90] recover
[1234.98 - 1238.58] you're actually killing yourself to a
[1236.90 - 1240.44] certain extent you're killing your
[1238.58 - 1241.76] muscle your muscle is damaging too much
[1240.44 - 1244.24] it goes and puts load on liver and
[1241.76 - 1246.98] kidney I have had people in CrossFit
[1244.24 - 1249.32] rhabdolysis which is they Hammer up the
[1246.98 - 1250.46] body so badly that they go into toxic
[1249.32 - 1251.90] mode
[1250.46 - 1253.46] but you don't do that you know you're
[1251.90 - 1255.26] taking rest you're eating well I'm
[1253.46 - 1257.60] assuming that
[1255.26 - 1259.46] so the when you come into the
[1257.60 - 1262.46] micronutrients why did I go to the blood
[1259.46 - 1264.14] test because I genuinely do not take a
[1262.46 - 1266.18] multivitamin
[1264.14 - 1268.16] and let me tell you why I'm the guy that
[1266.18 - 1271.82] launched Amway Nutrilite in India I was
[1268.16 - 1273.62] one of the first employees in 1999 okay
[1271.82 - 1275.36] I worked with them for three years to
[1273.62 - 1277.46] build the neutralite model in India and
[1275.36 - 1279.80] educate people about and Amway deal is
[1277.46 - 1281.84] one of my preferred prescription choices
[1279.80 - 1284.18] in the multivitamin Centrum is their
[1281.84 - 1287.30] first form from the US and my all-time
[1284.18 - 1290.18] favorite shweta knows is trevo it's 174
[1287.30 - 1292.22] fruit and vegetable extract from the US
[1290.18 - 1294.50] you don't get it in India it's a liquid
[1292.22 - 1297.08] multivitamin it's I think it's like the
[1294.50 - 1298.82] Lamborghini of vitamin and minerals you
[1297.08 - 1301.04] can get a bottle of it and start taking
[1298.82 - 1302.30] one or two tablespoons a day covers
[1301.04 - 1304.82] everything that you need but I don't
[1302.30 - 1307.40] take it why because in this link I've
[1304.82 - 1309.80] sent you I do all the vitamin and
[1307.40 - 1312.62] mineral blood test
[1309.80 - 1316.94] and if any one of them go down whether
[1312.62 - 1318.68] my B2 so I keep tracking my B6 and my B9
[1316.94 - 1320.84] and I keep tracking my zinc and
[1318.68 - 1322.58] magnesium because my genetic receptors
[1320.84 - 1323.54] told me that these four don't absorb
[1322.58 - 1325.22] well
[1323.54 - 1326.72] so when I check my blood test and I look
[1325.22 - 1328.52] like oh it's all normal
[1326.72 - 1330.50] do I need to take a multivitamin no
[1328.52 - 1333.20] because I'm eating my food correctly so
[1330.50 - 1334.94] your food the Indian farmer should be
[1333.20 - 1336.68] planting it in correct soil and stuff
[1334.94 - 1339.26] like that and you should be getting the
[1336.68 - 1341.84] micronutrients the bad news is that the
[1339.26 - 1343.94] micronutrients in the soil has come so
[1341.84 - 1346.40] the palak today as compared to the palak
[1343.94 - 1349.88] that my grandmother ate my grandmother
[1346.40 - 1353.06] got a more nutritive micro nutrition in
[1349.88 - 1354.68] the in the vegetables and the fruits as
[1353.06 - 1356.30] compared to what we get today
[1354.68 - 1358.76] so I'm not saying that you need to take
[1356.30 - 1362.42] a supplement I'm saying do the blood
[1358.76 - 1363.74] test be aware how often well if if like
[1362.42 - 1365.00] I have got I've got one of these guys
[1363.74 - 1366.80] who's billionaires money is not an issue
[1365.00 - 1368.24] he does the blood test every month so
[1366.80 - 1370.16] like right I need to know if it goes
[1368.24 - 1372.92] down even by 10 points like if I watch
[1370.16 - 1375.86] the stock market why not my own body
[1372.92 - 1377.54] so I think once a month is like too much
[1375.86 - 1380.96] once a quarter is perfect if you're
[1377.54 - 1382.82] above 50 uh once every six months uh if
[1380.96 - 1385.34] you're a runner have to do it every six
[1382.82 - 1387.08] months uh and if you're not a runner in
[1385.34 - 1388.46] this forum then at least once a year you
[1387.08 - 1390.62] do the blood test if you do the blood
[1388.46 - 1393.92] test shweta can give you
[1390.62 - 1395.72] um my email ID and then I can help you
[1393.92 - 1397.28] um get in touch with a person on my team
[1395.72 - 1400.46] who can guide you that hey this is wrong
[1397.28 - 1402.92] that's wrong but in terms of the micro
[1400.46 - 1404.90] nutrition in Runners my all-time
[1402.92 - 1407.60] favorite is magnesium
[1404.90 - 1410.72] for the men and women
[1407.60 - 1411.62] uh calcium specifically more for the
[1410.72 - 1414.56] women
[1411.62 - 1416.42] after I do a blood test because of
[1414.56 - 1418.70] osteoporosis because as your estrogen
[1416.42 - 1420.44] drops As you move towards menopause your
[1418.70 - 1422.30] bone mineral density drops so when you
[1420.44 - 1425.54] do that dexa scan
[1422.30 - 1428.42] dexa scan I'll just type it up d-e-x-a
[1425.54 - 1430.34] dexa is the gold standard for doing your
[1428.42 - 1432.68] body composition sorry I've jumped from
[1430.34 - 1434.36] blood test to dexa scan why because this
[1432.68 - 1435.74] calcium is in your bone minerals men
[1434.36 - 1437.96] also should do it above the age of 50
[1435.74 - 1439.88] but please do the dexa scan only once
[1437.96 - 1441.86] once a year because it's a radiation CT
[1439.88 - 1443.54] scan once a year don't do it more than
[1441.86 - 1445.16] that other than that you can do the in
[1443.54 - 1447.02] body or like I have this one weighing
[1445.16 - 1448.94] scale over here in my clinic which is
[1447.02 - 1452.00] called the Omron garada scan which gives
[1448.94 - 1456.92] you the overall I'll just type it up for
[1452.00 - 1460.34] everyone Omron garada hbf
[1456.92 - 1461.96] I think it's hbf965 if I'm not mistaken
[1460.34 - 1464.48] or something like that you'll get on
[1461.96 - 1466.58] Amazon 9 900 rupees it gives you four
[1464.48 - 1469.22] measures of the area check of fat in
[1466.58 - 1471.32] your whole body your trunk your arms and
[1469.22 - 1473.24] your legs and the same for muscle whole
[1471.32 - 1475.64] body muscle whole body arms whole body
[1473.24 - 1478.52] trunk whole body legs and visceral fat
[1475.64 - 1480.20] and body age so kind of that when you
[1478.52 - 1482.00] take it on a monthly basis you know your
[1480.20 - 1484.16] body composition you do your blood tests
[1482.00 - 1486.56] every six months you get to know if
[1484.16 - 1488.12] you're feeding the raw materials you're
[1486.56 - 1489.94] giving in the macro and micros are
[1488.12 - 1493.46] really clear
[1489.94 - 1495.56] all over the place and things like
[1493.46 - 1498.14] chromium things like selenium things
[1495.56 - 1500.30] like sod so the minerals of micro is
[1498.14 - 1502.10] sodium and potassium Runners need to be
[1500.30 - 1504.26] very careful on the sodium and potassium
[1502.10 - 1505.94] uh because sometimes they sweat so much
[1504.26 - 1508.10] they lose so much of sodium potassium
[1505.94 - 1511.36] goes to the roof potassium taken in high
[1508.10 - 1511.36] quantities can cause a heart attack
[1511.76 - 1516.62] also all the runners need to do is
[1514.22 - 1518.30] understand that they're losing sweat and
[1516.62 - 1521.42] if you taste your sweat it's very salty
[1518.30 - 1523.22] salt is sodium sodium is five times the
[1521.42 - 1525.50] loss of sodium to one time of potassium
[1523.22 - 1527.66] so the moment I find somebody who has
[1525.50 - 1530.30] potassium High it means they've lost too
[1527.66 - 1531.86] much of sodium right the problem lies in
[1530.30 - 1533.24] those who have blood pressure problems
[1531.86 - 1534.80] you can't give too much of sodium so
[1533.24 - 1537.26] that's where medical supports nutrition
[1534.80 - 1540.26] comes into play and I've had people with
[1537.26 - 1542.66] stents with bypass with high BP who are
[1540.26 - 1543.80] Runners who are triathletes and we we
[1542.66 - 1547.64] work on
[1543.80 - 1550.16] um uh from from a perspective next
[1547.64 - 1554.18] question Ryan uh would you talk a little
[1550.16 - 1557.24] bit about D3 because uh I know a lot of
[1554.18 - 1559.52] people who when when and if they do a
[1557.24 - 1561.44] test say that the D3 is like too low
[1559.52 - 1564.98] yeah and I think that's the most common
[1561.44 - 1567.26] thing that I hear from people
[1564.98 - 1568.88] uh you know the world is evolving
[1567.26 - 1571.58] artificial intelligence is coming in and
[1568.88 - 1574.34] so everyone's getting this awareness and
[1571.58 - 1576.14] knowledge but I remember in 2012 when I
[1574.34 - 1578.60] used to bet with people the whole cost
[1576.14 - 1581.66] of their diet counseling if your vitamin
[1578.60 - 1583.40] D3 is not low I'll refund the cost of
[1581.66 - 1586.22] the money of your counseling because I
[1583.40 - 1589.52] knew that Indians are 70 to 80 percent
[1586.22 - 1591.98] most likely and in 2012 nobody had this
[1589.52 - 1593.36] under on uh understanding on so even
[1591.98 - 1596.66] doctors
[1593.36 - 1598.28] and I knew that vitamin D uh was was
[1596.66 - 1600.44] most prevalent because you start doing
[1598.28 - 1602.18] it with 20 athletes and all 20 athletes
[1600.44 - 1603.80] who eat really well they're in the sun
[1602.18 - 1605.18] all the time with their shirt off and
[1603.80 - 1607.94] their youngsters and they have vitamin D
[1605.18 - 1609.14] deficiency imagine us fuddy duddies you
[1607.94 - 1612.38] know uh what's going to happen to our
[1609.14 - 1613.04] bodies so vitamin D kind of
[1612.38 - 1614.72] um
[1613.04 - 1617.00] I think the issue is because we are dark
[1614.72 - 1618.80] skinned number one and then we are in
[1617.00 - 1621.92] shortened band and how many of us I mean
[1618.80 - 1624.44] we Indians I am from Goa and if I go to
[1621.92 - 1628.04] the beach I I I will go with a t-shirt
[1624.44 - 1630.08] on and uh and full gym trousers and I
[1628.04 - 1631.64] will not go with uh shots and you know
[1630.08 - 1633.08] expose the Sun and stuff like so the
[1631.64 - 1634.82] Indians have this aversion towards sun
[1633.08 - 1636.56] bathing and stuff like that yes
[1634.82 - 1638.00] sunbathing I've seen in athletes and
[1636.56 - 1640.28] even in clients
[1638.00 - 1642.14] um it goes up by five or ten points I
[1640.28 - 1644.06] think we have lower vitamin D because of
[1642.14 - 1645.92] the skin because of the insecticides
[1644.06 - 1647.72] pesticides in our food chain which
[1645.92 - 1649.52] affect the activation of the vitamin D
[1647.72 - 1652.40] in the kidneys
[1649.52 - 1655.16] and so you take a vitamin D test blood
[1652.40 - 1657.86] test uh do it every quarter uh it's a
[1655.16 - 1661.22] lifelong supplement everyone I would I I
[1657.86 - 1663.32] do vitamin D twice a month a 60 000 IU I
[1661.22 - 1665.84] do a liquid one from Abbott laborities
[1663.32 - 1667.06] called aricatol I think it's a better
[1665.84 - 1669.28] one
[1667.06 - 1672.22] vitamin D
[1669.28 - 1675.74] aracatal 1mg you can
[1672.22 - 1677.30] erectiles 60 000. people talk about D
[1675.74 - 1678.80] rise and other things yeah yeah that's
[1677.30 - 1681.74] all okay and I found this one because
[1678.80 - 1683.30] it's it's a liquid its absorption is far
[1681.74 - 1684.86] far better because the granules I think
[1683.30 - 1687.10] can just go through and pass through you
[1684.86 - 1689.60] and don't dissolve as well as a
[1687.10 - 1691.10] nanopateicalized uh one an injection
[1689.60 - 1693.02] sometimes is the best thing that you can
[1691.10 - 1695.00] do but Runners have stopped recommending
[1693.02 - 1697.04] injections because the doctors tend to
[1695.00 - 1698.78] not understand they poke the people on
[1697.04 - 1701.26] the thigh or the bum and then you have
[1698.78 - 1704.54] that nodular vitamin D there for about
[1701.26 - 1706.40] 30-45 days and that hurts for for people
[1704.54 - 1708.14] who are on us so if you're getting the
[1706.40 - 1709.88] vitamin D injection get in the upper
[1708.14 - 1711.80] part of your body
[1709.88 - 1713.24] um but otherwise just the 60 000 IU
[1711.80 - 1716.00] would work
[1713.24 - 1718.28] very interestingly vitamin D is the Barb
[1716.00 - 1720.62] of testosterone
[1718.28 - 1723.38] so when vitamin D is low testosterone is
[1720.62 - 1725.66] low both for males and female if even
[1723.38 - 1726.74] females require testosterone males yes
[1725.66 - 1729.20] as you're growing older if your
[1726.74 - 1731.98] testosterone drops below 400 try getting
[1729.20 - 1734.96] your vitamin D levels to 60 to 70
[1731.98 - 1737.48] nanograms so 3200 is the range
[1734.96 - 1739.58] everyone's like so sorry minus 31 32
[1737.48 - 1741.14] it's like you saying I'm at the bottom
[1739.58 - 1742.76] of my class in school and you're very
[1741.14 - 1744.62] excited about it
[1742.76 - 1746.12] I'd like you to be middle of the class
[1744.62 - 1748.82] or top of the class
[1746.12 - 1750.38] so the the problem is
[1748.82 - 1751.76] um people think that if they come to the
[1750.38 - 1754.64] borderline low level like I have a
[1751.76 - 1757.52] client 218 in vitamin B12 means like
[1754.64 - 1760.88] mine's 222 no it's okay now
[1757.52 - 1764.24] so your liver holds 10 years version
[1760.88 - 1768.20] your liver holds 10 years version of uh
[1764.24 - 1770.78] B12 if it has come down to 222 it means
[1768.20 - 1772.40] in the last decade you have been fooling
[1770.78 - 1774.86] around
[1772.40 - 1777.02] I know vitamin D has your vitamin B12
[1774.86 - 1779.06] has come down so
[1777.02 - 1781.04] the vitamin B's and vitamin C's are
[1779.06 - 1782.90] water soluble you pee them out you sweat
[1781.04 - 1785.78] them out and Runners have chronically
[1782.90 - 1787.18] low B and C levels not to mention you do
[1785.78 - 1789.44] not know whether your genetic
[1787.18 - 1791.60] predisposition because you have not done
[1789.44 - 1794.12] your genetic receptor test
[1791.60 - 1796.12] we live in 2023. people have got the
[1794.12 - 1799.88] latest watches latest phones latest
[1796.12 - 1802.88] flute boards in their Halls uh double
[1799.88 - 1805.10] paned windows in their houses to escape
[1802.88 - 1807.56] pollution and heat and everything but
[1805.10 - 1810.20] when it comes to understanding the body
[1807.56 - 1812.30] and diet everyone's wigging it so I
[1810.20 - 1814.94] would say please get the genetic test
[1812.30 - 1816.68] done you will thank me 25 years later
[1814.94 - 1819.26] saying oh Ryan you told me to do this
[1816.68 - 1821.90] and whoever I'm meeting now 20 years
[1819.26 - 1823.82] later I have advised in the olden days I
[1821.90 - 1828.32] remember doing the first genetic test in
[1823.82 - 1830.24] India in 2006 with ran backseat for the
[1828.32 - 1832.76] actn sprinting Gene I was the first guy
[1830.24 - 1835.28] to ask for it and run back say like no
[1832.76 - 1837.20] doctors ever asked for it the reason is
[1835.28 - 1838.52] you want to know the crystal ball gazing
[1837.20 - 1840.86] for the future so you can make the
[1838.52 - 1842.42] interventions via nutrition any other
[1840.86 - 1844.94] questions let's move on to more
[1842.42 - 1848.96] questions or people have questions yeah
[1844.94 - 1851.96] so next question is uh carb protein and
[1848.96 - 1853.82] fat that you mentioned uh as a runner
[1851.96 - 1855.56] typically who does say average running
[1853.82 - 1858.74] training for a half or a full Marathon
[1855.56 - 1860.36] what kind of a mix of that should they
[1858.74 - 1862.48] take because there are a lot of males
[1860.36 - 1865.28] people say oh more protein less fat
[1862.48 - 1867.08] there's that all kinds you could you I
[1865.28 - 1869.44] know it's very generic it's not like but
[1867.08 - 1872.24] at least indicative figure for people
[1869.44 - 1873.08] who who are in this group to get some
[1872.24 - 1875.48] ideas
[1873.08 - 1877.22] and especially the myth that because
[1875.48 - 1879.14] you're a runner you need to have extra
[1877.22 - 1881.18] carb before race day carb loading
[1879.14 - 1883.10] everybody's doing pasta parties and
[1881.18 - 1885.98] stuff like that so I think just just
[1883.10 - 1887.48] some some light on on that
[1885.98 - 1889.76] question
[1887.48 - 1891.52] um this slide on glycogen who is
[1889.76 - 1894.86] glycogen
[1891.52 - 1897.02] glycogen is the
[1894.86 - 1899.78] combination of the carbs stored in the
[1897.02 - 1902.06] muscle I want you to imagine like this
[1899.78 - 1904.52] this small fuel tank is there
[1902.06 - 1906.98] in between the muscles you'll have
[1904.52 - 1909.74] packets of glycogen
[1906.98 - 1912.50] and in your liver you will have glycogen
[1909.74 - 1914.18] glycogen is the carb resource store no
[1912.50 - 1917.72] matter how much of pasta party you do
[1914.18 - 1919.40] you cannot go beyond this 90 minutes of
[1917.72 - 1922.28] muscle through and 90 minutes is an
[1919.40 - 1923.90] elite athlete most of us will be at 45
[1922.28 - 1927.08] minutes
[1923.90 - 1929.48] okay and by the way this this one is for
[1927.08 - 1931.58] all the women in the audience
[1929.48 - 1934.16] listen in closely
[1931.58 - 1938.08] one gram of glycogen
[1934.16 - 1938.08] holds three molecules of water
[1938.48 - 1944.12] okay you have about 800 grams of
[1942.02 - 1945.50] glycogen that can be stored in your
[1944.12 - 1947.60] muscle
[1945.50 - 1951.26] so 800 grams
[1947.60 - 1953.84] into three 2.4 liters of water is stored
[1951.26 - 1956.42] in your body in your muscle
[1953.84 - 1958.70] so when people do low carb diet boom
[1956.42 - 1960.68] they've lost three cages I lost weight
[1958.70 - 1963.08] but they stop the diet and the
[1960.68 - 1964.82] three kgs comes back that three kg is up
[1963.08 - 1966.80] and down is nothing but glycogen and
[1964.82 - 1969.44] water in your body it's a transitionary
[1966.80 - 1973.28] stage so any weight loss of one to three
[1969.44 - 1975.74] KGS is fictitious from a
[1973.28 - 1977.24] from I need to get a better body
[1975.74 - 1979.88] composition you always want to be
[1977.24 - 1981.38] looking at your fat so when you take
[1979.88 - 1983.54] carbohydrate
[1981.38 - 1985.82] if you're in the weight loss running
[1983.54 - 1989.30] mode I would say you need lesser than
[1985.82 - 1992.24] 200 grams of carbs per day to latte the
[1989.30 - 1994.04] fat out of your body if you're in
[1992.24 - 1996.20] a running mode and you shouldn't do
[1994.04 - 1999.26] weight loss mode in Marathon preparation
[1996.20 - 2001.06] so I would do fat loss in off season
[1999.26 - 2003.40] mode and
[2001.06 - 2007.12] the lead time for your Marathon
[2003.40 - 2009.34] preparation should be 120 days 4 months
[2007.12 - 2011.98] in those four months you're replenishing
[2009.34 - 2015.22] these carbs every day in that time
[2011.98 - 2016.78] depending on your body weight
[2015.22 - 2018.84] um
[2016.78 - 2023.02] 60 40
[2018.84 - 2025.96] 60. so it's about anywhere from 40 to 90
[2023.02 - 2028.48] grams per kg body weight of carbs that
[2025.96 - 2030.94] need to be given to a person so let's
[2028.48 - 2034.96] say shweta somebody is there at 60 kgs
[2030.94 - 2038.68] then I would give them six into 40 grams
[2034.96 - 2041.68] so so about I would give about 2 16 16
[2038.68 - 2043.90] to 4 sorry not forty four I would give
[2041.68 - 2046.98] them 60 I'm doing this all in my head
[2043.90 - 2049.90] right now 60 kgs I would give them four
[2046.98 - 2052.30] grams of carbohydrate per kg body weight
[2049.90 - 2053.20] so that'll be 240 grams that would be my
[2052.30 - 2055.12] equation
[2053.20 - 2056.68] right this is based on years of
[2055.12 - 2059.08] experience of just doing the permission
[2056.68 - 2060.70] calculation however if somebody's lean
[2059.08 - 2062.56] and skinny like me I could go up to up
[2060.70 - 2064.60] to five or six
[2062.56 - 2066.40] uh somebody's looking to lose weight I
[2064.60 - 2068.50] would be as conducive to come under that
[2066.40 - 2071.02] 200 so I do maybe three grams per kg
[2068.50 - 2073.48] body so 180 grams of carbohydrate with
[2071.02 - 2075.76] regards to fat
[2073.48 - 2077.44] 10 years from now they will say eat more
[2075.76 - 2079.36] fat it's not the cause of heart attack
[2077.44 - 2082.00] in fact they already think they removed
[2079.36 - 2083.74] the uh the the whole thing in America
[2082.00 - 2085.72] saying that fat is the cause of disease
[2083.74 - 2087.82] cholesterol is the cause of disease as
[2085.72 - 2090.34] per the ft and all it's it'll come to
[2087.82 - 2092.98] India slowly so this concept of full fat
[2090.34 - 2095.80] and half fat and low-fat milk and all I
[2092.98 - 2097.48] I don't think is the issue for the heart
[2095.80 - 2100.30] attacks and the blockages I think it's
[2097.48 - 2103.30] more the sugars in the diet the the the
[2100.30 - 2105.52] refined sugars and the flowers so when
[2103.30 - 2109.60] we say carb shweta I want to be looking
[2105.52 - 2111.34] at complex carbs coming in from fruit or
[2109.60 - 2113.02] coming in from vegetable or coming in
[2111.34 - 2116.74] let's say from my potato
[2113.02 - 2120.58] or my yam or my tapioca I'm not too
[2116.74 - 2124.42] happy getting my carbs from wheat jovar
[2120.58 - 2125.74] bajra rice corn flour because these are
[2124.42 - 2128.38] grains
[2125.74 - 2130.00] they cultivated their milled and then
[2128.38 - 2131.86] you take it in very concentrated so if
[2130.00 - 2134.56] you're doing a chapati I would like it
[2131.86 - 2137.50] to have more fiber in it and you know
[2134.56 - 2140.74] um balance it out well
[2137.50 - 2143.80] so when I come to the recommendation to
[2140.74 - 2146.50] people please do a balanced diet
[2143.80 - 2149.32] number one number two buy a nice table
[2146.50 - 2151.42] weighing scale which you can put on your
[2149.32 - 2153.96] uh you put a table weighing scale on
[2151.42 - 2157.84] your table and
[2153.96 - 2159.16] weigh your rice or your chapati work
[2157.84 - 2161.14] with the nutritionist to figure out
[2159.16 - 2163.06] what's the correct element and
[2161.14 - 2166.42] constantly be aware
[2163.06 - 2168.40] uh Beyond scientific tester do 100 grams
[2166.42 - 2169.66] of rice for a whole month
[2168.40 - 2171.28] see what it does to your body
[2169.66 - 2172.78] composition see what it does to your
[2171.28 - 2174.16] triglycerides and your blood test see
[2172.78 - 2175.90] what it does to your cholesterol in your
[2174.16 - 2178.12] blood test by the way carbs even affect
[2175.90 - 2181.06] your fat levels in your blood so when
[2178.12 - 2182.86] you start running and you start
[2181.06 - 2184.90] and most of you over here I don't know
[2182.86 - 2186.76] if I come from the time when we didn't
[2184.90 - 2189.76] have digital tuning so if you remember
[2186.76 - 2193.24] the car radios of FMS in the early 1900s
[2189.76 - 2194.86] the 1990s sorry you you had the fine
[2193.24 - 2196.84] knob and you had the big knob to tune
[2194.86 - 2200.26] into the radio station
[2196.84 - 2203.26] so use your exercise as the fine knob
[2200.26 - 2204.94] and use the big knob as your diet in
[2203.26 - 2208.38] terms of trying to tune into the best
[2204.94 - 2208.38] body weight that you can achieve
[2208.48 - 2211.50] the next question
[2212.38 - 2217.30] uh before she asked that I think there
[2214.54 - 2219.70] was a chat message Ryan about B12
[2217.30 - 2222.58] supplement what is a good B12 supplement
[2219.70 - 2225.52] any thoughts on that so B12 most
[2222.58 - 2228.76] vegetarians because B12 is mostly found
[2225.52 - 2231.52] only in non-veg food governments across
[2228.76 - 2235.06] the world 45 milk and cereal with B12
[2231.52 - 2239.32] the Indian government is just decided to
[2235.06 - 2242.14] start that policy in India also but
[2239.32 - 2245.02] step one vegetarians non-vegetarian
[2242.14 - 2247.54] check your B12 level step two if it is
[2245.02 - 2249.82] below 300 and you're a runner starts
[2247.54 - 2252.70] supplementing which supplement you can
[2249.82 - 2255.88] do a general multivitamin like a Supra
[2252.70 - 2259.36] then like a revital like a one a day
[2255.88 - 2261.76] like a A to Z uh a tree wolf from abroad
[2259.36 - 2263.32] a doctor mercolus from abroad or you can
[2261.76 - 2264.88] find something that's more of a natural
[2263.32 - 2266.86] multivitamin made from fruit and
[2264.88 - 2269.74] vegetable extract or you can go into
[2266.86 - 2272.62] specifics of a B12 specifics of a B12
[2269.74 - 2274.84] could be like you could do a Becca
[2272.62 - 2276.52] joules you could do a Becca zyme you
[2274.84 - 2279.04] could do neural Beyond
[2276.52 - 2281.98] um I personally do a sublingual which is
[2279.04 - 2284.38] I put a B12 dropper under the tongue uh
[2281.98 - 2286.00] Nature's Bounty has one it's getting a
[2284.38 - 2288.64] little bit more difficult to get it off
[2286.00 - 2291.66] the internet because the fssai has
[2288.64 - 2294.10] passed a rule now that all online sold
[2291.66 - 2295.78] nutraceutical supplements cannot have a
[2294.10 - 2299.26] high RDA
[2295.78 - 2300.94] and most nutritional B complexes are at
[2299.26 - 2302.74] clinical doses which will be available
[2300.94 - 2304.12] only in your Pharmacy so you may need to
[2302.74 - 2306.04] talk to your doctor about giving you a b
[2304.12 - 2308.20] complex there's a company called
[2306.04 - 2311.32] well-being which has um
[2308.20 - 2312.64] melts melts are strips that dissolve
[2311.32 - 2314.44] when you put it into your mouth I have
[2312.64 - 2317.16] my daily dose over here let me see if I
[2314.44 - 2317.16] can find it
[2319.12 - 2321.42] foreign
[2323.94 - 2328.90] I'm not endorsing it I don't endorse
[2326.38 - 2332.68] this company I just personally use it so
[2328.90 - 2336.46] I get I get a melt like this out and uh
[2332.68 - 2339.70] it's not a tablet it's a strip
[2336.46 - 2342.22] so if you can see that over there
[2339.70 - 2345.64] it's it's a it's a strip
[2342.22 - 2348.16] just a piece of paper which contains B12
[2345.64 - 2350.32] and I put it onto my tongue and that's
[2348.16 - 2353.50] it it melts and that gives me my daily
[2350.32 - 2355.96] dose of B12 and it's a vegan B12
[2353.50 - 2357.88] pretty nice flavor
[2355.96 - 2360.76] so from that perspective you can do a
[2357.88 - 2363.82] B12 that way also you can do B12 shots
[2360.76 - 2366.40] because certain people who have the gene
[2363.82 - 2368.38] receptor for B12 deficiency there's
[2366.40 - 2371.26] something known as intrinsic factor in
[2368.38 - 2374.38] the stomach anyone who has acidity or
[2371.26 - 2376.12] gut problems will not absorb B12 very
[2374.38 - 2378.40] well through the oral root
[2376.12 - 2380.44] intrinsic factors like a lock and key
[2378.40 - 2382.12] model so the B12 is then intrinsic
[2380.44 - 2384.22] factor goes and catches B12 and takes it
[2382.12 - 2386.02] for absorption so many people are born
[2384.22 - 2388.54] without the intrinsic factor production
[2386.02 - 2391.00] many people have acidity or gut problems
[2388.54 - 2393.40] the the lock and key doesn't work so you
[2391.00 - 2396.46] might want to take the B12 injections
[2393.40 - 2398.44] every four months do not think of it as
[2396.46 - 2400.68] medicine think of it as nutrition and
[2398.44 - 2400.68] tomorrow
[2401.64 - 2406.78] that you got the B12 deficiency Gene so
[2404.80 - 2407.80] think of it from that perspective and
[2406.78 - 2410.14] take
[2407.80 - 2412.48] the the medical intervention it's only
[2410.14 - 2414.64] nutrition it's not a medicine
[2412.48 - 2417.10] I see many of you smiling about the
[2414.64 - 2418.54] mummy daddy Ka Jody and anything that
[2417.10 - 2420.40] happens whenever they're like yeah Mommy
[2418.54 - 2421.96] I inherited from yourself my mother look
[2420.40 - 2424.12] at my father no no that is from your
[2421.96 - 2426.70] father's side
[2424.12 - 2428.86] so so if your face if you face The Mummy
[2426.70 - 2430.24] daddy arguments then your nutrition can
[2428.86 - 2431.80] also be blamed and your running
[2430.24 - 2433.98] performance can also be blamed on your
[2431.80 - 2436.90] mom and dad
[2433.98 - 2439.98] uh Ryan next question is on hydration
[2436.90 - 2445.36] because most are Runners and especially
[2439.98 - 2446.74] uh you know uh heat running uh and then
[2445.36 - 2448.18] of course in the follow-up question is
[2446.74 - 2450.58] also about salting things so you could
[2448.18 - 2453.88] Club the two because I'm taking watching
[2450.58 - 2456.82] time as well so hydration and salt
[2453.88 - 2457.78] um when you sweat you lose water you
[2456.82 - 2460.24] lose
[2457.78 - 2462.78] um uh salts what are the salts
[2460.24 - 2467.26] um and it's also sodium potassium
[2462.78 - 2470.50] magnesium chloride I recently designed a
[2467.26 - 2471.88] an isotonic sports drink
[2470.50 - 2473.26] um I've helped the lady break the
[2471.88 - 2475.54] Guinness World Record of non-stop
[2473.26 - 2479.20] aerobics of 26 hours
[2475.54 - 2481.60] um about a decade ago and the Apollo
[2479.20 - 2483.22] doctor in Hyderabad told her that um you
[2481.60 - 2485.02] won't be able to do this record your
[2483.22 - 2487.00] body stats are good your heart is
[2485.02 - 2488.32] amazing your ECG blah blah blah
[2487.00 - 2490.18] everything but you won't be able to
[2488.32 - 2492.34] complete this record because you will
[2490.18 - 2494.32] cramp human endurance cannot sustain
[2492.34 - 2496.06] that sort of level of 26 hours of
[2494.32 - 2498.40] aerobics
[2496.06 - 2499.90] and then that she asked the doctor how
[2498.40 - 2503.62] will it she said so doctor says you need
[2499.90 - 2506.08] to have go and find uh an amazing uh
[2503.62 - 2507.88] person who will design a designer
[2506.08 - 2512.02] solution for you so you keep hydrating
[2507.88 - 2513.88] or you keep taking infusions uh every 15
[2512.02 - 2515.62] minute break that you get every four
[2513.88 - 2518.44] hours and then they figured out they
[2515.62 - 2520.78] couldn't get the drip to and enter into
[2518.44 - 2522.70] the bloodstream in 15 minutes every four
[2520.78 - 2526.18] hour break so then they realize they
[2522.70 - 2527.56] needed to do a hydration beverage so I
[2526.18 - 2529.42] was contacted to be the guy that
[2527.56 - 2531.22] designed the solution the lady did 26
[2529.42 - 2532.36] hours of non-stop aerobics Guinness
[2531.22 - 2534.82] World Record
[2532.36 - 2536.80] now why am I sharing this with you if an
[2534.82 - 2538.72] athlete crabs if an athlete's muscle
[2536.80 - 2541.42] doesn't fire if a must athlete runs
[2538.72 - 2544.00] slower it's because they are sweating
[2541.42 - 2546.76] when they sweat they lose water water is
[2544.00 - 2549.52] very easy to replace but the salt has to
[2546.76 - 2552.64] be a five is to one five sodium to one
[2549.52 - 2554.56] potassium this makes it an isotonic
[2552.64 - 2557.46] solution for my electrolyte balance
[2554.56 - 2560.38] point of view where the osmolarity
[2557.46 - 2562.60] osmolarity means like if you step into
[2560.38 - 2564.10] my room now that the AC here and the AC
[2562.60 - 2565.60] in the corridor is almost the same
[2564.10 - 2567.94] because this is set at 25 and outside
[2565.60 - 2570.64] Corridor is set at 25. so the air will
[2567.94 - 2572.92] circulate quite ambiently but if inside
[2570.64 - 2574.72] is 19 degree celsius and outside is 25
[2572.92 - 2576.76] this air will rush out
[2574.72 - 2579.58] similarly in your body when you sweat
[2576.76 - 2581.56] your blood becomes thicker
[2579.58 - 2583.06] and when your blood becomes thicker your
[2581.56 - 2585.22] heart rate goes up
[2583.06 - 2586.84] so you want to keep your blood thinner
[2585.22 - 2589.42] how do you keep your blood thinner you
[2586.84 - 2591.34] want plasma fluid to remain but for
[2589.42 - 2593.02] plasma flu to remain it shouts out of
[2591.34 - 2597.22] the stomach and in the Sun a by Pani
[2593.02 - 2600.34] dedo when Pani comes in plain this Pani
[2597.22 - 2603.22] that has come is plain Pani but inside
[2600.34 - 2605.38] we are very elite we're very very elite
[2603.22 - 2607.12] we have got glucose we have got salt we
[2605.38 - 2609.94] have got minerals we don't want this
[2607.12 - 2614.02] Sada Wala Pani so when you give
[2609.94 - 2617.04] water with a six percent glucose and
[2614.02 - 2617.04] fructose solution
[2617.34 - 2626.28] same to same let's pull it in quickly
[2621.70 - 2626.28] you take a 10 sugar solution
[2629.94 - 2633.94] so insulin will come out you'll get a
[2632.26 - 2635.62] sugar Spike and then you get a crash so
[2633.94 - 2637.48] you completely destroy a marathon
[2635.62 - 2639.28] running because you get a you get a
[2637.48 - 2641.20] sugar crash when running so you can't
[2639.28 - 2643.18] take a high sugar solution oh sir I take
[2641.20 - 2645.28] electoral solution oh electoral is
[2643.18 - 2646.96] designed for dehydration from diarrhea
[2645.28 - 2649.00] not running
[2646.96 - 2651.40] the addition from Diary is a different
[2649.00 - 2653.68] sweat system it is a poop stress system
[2651.40 - 2655.12] not a skin sweat system so that will
[2653.68 - 2658.24] give you only a three percent solution
[2655.12 - 2659.92] of electrolytes oh sorry uh glucose and
[2658.24 - 2661.84] no fructose
[2659.92 - 2665.20] so I designed this solution called one
[2661.84 - 2667.96] Chase I'm shamelessly advertising it
[2665.20 - 2671.56] here today on this forum but shweta has
[2667.96 - 2673.18] used it in the Sahara and uh she has
[2671.56 - 2674.98] shared it with Runners across the world
[2673.18 - 2676.90] and they were like that was a lifesaver
[2674.98 - 2678.70] there's nothing great about the formula
[2676.90 - 2681.52] it was just pure science by what its
[2678.70 - 2683.62] design now hydration is important don't
[2681.52 - 2685.72] do plain water I don't care your age and
[2683.62 - 2688.06] even if you're diabetic you need some
[2685.72 - 2691.30] amount of glucose and salt what about
[2688.06 - 2693.52] salt tablets salt tablets are good when
[2691.30 - 2695.50] you're training for a marathon in normal
[2693.52 - 2698.68] training and you're looking to lose body
[2695.50 - 2700.96] fat don't do my solution do a branch
[2698.68 - 2703.48] chain amino acid and electrolytes and
[2700.96 - 2705.16] water but no glucose and fructose so
[2703.48 - 2706.90] after 30 minutes of running you're
[2705.16 - 2709.00] choking out your muscle saying hey bye
[2706.90 - 2710.26] I'm not giving any glucose so in the
[2709.00 - 2712.54] bodies like are you buy we are not
[2710.26 - 2713.80] getting any glycogen is getting depleted
[2712.54 - 2715.66] we're going to shut down the brain
[2713.80 - 2717.76] fatigue fatigue no no this person is a
[2715.66 - 2719.92] crazy person can run oh take the latte
[2717.76 - 2722.02] and start beating fat out of the body
[2719.92 - 2724.66] but you gotta run where your heart rate
[2722.02 - 2726.10] is lower so that's conditioning that's
[2724.66 - 2727.30] another subject I can take two hours
[2726.10 - 2729.52] just explaining to you how to condition
[2727.30 - 2730.90] your heart back into place
[2729.52 - 2731.76] but
[2730.90 - 2734.92] um
[2731.76 - 2737.92] that you make salt and sugar
[2734.92 - 2740.74] is like running with no offense it's
[2737.92 - 2743.26] like running with power uh chapels
[2740.74 - 2744.94] power shoes you can't run in it but it's
[2743.26 - 2748.36] not going to get you that Elite timing
[2744.94 - 2750.22] so if you're running with A6 or Brooks
[2748.36 - 2753.94] or whatever it is or Vibrams or whatever
[2750.22 - 2756.64] it's running don't don't
[2753.94 - 2759.22] I see so many people they have the so
[2756.64 - 2761.74] the such expensive equipment car they
[2759.22 - 2763.66] turn up in they're doing like plain
[2761.74 - 2766.24] water like dudes what are you doing
[2763.66 - 2769.06] understand your body understand no no
[2766.24 - 2772.00] Gatorade is uh yeah get it it's bad
[2769.06 - 2773.92] because it's got artificial coloring in
[2772.00 - 2776.02] it but otherwise it's an amazing sports
[2773.92 - 2778.24] drink I'm not endorsing Gateway but I'm
[2776.02 - 2779.92] just telling you that people tend to
[2778.24 - 2783.42] without having the knowledge about
[2779.92 - 2783.42] something tend to shoot something down
[2783.78 - 2788.74] uh explained it yeah everyone please
[2786.40 - 2790.96] take a magnesium capsule at night great
[2788.74 - 2793.12] thing doesn't cause headaches uh makes
[2790.96 - 2796.24] your poop softer gives you deeper sleep
[2793.12 - 2798.34] uh softens your muscles whatever your
[2796.24 - 2799.84] age only those who have kidney stone
[2798.34 - 2801.70] problems get in touch with me will
[2799.84 - 2803.74] redesign your electrolyte solution
[2801.70 - 2805.60] otherwise everybody else drink enough of
[2803.74 - 2807.76] water uh
[2805.60 - 2810.40] you need a sports drink when you train
[2807.76 - 2812.26] more than one hour somebody said I sweat
[2810.40 - 2814.72] buckets
[2812.26 - 2817.84] um you need to do this simple equation
[2814.72 - 2820.24] dry clothes take your measurement start
[2817.84 - 2823.48] running so let's say your weight is 50
[2820.24 - 2826.24] uh and then you run for one hour and you
[2823.48 - 2829.00] become 49 kg so you lost one kg of water
[2826.24 - 2830.38] one liter of water and how you drank 500
[2829.00 - 2833.26] mL of what along the way so you've
[2830.38 - 2835.60] actually lost 1.5 liters so your sweat
[2833.26 - 2838.36] rate replenishment should be 1.5 liters
[2835.60 - 2841.06] in this 1.5 liters I can work out the
[2838.36 - 2842.86] calculation for you and do it for you
[2841.06 - 2846.58] um and it varies from person to person
[2842.86 - 2849.22] but the ideal equation is um in Runners
[2846.58 - 2851.80] is 50 ml per kg body weight for the
[2849.22 - 2853.66] whole day's production of water so if if
[2851.80 - 2856.48] I can ask
[2853.66 - 2858.58] um I mean I know I will ask somebody
[2856.48 - 2862.02] else over here srinivas if you're
[2858.58 - 2862.02] listening and what's your body weight
[2868.14 - 2874.60] 87 cages I'll make it easy 90 into five
[2871.24 - 2876.22] you require 4.5 liters of water per day
[2874.60 - 2878.08] as a marathon runner if you're running
[2876.22 - 2880.06] on a daily basis that's the total
[2878.08 - 2881.86] consumption 4.5 liters in the day so you
[2880.06 - 2884.86] know you got to figure it out how do you
[2881.86 - 2886.18] build it you you should not take most of
[2884.86 - 2887.98] your water content when you're running
[2886.18 - 2888.82] because it sloshes around inside your
[2887.98 - 2892.18] gut
[2888.82 - 2895.06] so I think ideal hydration rates in
[2892.18 - 2897.76] running would be about 500 to 700 ml per
[2895.06 - 2899.38] hour is ideal if you can go beyond a
[2897.76 - 2901.66] liter you're a rock star
[2899.38 - 2903.22] I mean you can really uh somebody said I
[2901.66 - 2906.84] lost five Keys away today after drinking
[2903.22 - 2910.54] three liters of water I weigh 75 kgs
[2906.84 - 2914.26] so that means your squishy your sweat
[2910.54 - 2916.54] rate is eight lit
[2914.26 - 2919.92] that's like
[2916.54 - 2919.92] do you cram cushy
[2922.36 - 2928.36] Khushi forgive me I don't know that's
[2925.30 - 2931.36] Girish okay and yes that he does cram
[2928.36 - 2934.36] but he didn't cramp today he says okay
[2931.36 - 2936.22] okay yeah so so then we need to have a
[2934.36 - 2939.04] higher salt content higher glucose
[2936.22 - 2941.26] content eight percent solution and then
[2939.04 - 2943.42] we do things like chia seed pudding
[2941.26 - 2945.10] before the run so that it holds 11 times
[2943.42 - 2946.90] its weight in water the chia seeds will
[2945.10 - 2949.24] give you hydration so a lot of strategy
[2946.90 - 2954.46] like that show us some more questions
[2949.24 - 2956.98] yes a lot of people have uh many
[2954.46 - 2958.48] point of views on supplements a lot of
[2956.98 - 2960.64] people say no no I don't want to take
[2958.48 - 2962.52] supplements why take supplements you
[2960.64 - 2965.98] know and this and that so some some
[2962.52 - 2967.90] insights from experts there and there's
[2965.98 - 2971.14] a question on intermittent fasting if
[2967.90 - 2972.40] time permits will try and go to it I'll
[2971.14 - 2974.74] be able to do a little longer if
[2972.40 - 2976.48] everyone wants to come in I'm actually
[2974.74 - 2978.88] enjoying myself the energy of this group
[2976.48 - 2980.86] is really cool
[2978.88 - 2983.26] I can only imagine if you all met up and
[2980.86 - 2985.18] go of what it what would happen uh um
[2983.26 - 2986.88] the the beer would have electrolyte
[2985.18 - 2989.32] tablets dropped into it
[2986.88 - 2991.12] did we just do with the bear we will we
[2989.32 - 2993.82] will just skip it we will do the cover
[2991.12 - 2997.42] loading that's all so I I once convinced
[2993.82 - 2999.46] uh I once convinced a runner to have a
[2997.42 - 3002.30] whiskey with Gatorade and after that the
[2999.46 - 3002.30] guy got hooked
[3002.78 - 3009.06] you're giving me ideas
[3006.06 - 3011.52] so so uh yeah when I come next time to
[3009.06 - 3014.40] gurgaon I'll meet up with everyone
[3011.52 - 3018.72] um what was the question again
[3014.40 - 3020.46] um I mean on supplements supplements
[3018.72 - 3022.98] this is my this is my signature
[3020.46 - 3026.52] statement supplements
[3022.98 - 3029.28] are a nutritional convenience for your
[3026.52 - 3031.50] nutritional in discipline
[3029.28 - 3033.18] if you are nutritionally disciplined you
[3031.50 - 3035.34] don't need supplements
[3033.18 - 3037.68] if you're genetically on the back foot
[3035.34 - 3039.24] you may need a supplement but if you're
[3037.68 - 3041.10] nutritionally disciplined and you know
[3039.24 - 3043.98] your genes are perfect and you're doing
[3041.10 - 3046.32] your blood test take my example
[3043.98 - 3048.06] I take a phosphodidyl serine
[3046.32 - 3049.92] phosphorylcholine supplement for my
[3048.06 - 3053.10] brain there's no deficiency only there
[3049.92 - 3056.46] I'm just biohacking I take a supplement
[3053.10 - 3059.76] from a company called decode age which
[3056.46 - 3060.96] is nmn it's called longevit now you
[3059.76 - 3062.52] don't need to take this I'll tell you
[3060.96 - 3064.86] what I've taken after I've designed my
[3062.52 - 3065.94] structure and I take a magnesium
[3064.86 - 3068.10] supplement
[3065.94 - 3072.18] the rest I don't take because I eat
[3068.10 - 3074.88] organic I eat an amazing amount of micro
[3072.18 - 3076.50] greens because that would contain my
[3074.88 - 3077.70] chlorophyll and hopefully my micro
[3076.50 - 3080.28] nutrition
[3077.70 - 3083.70] I try and buy hydroponic stuff because I
[3080.28 - 3085.86] know they're putting Goods uh the good
[3083.70 - 3087.60] what we call is fertilizer which is the
[3085.86 - 3089.04] natural fertilizer the organic
[3087.60 - 3090.78] fertilizer in it and they're not
[3089.04 - 3095.52] spraying it that much of insecticides
[3090.78 - 3098.34] and pesticides but people who do sport
[3095.52 - 3100.86] there is a depletion of nutrition
[3098.34 - 3103.56] because of the damage of the physical
[3100.86 - 3105.66] activity on the body and thereby because
[3103.56 - 3108.96] you're building because your rooms are
[3105.66 - 3111.42] being damaged things like collagen
[3108.96 - 3112.98] more vitamin B complex and C because
[3111.42 - 3116.64] they are both water soluble and you
[3112.98 - 3118.50] sweat and pee a lot are lost protein is
[3116.64 - 3119.90] higher because there is cellular and
[3118.50 - 3123.00] structural damage
[3119.90 - 3126.84] glucosamine a chondroitin sulfate and
[3123.00 - 3128.82] MSM for your cartilage and tissue are
[3126.84 - 3131.46] some of the key things electrolytes
[3128.82 - 3133.92] could be considered and so from from
[3131.46 - 3137.40] that perspective you could
[3133.92 - 3140.28] you could look at supplements are a
[3137.40 - 3142.80] thumbs up but the thing is that people
[3140.28 - 3144.60] do like I had this client last year they
[3142.80 - 3146.04] did their own supplementation regime and
[3144.60 - 3148.50] they did ayurveda along with that and
[3146.04 - 3150.96] they got heavy metal poisoning and they
[3148.50 - 3153.18] deliver went into damage and the
[3150.96 - 3154.38] client's hemoglobin dropped from 14 to
[3153.18 - 3157.14] 9.
[3154.38 - 3158.70] over a one year period because of the
[3157.14 - 3161.30] ayurvedic supplements and the heavy
[3158.70 - 3164.16] metals in it so I I think
[3161.30 - 3165.84] self-prescription of supplements and you
[3164.16 - 3168.12] know it's like oh my God yesterday I was
[3165.84 - 3171.06] on LinkedIn there was this elderly
[3168.12 - 3173.10] gentleman must be about 5560 is talking
[3171.06 - 3174.72] about nutrition and I'm like it's
[3173.10 - 3176.70] written Stanford school of medicine and
[3174.72 - 3178.80] I was like who is this Indian I've never
[3176.70 - 3183.72] heard of I went and looked at his
[3178.80 - 3185.46] profile he's a VC I I almost lost it
[3183.72 - 3187.44] yesterday I was like I want to go public
[3185.46 - 3190.68] lunch profile and say you are not
[3187.44 - 3194.34] allowed to talk about nutrition by doing
[3190.68 - 3196.32] a certificate course in Stanford
[3194.34 - 3197.88] I'm sorry but I want to call out these
[3196.32 - 3200.52] influences out there and if you are
[3197.88 - 3202.32] doing it as you know we have we have
[3200.52 - 3205.56] running coaches who prescribe diet shots
[3202.32 - 3207.60] Ghanta these guys know anything yeah
[3205.56 - 3208.98] and you on the other hand want to take
[3207.60 - 3210.60] advice from such people just because
[3208.98 - 3212.22] they're like oh they ran so much of
[3210.60 - 3214.08] distance so they are also subject matter
[3212.22 - 3216.18] experts on nutrition is that you coming
[3214.08 - 3217.50] to me coming to me and saying Ryan give
[3216.18 - 3220.62] me my training schedule for Marathon
[3217.50 - 3224.76] running I've never run in my life
[3220.62 - 3226.56] so don't get influenced by ads about
[3224.76 - 3229.26] supplements
[3226.56 - 3231.30] people who takes up oh my friend shweta
[3229.26 - 3234.48] is taking collagen look at his skin glow
[3231.30 - 3236.70] I should also take collagen
[3234.48 - 3238.74] do it scientifically or do you service
[3236.70 - 3240.12] your own iPhone and Apple watch on your
[3238.74 - 3242.58] car yourself
[3240.12 - 3245.34] what can juicy stuff that people do yeah
[3242.58 - 3248.46] on their body sometimes I get irritated
[3245.34 - 3250.08] the guys wearing a freaking Rolex and
[3248.46 - 3252.00] then wanting to do supplement protein
[3250.08 - 3253.80] strategy Ryan tell me what protein did
[3252.00 - 3257.64] you do a food allergy test
[3253.80 - 3259.14] one guy came to me liver damage uh grade
[3257.64 - 3261.24] one fatty liver
[3259.14 - 3264.24] I said I've been training for the last
[3261.24 - 3268.02] 30 years in the gym and all 60 grams of
[3264.24 - 3270.72] protein every day I did his emu Pro is a
[3268.02 - 3272.40] German blood test for food allergy he
[3270.72 - 3275.22] says sorry 38 000 rupees for the blood
[3272.40 - 3277.14] test guys wearing a Rolex
[3275.22 - 3279.54] so Alexa please just do it listen to me
[3277.14 - 3281.04] comes back that he's allergic to casein
[3279.54 - 3282.78] he's allergic to whey he is allergic to
[3281.04 - 3284.46] Dairy and the only milk he can drink is
[3282.78 - 3287.10] camel milk
[3284.46 - 3289.32] not not cow milk not goat milk so this
[3287.10 - 3291.54] gives a whole list he's been taking whey
[3289.32 - 3293.52] protein for the last 30 years guess what
[3291.54 - 3296.16] his grade 1 fatty liver he refuses to
[3293.52 - 3298.32] believe me is the cause from his whey
[3296.16 - 3300.90] protein intake
[3298.32 - 3302.40] no no sir I drink and I got alcohol and
[3300.90 - 3303.90] I got all of this thing
[3302.40 - 3306.66] three months
[3303.90 - 3309.48] three months on a proper diet is sgot
[3306.66 - 3310.74] sgpt ggt are the liver enzymes began to
[3309.48 - 3312.48] drop
[3310.74 - 3314.36] so the supplementation by
[3312.48 - 3317.00] self-prescription harms the body
[3314.36 - 3319.44] supplementation under influencer advice
[3317.00 - 3321.18] or like for example that I won't name
[3319.44 - 3322.98] the companies they they do come to me
[3321.18 - 3325.44] and they ask me to recommend them
[3322.98 - 3327.42] but for example yesterday I saw
[3325.44 - 3329.04] Taekwondo super Champion forget that
[3327.42 - 3330.90] cricketers are talking about the
[3329.04 - 3333.48] supplement like Virat Kohli is talking
[3330.90 - 3334.68] about a supplement you should take his
[3333.48 - 3336.66] nutritionist who gave him all the
[3334.68 - 3340.02] supplement prescription
[3336.66 - 3341.82] so how can he endorse and say that this
[3340.02 - 3343.74] is a supplement you need when it is bio
[3341.82 - 3344.70] individual so wherever you go in the
[3343.74 - 3349.68] world
[3344.70 - 3352.50] do not misuse your personal real estate
[3349.68 - 3353.88] go proper do the correct testing and
[3352.50 - 3356.34] this is a simple test you want to do it
[3353.88 - 3358.38] on your own buy a supplement take a
[3356.34 - 3360.78] blood test check your resting heart rate
[3358.38 - 3362.94] take it for one month check your resting
[3360.78 - 3364.92] heart rate check your blood test if all
[3362.94 - 3366.42] parameters remain the same or improve
[3364.92 - 3368.88] it's a thumbs up
[3366.42 - 3371.52] but do not take the advice because of an
[3368.88 - 3373.56] ad or an influencer or because your next
[3371.52 - 3375.12] door neighbor is doing it it that that
[3373.56 - 3377.10] would be detrimental and that's my
[3375.12 - 3378.78] position on supplement I worked for the
[3377.10 - 3380.58] three two best supplement companies in
[3378.78 - 3383.22] the world before I started my
[3380.58 - 3384.78] quantitation clinics because every time
[3383.22 - 3387.44] we went to sell a supplement everyone
[3384.78 - 3393.14] said buy bolo
[3387.44 - 3393.14] green tea protein powder Herbal Life
[3393.26 - 3398.88] so first get your Dal travel Roti in
[3396.00 - 3400.56] alignment and then get a nutritional
[3398.88 - 3402.36] supplement it's like I don't know if
[3400.56 - 3404.28] you've seen in gurgaon and all we will
[3402.36 - 3406.94] see that old zen vehicle with a Ferrari
[3404.28 - 3406.94] sticker on it
[3410.24 - 3414.90] you get my picture it's not a Ferrari
[3413.10 - 3416.34] she's Assuming he's a Ferrari because
[3414.90 - 3417.48] he's put a Ferrari sticker he's assumed
[3416.34 - 3418.64] he's taking supplements so he's going to
[3417.48 - 3421.80] run faster
[3418.64 - 3425.46] Roti it the foundation is not perfect so
[3421.80 - 3428.46] focus on your eating strategy first go
[3425.46 - 3429.84] organic look at your Macros look at your
[3428.46 - 3431.52] blood test look at your genetic test
[3429.84 - 3433.74] look at your omega-3 testing I didn't
[3431.52 - 3436.20] talk about omega-3 testing shweta it's a
[3433.74 - 3439.26] 2400 rupee pin trick test I can send a
[3436.20 - 3441.18] kid to everyone today for 2400 rupees
[3439.26 - 3442.02] you will come to know and I promise you
[3441.18 - 3445.20] this
[3442.02 - 3446.22] if your omega-3 level is low which it
[3445.20 - 3447.48] will be
[3446.22 - 3448.80] I'm not going to do the thing we're
[3447.48 - 3449.94] going to give you back money guarantee
[3448.80 - 3451.50] because some of you may be taking
[3449.94 - 3455.82] omega-3 supplements
[3451.50 - 3459.84] but your brain is made up of 50 60 fat
[3455.82 - 3462.36] and 50 of the fat is Omega-3
[3459.84 - 3463.80] so when people start losing memory start
[3462.36 - 3465.90] going slower
[3463.80 - 3468.24] uh there was a study on Boston marathon
[3465.90 - 3470.22] runners phospholidylcholine which is a
[3468.24 - 3472.62] phospholipid which makes up 12.5 percent
[3470.22 - 3475.08] of the brain 40 percent of it dropped
[3472.62 - 3477.48] after the Boston Marathon guess what you
[3475.08 - 3481.02] train in the run-up right
[3477.48 - 3483.78] so why do people get mentally dead a
[3481.02 - 3486.06] month into the marathon they're not able
[3483.78 - 3488.52] to hold their jobs well think well see
[3486.06 - 3490.08] clearly maybe you're young you can do it
[3488.52 - 3491.76] but you need to top up your
[3490.08 - 3494.04] phosphorylserine you need to top up your
[3491.76 - 3495.90] omega-3 now the only way I would do this
[3494.04 - 3497.76] is if I did a blood test
[3495.90 - 3498.96] I know I can go on and on and on let's
[3497.76 - 3500.94] take up maybe four or five more
[3498.96 - 3502.86] questions and we'll wind up by 11 15.
[3500.94 - 3505.08] okay there was a question on
[3502.86 - 3507.48] intermittent fasting and somebody asked
[3505.08 - 3509.16] how much alcohol interfere training do
[3507.48 - 3510.96] we need to stop alcohol a little bit is
[3509.16 - 3512.46] okay so let's address intermittent
[3510.96 - 3514.08] fasting because I think that's a common
[3512.46 - 3517.02] question that comes up in a lot of our
[3514.08 - 3519.30] sessions if you have more than 50 body
[3517.02 - 3522.72] fat percentage is a man and more than 20
[3519.30 - 3524.28] body fat as a woman intermittent fasting
[3522.72 - 3525.66] will work for you if you don't get
[3524.28 - 3528.30] acidity
[3525.66 - 3529.98] please go ahead fasting why our
[3528.30 - 3533.52] ancestors in spirituality on Monday
[3529.98 - 3534.56] Thursdays Lenten Christianity
[3533.52 - 3537.72] um you know
[3534.56 - 3540.06] Ramadan in in Islam these are all great
[3537.72 - 3541.56] things unfortunately religion has become
[3540.06 - 3544.98] very um
[3541.56 - 3546.90] uh fashionable today and we tend to do
[3544.98 - 3548.64] what is required and then we don't do
[3546.90 - 3550.92] the fasting part so please do fasting
[3548.64 - 3552.66] intermittent fasting is a nice marketing
[3550.92 - 3554.58] term that people like me have brought to
[3552.66 - 3557.10] the table so that we give a certain
[3554.58 - 3558.12] Flair to it everyone used to eat at
[3557.10 - 3559.50] seven o'clock in the evening and then
[3558.12 - 3561.84] eat the next meal at seven o'clock in
[3559.50 - 3564.36] the morning it's a 12 hour fast if you
[3561.84 - 3565.68] can go from 12 to 14 to 16 to 18 to 24
[3564.36 - 3567.60] it works
[3565.68 - 3569.94] I'll share a secret to this group for
[3567.60 - 3571.94] all of you listening and so far research
[3569.94 - 3574.88] has shown that if you fast for 30 hours
[3571.94 - 3577.26] twice a month you can activate
[3574.88 - 3579.90] mitochondrial biosynthesis which means
[3577.26 - 3581.70] you kill out all the old mitochondria
[3579.90 - 3584.10] shwetan may have done this experiment
[3581.70 - 3586.38] where we do fasted State training for
[3584.10 - 3588.54] twice a week just to kill out the old
[3586.38 - 3592.02] mitochondria mitochondria the PowerHouse
[3588.54 - 3594.30] in every cell so most of us have about
[3592.02 - 3597.72] three four hundred mitochondria per cell
[3594.30 - 3599.70] Elite Runners uh younger ages have 1200
[3597.72 - 3602.52] mitochondria per cell so that's how they
[3599.70 - 3605.58] generate power and endurance so in your
[3602.52 - 3606.96] 6 200 300 to 600 you will have some old
[3605.58 - 3609.66] guys also in there because your
[3606.96 - 3612.18] nutrition is bad whatever so you want to
[3609.66 - 3614.28] get it good fasting will throw out the
[3612.18 - 3615.54] sluggish ones and recreate the new guys
[3614.28 - 3616.92] now when the new guys come in and
[3615.54 - 3619.80] nutrition is good your nutrition
[3616.92 - 3622.80] supplementation could be bang on your
[3619.80 - 3625.38] endurance ability goes up because of uh
[3622.80 - 3628.08] intermittent fasting men should train in
[3625.38 - 3630.30] fasted State women ideally should train
[3628.08 - 3632.10] in a Fed State this has been my
[3630.30 - 3634.68] realization but there are few women for
[3632.10 - 3636.24] example with your permission can I tell
[3634.68 - 3638.82] them that you train and yeah so she
[3636.24 - 3641.28] trains in a fasted State and it works
[3638.82 - 3643.74] for her she loves it but there are many
[3641.28 - 3646.02] women I I have to give them a banana I
[3643.74 - 3647.52] have to give them an old an oatmeal or
[3646.02 - 3649.38] just some chia seeds or a dry fruit
[3647.52 - 3651.24] laddu or something first thing in the
[3649.38 - 3652.26] morning before they add out on a run but
[3651.24 - 3654.72] men
[3652.26 - 3656.82] um most of us Evolution and wise were
[3654.72 - 3659.16] built to go days and days without food
[3656.82 - 3660.84] to hunt the food so uh just imagine
[3659.16 - 3662.58] yourself as a hunter going out at five
[3660.84 - 3665.88] o'clock in the morning in gurgaon mist
[3662.58 - 3668.28] and uh hunt uh hunt whatever you're
[3665.88 - 3670.98] hunting and come back to us later
[3668.28 - 3673.02] should you eat after the run ideally
[3670.98 - 3676.76] speaking yes
[3673.02 - 3676.76] okay uh alcohol alcohol
[3677.46 - 3683.82] this is a tough one being a go on uh
[3681.42 - 3686.58] let me answer this as a scientist
[3683.82 - 3689.06] research now is showing uh Google up a
[3686.58 - 3691.20] guy called Dr Daniel Amen
[3689.06 - 3693.02] I actually had the privilege of making
[3691.20 - 3695.30] friends with one of his assistant
[3693.02 - 3698.28] his name is Dr Shane I'm actually
[3695.30 - 3700.92] reading his book right now uh Peak sleep
[3698.28 - 3704.70] performance by Dr Shane criado he works
[3700.92 - 3708.54] with Dr Daniel Eamon and Dr Danny Lehman
[3704.70 - 3711.00] does spect scans of the brain and Al in
[3708.54 - 3712.92] he has pictures which actually show the
[3711.00 - 3714.66] uh Hollow things in the brain and stuff
[3712.92 - 3716.64] like that with marijuana with alcohol
[3714.66 - 3718.98] with everything no I don't drink that
[3716.64 - 3721.80] punch I just drink on the weekend
[3718.98 - 3723.18] it is affecting but at the same time I
[3721.80 - 3725.46] would love to have a drink once a week I
[3723.18 - 3727.02] do have a drink once a week I now tell
[3725.46 - 3728.94] my clients
[3727.02 - 3731.64] go from large to small
[3728.94 - 3732.96] if you did four large downgrade to four
[3731.64 - 3734.82] Smalls
[3732.96 - 3737.46] if you did two large downgrade to two
[3734.82 - 3740.58] smalls if you've done heavy weight
[3737.46 - 3742.56] training on Friday so today Saturday is
[3740.58 - 3744.54] my weight training session I'm going to
[3742.56 - 3747.30] be doing legs today so today I will not
[3744.54 - 3750.12] be drinking because when alcohol remains
[3747.30 - 3751.80] in my bloodstream for 24 hours so I'm
[3750.12 - 3755.52] going to drink today
[3751.80 - 3756.84] um at around 10 o'clock at night
[3755.52 - 3758.82] uh but I'm going to do my weight
[3756.84 - 3760.38] training like session at five o'clock so
[3758.82 - 3763.26] at five o'clock I'm going to release
[3760.38 - 3765.84] creatine kinase for the next 24 to 36
[3763.26 - 3767.28] hours to re-heal my muscle now if
[3765.84 - 3768.66] alcohol is in my system it goes and
[3767.28 - 3771.92] gives thapar to creatine kindness
[3768.66 - 3771.92] creatine cancer sorry
[3774.60 - 3778.68] so ideally if you want to be drinking
[3776.22 - 3780.78] you do not want to be drinking on the
[3778.68 - 3783.66] weekend when you do your heavy and long
[3780.78 - 3786.24] runs from an Olympic athletic
[3783.66 - 3788.88] performance point of view and if it can
[3786.24 - 3791.40] uh if it can help it if it can help you
[3788.88 - 3794.28] recover faster then no alcohol in your
[3791.40 - 3796.74] system works speaking of alcohol try and
[3794.28 - 3798.36] do the alcohols which where you dilute
[3796.74 - 3800.46] it it doesn't have more calories like
[3798.36 - 3804.00] orange juice or Coke you want to do more
[3800.46 - 3805.62] of soda water and and tonic water
[3804.00 - 3807.66] because those are the alcohols which
[3805.62 - 3808.92] will then not get the additional burden
[3807.66 - 3811.32] or calories
[3808.92 - 3813.54] should you eat and then drink alcohol
[3811.32 - 3814.74] highly recommend it so you you lie in
[3813.54 - 3816.84] your stomach and it doesn't get
[3814.74 - 3819.48] sanitized with the alcohol that goes
[3816.84 - 3821.34] into you and and this is this is not
[3819.48 - 3823.08] this is my question actually is that
[3821.34 - 3825.48] drinking post run because a lot of
[3823.08 - 3828.84] people say oh now I've done my Marathon
[3825.48 - 3830.82] TV and let's let's have their
[3828.84 - 3832.50] sure that there are two types of runners
[3830.82 - 3835.08] okay there are Runners who are serious
[3832.50 - 3838.20] and then our Runners are having fun
[3835.08 - 3839.94] and and as a sports nutritionist I cater
[3838.20 - 3841.38] to both audiences if you're a fun loving
[3839.94 - 3842.46] person go ahead and drink I mean it's
[3841.38 - 3843.90] not the end of the world it's not like
[3842.46 - 3845.34] you're going to get a catastrophic heart
[3843.90 - 3847.98] attack after that
[3845.34 - 3850.02] but know this that
[3847.98 - 3851.52] if another marathon is coming up four
[3850.02 - 3852.78] weeks later you would not do that
[3851.52 - 3854.64] because
[3852.78 - 3856.56] there's catastrophic damage in your
[3854.64 - 3858.78] muscle and it's going to take like about
[3856.56 - 3862.52] a week for it to heal back
[3858.78 - 3864.84] and immediately there is a window of
[3862.52 - 3867.42] rebuilding which is the first three days
[3864.84 - 3869.04] after what we call as microscopic trauma
[3867.42 - 3870.36] and in the case of marathon running is
[3869.04 - 3872.28] called microscopic trauma it's
[3870.36 - 3874.08] macroscopic trauma it's like somebody's
[3872.28 - 3875.76] taken a latte and beaten the life out of
[3874.08 - 3877.92] your glutes your hams your quads and
[3875.76 - 3880.26] your calves not to mention the cartilage
[3877.92 - 3882.06] and the ligaments and tendons in in the
[3880.26 - 3883.80] lower part of your posterior chain which
[3882.06 - 3885.42] is the legs
[3883.80 - 3887.88] so
[3885.42 - 3890.52] I would do a celebratory glass of wine
[3887.88 - 3893.04] or whiskey but I I've seen people go
[3890.52 - 3895.26] berserk after that and I think it's only
[3893.04 - 3898.74] slowing down your recovery I did have
[3895.26 - 3901.74] one very funny uh uh Punjabi gentleman
[3898.74 - 3904.82] uh another punjabis live life king size
[3901.74 - 3907.98] and he was like Ryan yeah protein Shaker
[3904.82 - 3909.96] patiala Peg and he would do both and I
[3907.98 - 3911.70] think that was the balance of the Two
[3909.96 - 3913.56] Worlds being fun and being performance
[3911.70 - 3916.02] and everything I do not endorse alcohol
[3913.56 - 3917.82] drinking Post Run
[3916.02 - 3919.32] but if you're a fun person and you're
[3917.82 - 3921.00] fun loving person
[3919.32 - 3924.50] uh we'll figure out how to balance your
[3921.00 - 3926.88] alcohol and your your supplementations
[3924.50 - 3929.94] I'll just show that there was a question
[3926.88 - 3934.20] Just One Last Question Ryan about can
[3929.94 - 3937.56] women start running after 50.
[3934.20 - 3939.18] why not is my question so I this is the
[3937.56 - 3941.40] advice I would give somebody came fresh
[3939.18 - 3943.68] to me number one is I would get them in
[3941.40 - 3945.72] touch with a great uh exercise
[3943.68 - 3948.36] physiotherapist
[3945.72 - 3950.46] to do an assessment of her body
[3948.36 - 3952.56] range of motion and all and then not
[3950.46 - 3955.26] start running immediately but first
[3952.56 - 3958.20] build three months of structured
[3955.26 - 3959.76] training uh cardio walking get all the
[3958.20 - 3962.34] joints moving get the diet in place
[3959.76 - 3964.86] because she might at that point have 10
[3962.34 - 3966.54] 15 more body fat which is dead weight on
[3964.86 - 3969.62] her
[3966.54 - 3969.62] next counseling
[3970.10 - 3977.72] so that's my secretary reminding me to
[3972.72 - 3980.16] move on so uh uh where was I
[3977.72 - 3981.66] yeah so the ladies come in and she gets
[3980.16 - 3983.70] all of this done get the diet in place
[3981.66 - 3985.56] look at the micro nutrition and all and
[3983.70 - 3987.90] then she should get a great running
[3985.56 - 3989.34] coach to come in and then build that
[3987.90 - 3991.20] thing now she just suddenly decides to
[3989.34 - 3993.00] run five kilometers and first it doesn't
[3991.20 - 3994.74] work and if you've seen a professional
[3993.00 - 3996.06] running coach they're like are you going
[3994.74 - 3998.52] crazy you just are going to ask me to
[3996.06 - 4001.28] walk for the first two weeks but that's
[3998.52 - 4003.26] the right thing that a person should do
[4001.28 - 4006.08] um and as a nutritionist though it's not
[4003.26 - 4008.06] my domain as an exercise physiologist I
[4006.08 - 4011.66] would highly recommend women after the
[4008.06 - 4014.30] age of 50 to weight train you have to
[4011.66 - 4017.78] wait train because you need to retain
[4014.30 - 4021.50] your muscle even men muscle is the only
[4017.78 - 4024.62] age reversible organ in the human body I
[4021.50 - 4028.42] repeat muscle is the only age reversible
[4024.62 - 4031.04] organ running doesn't build muscle
[4028.42 - 4033.44] running box on the cardiovascular
[4031.04 - 4036.92] endurance because it's body weight but
[4033.44 - 4040.10] if you want to get better bone density
[4036.92 - 4043.10] better testosterone lesser fat Mass both
[4040.10 - 4045.86] male and female after the age of 50 I
[4043.10 - 4048.08] would not buy that Mercedes-Benz where
[4045.86 - 4050.66] the Emi is one lakh rupees I would buy a
[4048.08 - 4052.94] skoda superb where the Emi is 45 000
[4050.66 - 4055.94] rupees I would take out that 45 000
[4052.94 - 4058.40] rupee Emi and give it to a strength
[4055.94 - 4060.02] trainer a Pilates trainer and a yoga
[4058.40 - 4062.60] instructor and I would do classes with
[4060.02 - 4065.36] them every month because your body is
[4062.60 - 4068.54] the Mercedes-Benz is the Rolls-Royce so
[4065.36 - 4071.00] please invest in an amazing qualified
[4068.54 - 4072.80] not housekeeping trainer
[4071.00 - 4074.24] most of the gyms in this part of the
[4072.80 - 4076.34] world the housekeeper after six months
[4074.24 - 4078.56] becomes a trainer in the gym
[4076.34 - 4080.78] finding the person don't be afraid to
[4078.56 - 4082.94] ask the certification from the trainer
[4080.78 - 4084.86] what did you do where did you study oh
[4082.94 - 4086.60] yours is a certification
[4084.86 - 4088.10] see who all the persons training is
[4086.60 - 4090.32] there a certain science is there a
[4088.10 - 4091.58] certain logic and if you have any doubts
[4090.32 - 4093.98] get in touch with me I know all the best
[4091.58 - 4096.26] trainers in the country
[4093.98 - 4099.26] I hope I answer your question absolutely
[4096.26 - 4099.26] perfectly
[4102.94 - 4107.90] so I just want to add this you know
[4105.38 - 4110.48] importance of having a strength trainer
[4107.90 - 4112.88] or a running coach even if you're just a
[4110.48 - 4117.20] simple maintenance Runner like me no
[4112.88 - 4120.32] like I just retired Ryan and no people
[4117.20 - 4122.42] are surprised that you have retired have
[4120.32 - 4125.18] consciously chosen not to do anything
[4122.42 - 4127.64] for some time that you know I pay 12K
[4125.18 - 4129.80] for my strength right now for 12 classes
[4127.64 - 4132.32] a month and I have a running coach who
[4129.80 - 4133.04] also charges a certain fees people do I
[4132.32 - 4135.20] will
[4133.04 - 4138.02] press that I am retired but I still have
[4135.20 - 4140.30] a one-to-one personal trainer I mean I
[4138.02 - 4142.70] would rather not vacation and go I
[4140.30 - 4145.76] really don't do any fancy parties
[4142.70 - 4147.86] Vacations so I think people are not
[4145.76 - 4149.44] realizing it that you know you need to
[4147.86 - 4152.24] save to be able to
[4149.44 - 4155.66] spend on these things so I really value
[4152.24 - 4157.70] what uh Ryan is reinforcing that having
[4155.66 - 4160.52] a qualified strength trainer they just
[4157.70 - 4162.44] see a lot of videos and start doing and
[4160.52 - 4164.00] that's when I think they get a backache
[4162.44 - 4166.04] or they get this and the extremas
[4164.00 - 4168.20] they're not doing anything Rama what was
[4166.04 - 4171.02] your profession before you retired
[4168.20 - 4173.30] I was in the tech industry you were the
[4171.02 - 4174.74] tech industry all of us dabble in stocks
[4173.30 - 4177.02] and shares right we think they're very
[4174.74 - 4179.18] good investors when you get a
[4177.02 - 4181.40] professional financial advisor you
[4179.18 - 4184.40] realize your money grows much better
[4181.40 - 4186.20] most people are like that they will try
[4184.40 - 4188.12] and do the workouts on their own
[4186.20 - 4190.40] thinking that they can manage their
[4188.12 - 4193.10] money sorry manage their body better
[4190.40 - 4194.96] but what you have to say Rama and and
[4193.10 - 4196.10] it's amazing that you know pointed this
[4194.96 - 4199.58] out
[4196.10 - 4201.74] you will compound the investment
[4199.58 - 4204.32] of what you invest in the trainer not
[4201.74 - 4207.26] today but when you're 90 years of age
[4204.32 - 4209.24] you will walk up the stairs and when you
[4207.26 - 4211.40] board a flight in India you will be the
[4209.24 - 4212.90] only 90 year old who doesn't ask for a
[4211.40 - 4216.20] wheelchair
[4212.90 - 4219.32] now that Madam no money can buy and as
[4216.20 - 4221.50] MasterCard says that is priceless
[4219.32 - 4221.50] okay
[4221.60 - 4225.92] Ryan uh I know there are more there will
[4224.36 - 4227.48] be more questions this is never ending
[4225.92 - 4229.94] one session one hour with you is never
[4227.48 - 4231.62] enough uh for the others if there are
[4229.94 - 4233.24] more questions we'll we'll either gather
[4231.62 - 4235.22] the questions and try and get a response
[4233.24 - 4237.02] for that I know maybe get back Ryan Ryan
[4235.22 - 4239.66] will be kind enough maybe to come back
[4237.02 - 4241.52] again for another session I'm happy too
[4239.66 - 4243.32] I'm happy to work with any people over
[4241.52 - 4245.12] here who have organizations and they
[4243.32 - 4246.80] want a speaker at the organization and
[4245.12 - 4250.22] stuff like that
[4246.80 - 4252.80] um it's it's my give back to society uh
[4250.22 - 4254.60] in terms of I've become very successful
[4252.80 - 4257.36] and and happy to do this with
[4254.60 - 4259.34] like-minded people uh because you become
[4257.36 - 4260.72] the brand ambassadors of nutrition you
