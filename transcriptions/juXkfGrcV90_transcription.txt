Tea leaves contain flavonoids, which are powerful antioxidants that protect the eyes from disorders like cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Gallocatechin, a flavonoid that accumulates in the retina and protects it from harmful UV radiation, is one such flavonoid. Furthermore, consuming green tea may aid weight loss. Caffeine and catechins in it have been demonstrated to improve fat burning and promote metabolism.
