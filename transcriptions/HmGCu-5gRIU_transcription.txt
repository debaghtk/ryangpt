Transcript: hey guys if you're not able to watch my long form content of podcast here are some short form clips for you to enjoy can you enlighten me on some of the modernday yogi rituals that all all a lot of us should aspire to or start doing to have this sort of not Nirvana but that Serene moment that you achieved firstly you would be surprised to know that I'm diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and I've taken medications for a brief period of my life I wouldn't have noticed that in today's podcast at all you're very calm so um and perhaps I lived with it I don't know but I was a sports person so I think a lot of that got worked out when we say yoga the literal meaning of the word yoga is Union right it is not an exercise form as it is made out to be it's an experiential reality so when we say Union there is always an element of invol involvement there is a misunderstanding among many if you're doing one hour of yoga and going about with your day you've done your daily quota of yoga but that's not the case yoga has to be a moment to moment reality every moment I should be in yoga because if yoga literally means Union I cannot read about Union I can't do Union I can only experience Union and Union has to be a moment to moment reality so in this moment I'm having a conversation with you am I in yoga am I completely involved with you without any discrimination without any judgments that is Yoga I'm drinking this glass of water am I 100% involved with this process that's youa doing the ASAS twisting and turning your body is just catalyzing the process but it doesn't stop there so that's the biggest misconception that people have yoga has to be a 24 by7 process so that's the first thing having said that there are various prescriptions uh which facilitate the state of involvement the first thing being waking up at Brahma Murat what is Brahma Murat Brahma Murat would be considered the last quarter of the night which is anywhere between 3:30 a.m. to 5:30 or 6:00 a.m. scientifically we say that the pineal gland is working at its best the secretion of the pineal gland the Melatonin they all of them are working at its maximum which means that being in a pleasant mood within yourself is not a problem also I believe that the nature is aligned the planets are aligned in such a manner that it creates a conducive state for you to sort of grasp anything or for you to be in a certain balanced state so typically we would utilize this time period in fact there is another study which shows that this quality of your urine is very different at this particular time in comparison to any time any other time during the day so the idea is to wake up and do a practice that you have been initiated into now when we say initiation it's about learning a yoga practice which affects your pric system which affects your energy system and what is pric system so there are multiple bodies within a human system so there is a physical body which is the anosha or the food body there is the manoosha or the Mind Body there is a Prana mosha which is the energy body and there is the vigana mosha I don't know the English equivalent of that knowledge body not quite vigana mosha and Anand mosha which is the Bliss body so what yoga is doing is that it goes to the pranam mosha which is the energy body and the help of a guru comes where you have to be pushed from the pranam kosha to the other dimensions further up Vian kosha Anand kosha that a guru can do for you which is why having a guru in your life becomes important but any teacher Any teacher who's been trained who has some good intention for you can take you to pranam kosha once the pranam myosha or the energy body is activated you will see that its benefits permeate down to the mental body so your mind is great and the physical body which is why if you see a lot of yogis especially the ones who are living in the Himalayas or somewhere let's say in the forest they don't know what they're eating they don't know what they're drinking there are minor poisons coming into their food and water all the time but you'll see that they're in great physical health their sleep quter is very Less in fact they don't even sleep there is a culture among so many yogis where they don't sleep at all because we say that sleep is a form of inertia and you want to reduce that to the best possible extent now they're not falling sick and the reason is that the pranam kosha or the energy body is fully activated and is in full flow so this is what uh the pranam kosha is so when you wake up in the morning and do your spirit rual work or your sadhana as we say your yoga practice it activates your pranam myosha which means that your mind will be great and your body will be perfect before that we say You must take a shower in the morning and a cold water shower preferably uh I was going to ask you about that because a lot of people do take a warm water bath in the morning and so how does the how did the different bodies join together with the cold shower so when we say cold shower we not looking like we're not looking at uh a temperature which is very very cold uh this would be anywhere say 5 to 8Â° Centigrade below the room temperature and this is simply because scientifically speaking we say that there are pores between the cells and when you take a cold water shower that opens up and energy begins to permeate it enters and it recharges the cellular structure so as a result of which you're much more energized you can do your sad without you know feeling drous and if it's let's say you're living in cold climatic conditions then we say lukewarm water but never hot water because the hot water opens up the cells and it creates inertia and drowsiness now for a regular individuals who's not into yoga sadna it may not matter but for a yogi who is staying up for a long time who's doing about 4 hours of sadna it can become problematic additionally I think there is a lot of literature Now by Andrew huberman for example who has extensively researched on the importance of the dopamin release correct so uh so cold shower becomes very important in the life of a yogi and we always say that you start from here and then allow the water to trickle down after that the most important thing is emptying your bowels first thing when you wake up so all of this cold shower and emptying your balls and urination should be done before you start your practice always when you wake up first thing in the morning so in traditional Sciences B Yoga ayurveda we say that the headqu qu of most diseases is the colon It's 90% of the diseases that we know chronic or otherwise is in the colon not just P are you able to completely evacuate your BS so we say it should be as clean as a water pipe in fact there's a culture among the yogis a certain sect of yogis where they use the anal cavity as a suction pipe they suck the water in they'll sit in a pool of water suck it in and then Purge it through their mouth and it's squeaky clean wow so colon health is very very important gut health becomes very important and doing your practices on an empty stomach becomes important because there is a certain ascendance of energy when you're doing your sadhana you will feel that as you become more sensitive and aware that the Energy starts moving upwards there is feces it's going to get blocked so this is why as a sports nutritionist I've always never been able to understand why yogic don't sip any sports drink or protein powder or anything before their yoga practice even though it's very intensive it's because that chakras or those energies come in from the essence of your core am I right in that they could come from the lower Dimensions we don't know what that Dimensions is that would be dependent on your state of evolution my CH my energy could start from here yours could start from here we don't know but the idea is that there is a certain upward movement and we don't want to rest and putting food in at that time kind of hinders hinders you from discovering in it or tapping into your best energy source and allowing it to move upward essentially hey guys if you've enjoyed this
