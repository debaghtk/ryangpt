Title: DNA testing will tell you everything you need to know about what to eat and what to avoid #genetics

Description: Did you know? Your body is the hardware, and your genetic material is the software that runs the body, so if the software is programmed in a certain way, it will function in that way only. A genetic test is like a program that can read that software and tell us what exactly it is designed to do. A crystal ball gazing into one's body and future. Get in touch with me ðŸ‘‡

[0.16 - 4.48] well my kid he's a nutritionist son
[2.36 - 6.44] perfect diet perfect dental hygiene
[4.48 - 8.40] would you believe it he had 11 cavities
[6.44 - 10.32] now when I wrote the book wheatless in
[8.40 - 12.32] Israel there's a pediatric study done
[10.32 - 14.28] among 90 children and they found out
[12.32 - 16.52] that children that were DNA sensitive to
[14.28 - 19.28] gluten or who had celiac disease had a
[16.52 - 22.56] higher incidence of PLA and Cavities
[19.28 - 25.28] almost 90% more so I did not know this
[22.56 - 28.00] and my kid was happily eating pastries
[25.28 - 30.12] cakes biscuits you know uh bread and all
[28.00 - 32.00] of the stuff that contained gluten and
[30.12 - 33.64] when I did his DNA test and then I found
[32.00 - 35.80] out that I had to remove these foods and
[33.64 - 37.64] we strategically removed them lo and
[35.80 - 39.80] behold those Le cavities were treated by
[37.64 - 41.92] the dentist but no more cavities after
[39.80 - 45.76] that so sometimes food could be the
[41.92 - 45.76] culprit it's not the dental hygiene
