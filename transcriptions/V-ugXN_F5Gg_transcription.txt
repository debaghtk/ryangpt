[2.24 - 6.48] in our crops is dropping because of
[4.20 - 8.68] constant farming so farmers are using
[6.48 - 10.52] micronutrition in crops increase the
[8.68 - 12.16] iron content increase the Magnesium
[10.52 - 14.00] content like I do a little bit of
[12.16 - 15.60] vegetable growing on my Terrace and I
[14.00 - 17.72] know that when the leaves turn yellow in
[15.60 - 19.64] color I need to include potassium I need
[17.72 - 22.48] to include nitrogen I need to include
[19.64 - 24.32] magnesium on certain days so and
[22.48 - 25.92] sometimes I use ion filings and stuff
[24.32 - 28.00] like that that's micronutrition to the

[28.00 - 32.48] deficient if your genetics inherited
[30.48 - 34.88] from her mommy daddy in the nutritional
[32.48 - 36.72] absorption micronutrient absorption is
[34.88 - 40.16] low but if you're lucky and you won the
[36.72 - 42.64] genetic Lottery is mmy Daddy so the call
[40.16 - 44.76] over here as the world evolves will be
[42.64 - 48.28] you will be able to test rely on organic
[44.76 - 48.28] food eat to your heart's content
