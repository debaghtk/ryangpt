Title: EXAM DIET PLAN

Description: Stress can significantly impact the exam performance of a child, creating a complex interplay between psychological and physiological factors. When a child experiences stress, whether stemming from academic pressure, fear of failure, or external expectations, the body's stress response is triggered. This can lead to the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which, when chronically elevated, can negatively affect cognitive functions. High stress levels may impair memory, concentration, and decision-making abilities, all crucial components for effective exam performance. Additionally, stress can contribute to anxiety and nervousness, potentially hindering a child's ability to recall information and demonstrate their true understanding of the subject matter. Creating a supportive and positive environment, teaching stress management techniques, and encouraging a healthy work-life balance are essential steps in helping children cope with stress and optimize their exam performance.
