Title: Surprising reasons our food is getting weaker

Description: The mineral and vitamin content of wheat and rice may experience a significant drop due to various factors such as soil depletion, agricultural practices, and climate change. These staple grains, rich in essential nutrients, are crucial for providing the global population with energy and key micronutrients. However, modern farming methods often focus on high yields at the expense of soil health. Continuous cultivation without proper rotation and replenishment of nutrients can deplete the soil, leading to a decline in the nutritional value of crops. Additionally, climate change-related factors, such as altered rainfall patterns and increased temperatures, may further impact the nutrient content of these grains. It is essential for agricultural practices to evolve towards sustainable and regenerative approaches to ensure the continued nutritional quality of our food sources.

[0.08 - 4.20] India your food is getting weaker latest
[2.52 - 6.12] research published by National Institute
[4.20 - 9.36] of nutrition says that our wheat and
[6.12 - 12.28] rice is getting weaker by 2024 year on
[9.36 - 13.96] year the mineral content in our Foods is
[12.28 - 15.76] dropping you want to be sure about it
[13.96 - 18.80] get a vitamin and mineral blood test
[15.76 - 20.92] done for 2024 switch to organic foods
[18.80 - 23.44] get the blood test done consult your
[20.92 - 25.84] medical dietitian to know what to eat
[23.44 - 27.92] and what not to eat better still add a
[25.84 - 30.00] few minutes in there because research is
[27.92 - 32.84] now showing that the calcium drop in
[30.00 - 35.16] rice is going to be 57% the wheat drop
[32.84 - 37.76] of calcium is going to do 22% and the
[35.16 - 40.32] iron protects us from anemia iron drop
[37.76 - 42.60] in rice is going to be a whopping 40%
[40.32 - 45.08] and in wheat 24% for me as a
[42.60 - 46.84] nutritionist I'm alarmed by these levels
[45.08 - 48.88] because this means whilst you assume
[46.84 - 51.40] you're eating natural and healthy it
[48.88 - 54.00] could be that the crops do not contain
[51.40 - 56.32] the requisite mineral nutritional power
[54.00 - 59.04] in it which is kind of a blindfold over
[56.32 - 61.80] your as remove this blindfold in 2024 by
[59.04 - 64.04] subscribing organic food do a vitamin
[61.80 - 65.68] and mineral blood test do a genetic test
[64.04 - 67.12] start walking start breathing better
[65.68 - 69.44] start sleeping better and I'll see you
[67.12 - 71.24] on the other side in 2024 is you and I
[69.44 - 74.32] get healthier because the food isn't
[71.24 - 74.32] getting us healthier
