[0.08 - 3.32] if it comes in a plastic packet you
[1.72 - 4.52] should be a little bit cautious first so
[3.32 - 5.76] let's assume you want to buy something
[4.52 - 8.12] from a plastic packet whether it's
[5.76 - 9.72] Biscuits energy bar an irrated beverage
[8.12 - 10.92] whatever it is they will have words
[9.72 - 12.40] written on the ingredient the only thing
[10.92 - 14.48] is not to be too intelligent about
[12.40 - 16.36] reading the label be intelligent about
[14.48 - 17.92] just saying it's a chemical and if I'm
[16.36 - 19.28] doing it maybe once or twice a month
[17.92 - 21.48] thumbs up but if you're doing it every
[19.28 - 23.24] day so for example there is a health
[21.48 - 24.28] drink which recently went to court by
[23.24 - 26.00] the government and they said you have to
[24.28 - 27.52] remove the health drink label on it and
[26.00 - 29.16] all the e-commerce apps I've been asked
[27.52 - 30.44] to delist it and put it into a normal
[29.16 - 32.36] beverage category I looked at this
[30.44 - 34.16] health beverage what I found out was it
[32.36 - 35.96] did not have chocolate in it it had
[34.16 - 37.84] chocolate flavoring don't look for any
[35.96 - 39.56] exotic chemical name look for the word
[37.84 - 41.28] flavor if flavor is there you know it's
[39.56 - 43.16] chemical because if you want a chocolate
[41.28 - 44.68] you will get cacao or cocoa bean and
[43.16 - 46.76] that is very expensive but when you look
[44.68 - 48.36] at something added into a milkshake or a
[46.76 - 49.92] beverage and it says chocolate flavor
[48.36 - 51.56] strawberry flavor that is just a
[49.92 - 54.20] chemical synthetic flavor you're being
[51.56 - 58.08] corned into eating something at a taste
[54.20 - 58.08] B level not at a nutritive level
