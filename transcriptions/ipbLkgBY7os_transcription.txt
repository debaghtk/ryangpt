have a superar Our Guest today maruna yoga meditation Health Wellness Instagram influencer well let's speak to her directly and get her viewpoints on what she's advising the younger generation today the generation that we call as jenzi is her generation of focus um first of all thank you so much Ryan for having me in this podcast let me take you back a couple of years when I was in school I actually grew up in an entirely different country and the food that was available there the vegetables they were all imported so even if I was eating a well balanced diet back then comparatively better than most of my friends in fact I was in fact known as one of the people who used to be very health conscious even then and after my school was done I came to India I studied in nit TR my entire body completely shifted I started to see a lot of changes within my body itself I started to develop dust allergy when I did not even have that in the first place sinusitis I started developing stomach ulcers every 6 months that I had to be hospitalized I had to take drips bottles of drips every six months and that that bad it was that bad could it be could it have been the food that you were eating at the hostels where you were studying one could definitely be that food could have been something another Factor could be the way that my gut microbiome itself was earlier versus now I may not have been resistant to certain foods which certain Indians were building that resistance as they were living in this country so because of that shift my body just could not take that so what so what did you do then from that discovery of not being well in the gut and falling sick all the time at that point I could not really do anything I was not able to understand how to figure this out I was going to the hospital every 6 months and I was also having my NCC routine where I was fit as well so I was having a good enough body I was having a good enough diet but still there were several factors which were holding me back healthwise I was not understanding as to what more could I possibly do to make my health better so that is where it truly started after those four years I came into Bangalore and the story continued I thought having better quality of food me controlling the ingredients that I was having would make the situation better but it truly did not that is when I started to reflect back looking how old were you when you when this was happening um I was 18 19 20 and when I came to Bangalore I was 21 years old so this is when 21 was the start of when I truly realized that it was not just the food that I was eating but it was the way I was eating as well was there any one point in those years when you were doing chemical engineering is what you said yeah so when you were like studying chemistry and engineering and all of that stuff obviously to get into engineering means you're very smart in the head so there must have been a smart brain Point saying that I need to do something about this was it in the first year second year third year did you watch a video or did your mother say something to you could it was it one specific point or it was happened over a period of time okay um I think it was those every 6 months I had some sort of a realization that there was something definitely going wrong right but it was it still took me a lot of years to really pinpoint as to what I was doing wrong it was not one thing that I was doing wrong it was multiple things that I was doing wrong on a constant basis I was not happy with the way that I generally was I was having so much stress for absolutely no reason at all and that was causing a lot of the issues that I was having inside I was so stressed that the food that I was eating was just not doing me any sort of service as well the stress of Performing well in those four years especially when it is a Government College it's very competitive you have these certain standards you need to meet you need to be on top of the class at all points of time you need to get the right kind of job so it was several things which sort of contributed to this which took me a lot of maturity and it did take me a lot of years to understand so when you finished and you came out you knew you were going to go in the direction of Health and Wellness or it was still unknown at that point I would say that from college I was very well aware that Health Fitness and Wellness was something that was very integral however I did not deep dive deep as much as I did until a couple of years ago it was more of me just reflecting back on my body I started to do all sorts of diets you would not even believe I went on this water diet for 4 days where I did not drink water because people said it will detox your body from inside and you will have Clarity of Mind thoughts any stomach related issues would also get cleared I presume you went through a nightmare of a period by the end of that it was absolutely horrible I would stare at swiggy and just look at Dal Mak and be like oh man when is the time when I will get that Marcel of food into my mouth and eventually I just once that was done I did not go back to doing all these so you you work with thousands of people and you guide them from the Mind perspective and all so from your personal learning uh you would not recommend anyone to do a nonwater fast right with without water fast go with nothing am I right yeah it does not make sense I mean at the end of the day your body itself naturally detoxifies itself from within all we need to do is Aid that how do we help our body do that better that is what we need to really look at going on these fasts where you only drink water for a couple of days only go on these raw vegan diets I'm not saying these diets are wrong do it in the right way do it balanced such that it's actually nourishing you from inside my mental health went to an absolute Downer during those 4 days I was so miserable but that is not how it's supposed to be right you shouldn't your answer should not be an extreme solution your answer should be a balance and that is what needs to wise words very wise words you know I genuinely believe that people try fasting research has shown that 30 hours of fasting actually rejuvenate the body but people don't do it right and the the word right equals scientific every body is different and you know you have to change it accordingly now speaking of you doing these different diets and all what's your normal daily routine like as a wellness coach he health coach a practitioner of yoga a teacher of yoga what's your normal day like all right so when I wake up in the morning it is usually at about 6:30 and at that time I'm not joking you will have the absolute best poop of your life because your body at that time is ready to detoxify that time between 4: to 6:00 a.m. is one of the best times to actually go and take a dump in the bathroom so you will see the poop that comes out is actually very free flowing and you it's completely flushed out from your body so that time is the time when I usually wake up complete my business in the bathroom and post that I immediately take my yoga mat to the Terrace don't do anything I don't even take my phone for the first one or two hours in my day when I wake up that is something that I've kept very strictly for myself I don't want any sort of distractions as a meditation person why do you advise people not to touch their phone first thing in the morning as soon as you wake up the first thing that you see sort of sets the intention for the rest of the day sets the intention yes so your intention is to do yoga and meditation what sort of intention comes out of that okay when I go up and sit for pranayam what is pranayam pranayam is the art of regulation of breath that you do on your own to improve your state of being now Prana itself pranayama is broken into two parts one is Prana Prana means the life force energy and iama is the regulation of it so we practice these breathing techniques which will give us certain kinds of results so for example if you are someone who are who is in general feels very cold during the winter there are certain pranama techniques which you can practice to build up that heat from inside so there was one uh time when I was actually riding the scoty in Bangalore and I was feeling absolutely cold I was wearing half sleeves like you know I was thinking that you know I can handle it and all of that and I was driving and I was feeling very cold the air just hits your chest right I was sitting and doing pranam while I was driving to build the heat inside of my body and I was fine right so pranayam is so beautiful because it I just thought of I just thought of the Tibetan Monks who sit in the Himalayas and they put these cold blankets in him so I'm thinking of Muna is riding a scooty and you can see you can see steam coming off her body because it's cold in Bangalore and she's like a fog machine going through the city so that's the thing right you see these yogis who have been practicing pran for years and years and years who've dedicated their life to that they are sitting in the Himalayas with just a cloth around their waist and that's it and people wonder and think how is that possible is because they're doing these practices for years and years with the right kind of intention building that kind of immunity from inside you will not believe the benefits of pranayam are absolutely like wonderful it any stress related issue or stress induced uh disease that you might get pranayam completely reverses that or helps you manage that better so so for the unenlightened like me uh we get up in the morning and we rush and take our kid to school obviously it means I have to get up a little bit earlier how fast could I do a pranayama and a yoga technique like you going up to the Terrace and doing it for 1 hour right is it allowed to do it in a shorter duration and if shorter duration how short can I get the benefits of this okay I don't do plan for one I do 20 minutes only 20 minutes only 20 minutes what's the shortest you know today we have all of these shorts and one minute videos and all as an expert what's the shortest period that you can practice where we will get some mental and physiological benefit 15 to 20 minutes 15 to 20 minutes of just pranay okay I'm not talking about meditation yoga ASAS that is not that so I'm a little confused over here when I think pranayama now I'm thinking oh I'm going to meditate and I'm going to link my thoughts and I'm going to meditate also so pranama just focus on breathing it's only your breath work so right now when you're sitting yeah okay so so can I read the newspaper and do pranayama you cannot actually do that so I need to be emptying my mind at that period technically yeah so I need need to have no distraction that's why you said don't take the phone exactly that is why I do that the first thing in the morning itself so you kind of recalibrating your body first thing in the morning it's like setting fine tuning it first thing in the morning exactly so the thing is right now we are we are living such busy lives and we as soon as we wake up the first things we do is actually check our phone check our notifications like what is our calendar for the day so you're saying check your breathing yeah check your mind yes take your yoga mat try and start at least with 15 minutes a day if you are not giving yourself the priority to do that 15 to 20 minutes of that practice in the morning how do you expect the rest of the day to work for you very powerful how do you expect the rest of the day to work for you if you're not respecting your body exactly powerful words for miruna over here so you're doing the pranayama you're doing the yoga but now I'm confused because somewhere in my head meditation is floating okay so so put the dots together for all of us who are uninitiated into this practice all right let me just tell you about the rest of my day what I usually do and I'll come to the meditation part as well so as soon as I'm done with my pranama I do couple of Arenas which are targeted towards my specific needs now this is not something which I have usually shared with people actually in fact people don't know but I have actually had a thyroid issue for very long and I am practicing pranama specifically to treat that and manage that and I've actually got it under control by myself without any medication wow right only through pranayam breathing only through the ASAS so there are certain pranam techniques which Target your thyroid gland which Target your neck right as well as ASAS these inversion ASAS where you do sarvangasana you see people doing the shoulder stand right they put their legs completely up it targets your thyroid gland so depending on what you want to work on or do you want to work on your overall Wellness right you target you do the specific pranam or ASAS for that so once that is done I come down and I have my lemon water everyone knows why lemon water is absolutely beautiful now people think that having lemon water tends to increase the acidity in your stomach but when it's mixed with your saliva it goes inside and becomes alkaline it's very good for detoxification have my meals and towards the evening that is when I do my meditation right PanAm is different it works on your breath it works on your stress levels it works on certain conditions that you might have right but meditation is more of the connection that you have with yourself you know there are a lot of people Ryan who go and look for answers outside right you could go to a temple you could go to someone who is very well very knowledgeable right you might go to different places for answers but truly with meditation what happens is it it forces you to look into yourself the answer is always closest to home we ask the questions which are very further away but meditation teaches you to ask the questions closest to home and when you ask that you will be able to get the answers which are further away right so it is a discipline I would say where you sit some meditation you have different forms of meditation itself right you could do and this you do in this you do in the E evening time this this is my self- practice that I do in the evening okay right so you can do meditation in the morning as well that is what is generally preferred however I have these certain habits which I have set for myself I do my pranam and yoga in the morning evening I do my meditation always make sure you have an empty stomach so post lunch 3 4 hours post lunch is always the best time to do the meditation so either you can do your own chanting or you can just focus on your breath so when you breathe in it sounds like so H hum H so you can focus on that so and hum right you could do that or you could do the chakra meditation that is we have seven chakras in the body you set the intention for each of the chakra and you there are certain mantras for each chakra that we chant out loud so those are different ways as well to balance your chakra so this is the different these are the different ways in which you can do meditation anyone can pick up anything that best suits them in meditation they say clear your mind now somebody like me who tries to clear the mind I'm thinking apples blueberries cherries this diet counseling that diet counseling this celebrity that celebrity and I can't clear my mind it doesn't rest so any tips for that okay that's a beautiful question and actually that is something that happens to everyone in fact oh it happens to everybody of course it happens to everybody oh I just thought my brain is wasn't wired to shut down absolutely not we all have a monkey mind right right have monkey mind I like that term that's exactly where my mind goop oop oop here and there and everything yeah exactly and why is that is because our brain always wants these distractions it wants these distractions it wants different things to get stimulated by at all points of time that is why we are so addicted to Reels that is why we're so addicted to shorts because we're getting that do mean that our brain wants that happiness in a very short amount of time we all have monkey brains so we need to get from Monkey Brains to meditation brains India are you listening in monkey brain to meditation brain that's what we need to do says miruna all right so let me tell you what you can do on a daily basis in a very simple way right can you start with doing one minute every day absolutely absolutely right that is that you don't even need to put any effort so I started one minute set the intention for one minute today H next week can you increase it to 2 minutes right I can absolutely possible and another way to also train your brain is while you are doing something are you doing something else also along with it while you are drinking your tea are you looking at your phone or can you just drink your tea by only focusing on your tea and completely enjoying it in that moment that is also meditation right I am taking a one minute break and meditating into my cup of tea right now but that's an amazing thought break it down into a smaller goal cuz I always thought I had to meditate for 1 hour and after 30 seconds I'm like I can't do this it's just too long I got to get back to my pods and real cast and this and that and everything so 1 minute is your recommendation per week go to 2 minutes the next week and build from there take your time so you can increase 1 minute a day you can increase 1 minute a week that is up to you what you can do on a regular basis is train your mind as you doing your daily activities right when you are washing the dishes are you listening to music music and washing the dishes or can you just do that on your own by only focusing on these dishes right we are constantly training our brain to focus on this one activity so that when you sit for that meditation practice in the evening it is easier for you to focus on your breath or focus on whatever intention you are setting at that point and so how long do you do your meditation I do it for 20 minutes and that's about it because in the morning I will have about 1 hour of fan am my Asa do even when you do your ASAS it is some form of meditation because you're focusing on the posture you're focusing on your breath that's why my yoga instructor always keeps saying focus on your breath when I'm actually focusing on a diet chart when I'm doing Mas now definitely we all very busy right right you're very busy so I think that W that we give our body every day which is kind of I think 4% of the day um is respecting the body uh recalibrating the mind recalibrating the muscles and in your case controlling even your thyroid recalibrating the thyroid using breath using your thoughts so powerful thoughts powerful thoughts and are you an early dinner person in your routine absolutely so I complete my dinner at 7 at Max if there is some obstacle in the way my Max is 8:00 and that's it and I will probably go to bed at 11:00 and I wake up at 6:30 that is my daily routine so why eating very early is important in fact the one biggest change you will see is you'll start to lose weight in fact you'll start to lose fat because what happens is when you eat early your body will anyway take those 3 to 4 hours to digest the food and the rest 6 to 7 hours your body is only focusing on detoxifying detoxification from inside cleaning we go out for these detox juices these detox diet and drinks no you don't even need that just have an early dinner just have an early dinner complete it have a well balanced dinner right that is more than enough it doesn't even have to be as complicated it's so simple right these are these small small simple ways in which you're helping your body become better from inside right so so I'm very enamored that you're talking about thyroid and your working on the breath and the ASAS to to help it and it's succeeded for you and I know a lot of yogic and gurus who have done this and it works for them and therefore as a nutritionist as a health coach I like to encourage my clients to bring that into their practice now a lot of people that follow you and a lot of people that follow me have very sedentary lives where desk jockies we sit at a desk and we work we use our brains we use our fingers a few tips from you about the yoga positions that we can focus on and uh some that can help people because they're not moving okay so this entire concept of sedentary life came into picture only over the past 30 to 40 years there wasn't even a concept or knowledge about sedentary life especially in the time of our grandfathers right that was the Industrial Revolution manufacturing SE sector they were always out and about they were always walk in of course they had different stress that was going on but now it's the Scientific Revolution the technological Revolution right right we are forced to sit down our bodies are meant to move we are built to move and when we don't do that we see a list of issues that is inside couple of people who definitely need that are people with arthritis as you know that arthritis when you have two bones which are joined together you have the synovial fluid around it when you do not move the circulation of that fluid reduces and it worsens your pain that is why arthritis patients need to walk Di diabetics as well because they need to expend that glucose that is there in your blood small things you can do on a daily basis now one ASA which is very powerful is your ad mukas Swan ASA that is your downward facing dog so these ASAS which I'm telling you is for people who do not have enough Mobility do not have enough flexibility even people who are older can do this and start it off right so first one is your Adas Swan Asana that's your downward facing dog what it does is it strengthens your hamstrings strengthens your calves improves the flexibility of those regions as well as it improves the circulation to your brain so what this does is it helps you with your brain functions as well strengthens your shoulders a very simple ASA that you can do and how long should you hold this ASA hold it for one minute okay and how many times should I do it do it around three to four times that's more and in between the ASA what should I do go back to child's pose so as you are doing the ASA right you need to go back as you are resting you go back to the inversion of that pose okay right so Adas swanana you are in that downward facing dog you are in the inversion right opposite of that is your child pose so you go back to that child pose and rest right so that is one that one thing that you can do another one is virabhadrasana that is Warrior B POS right this is something that a lot of people have heard very simple you don't even need to put an effort for this pose but what is so beautiful is it strengthens your arms strengthens your shoulders and improves the flexibility of your hips so there are a lot of people who tend to lose this out when they get older right they find it difficult to move that is it because we sitting at the desk all the time so the hip flexors shorten up and stuff that right so that kind of opens it up opens it up right so this is also something which is very simple that you can do right on either side on the left side and on the right side so it's called The Warrior B pose another one that you can do is bujang gasana that is your Cobra pose right so what this does really well is it improves the flexibility of your spine now cuz we always sitting at the desk every day like that exactly exactly so it improves that it improves the upper respiratory system as well improves the strength of your wrist now people face a lot of issues with their wrist also right when they grow old the knee KN and the wrist is something that is first affected I feel like that is also something that works on your wrist was it because it puts some pressure there it helps you in the mobility of your R do you feel that if you start in your 20s and 30s these yoga ASAS these three that you mentioned uh it has a long-term effect in your old age as in it really helps them out so it's a mixture of a lot of things right when you are practicing your breathing right when you are practicing your ASAS that is when you start it off early you will definitely reap the results towards the end why I'm asking this question is a majority of my clients that come to me are in the 45 Plus Age category so they have done the hard work sedentary work working in the office you know climbing the corporate ladder getting successful ignoring their health ignoring their body and when I do meet youngsters 20 to 40 I keep telling them I meet the 40s to 70s and the one thing that they say is can I go back in time and change my health okay so you're a young lady you do this as a profession do you think that the Young Generation will get a better benefit in starting yoga in their 20s and 30s or 30s and 40s or they can start it later on in their life once they retired so here's the thing right let's take the example of money okay when you take money you are saving let's say 1,000 rupees every month starting now starting at your 20s right and you are constantly deposit depositing that into an FD or your stocks your sips whatever it is towards the end you probably have Financial Freedom by the time you're 40 that's what happens right whereas when you start at 40 you need a higher Capital that's me it's 40 I started saving so now I have lesser bank balance than a 25 year old today because a 20-year-old started so you're saying do a sip for yoga and breath and meditation exactly you will see yourself aging very slowly so people wonder right why yoga gurus or teachers they look so young it is because we are practicing these things from inside not just on the mat people think that yoga is about practicing this pranaa ASAS for that 1 hour on the mat but it is not just that it is about how you live the rest of the day as well when you are eating when you are sitting do you have the intention of just focusing on your food and are you sitting up straight now why this is very important is that when you're sitting up straight and when you're eating your food your breathing automatically goes into your stomach whereas when you're sitting a little crunched or hunched your stomach is constricted now the breathing automatically goes into your chest so what your body thinks is it's in a state of stress as it is breathing in your chest your body moves into to a parasympathetic state of mind and the food that you eat is not digested well or the glucose is always in your bloodstream whereas when you breathe through your stomach you're telling your body that I am in a state of rest and digest please take the food that is there utilize it well for the cells to function when you are breathing every part of the day are you in a constant state of stress where you breathing through your chest you know a lot of my students have told me that yes mirina I'm mostly breathing out of my chest it is right it is necessary but are you allowing your body to go back to that state of relaxation after that that is what is very important this is why knowing this understanding this knowledge understanding how to implement that in your body in the right ways will automatically help you look better feel better in fact yogis do not really need that much food you see people they are barely eating they will eat so little food they will barely need anything for their sustenance why it is because even what they are eating is enough to energize them the pranayama that they practicing every single day is enough to energize them that's life force energy basically for you so speaking of Life Force we both live in one of the most happening cities in the world with a lot of life in it there's a lot of force in it uh and so let's talk about our beautiful city of Bangalore um you know and there are a lot of issues that are happening for us and I believe the younger generation is the generation that's going to lead us to the better development of our cities and the world so let's take a few holistic health things you know we live with hard water and you're a person who influences a lot of youngsters what's your advice we live with hard water any tips from miruna okay so first we need to understand what hard water even is it is of course the calcium and magnesium salts that are present in water now why this is really bad is you will see an immediate difference when you wash your hair your hair becomes dry it becomes brittle it starts to fall a lot in fact I had done uh hair coloring and bleaching in another city came to Bangalore and I'm not joking within 2 weeks my hair started to look like a broomstick it became so bad so it is very bad for colored hair as well this hard water right so how simple ways in which you can test whether your building has hard water or not so this will be again dependent on the water supply that you have right depends on the areas depends on the buildings where you're getting your water from a simple way to test it is take a clean water bottle a clear water bottle put half of it with water and put a clear soap any sort of liquid soap right just shake it well if the entire half the other half of that water bottle has soap bubbles right then your water is soft water it is good for your hair but most of our Waters we will see the soap is just a very thin layer on top of the water that is when you know it's hard water or you see your utensils you see your shower faucets they're all salt salt marks exactly those white deposits and I tend I used to think that those white deposits were soap the soap that you used to clean your dishes right I thought it was that but in fact it was the water so those are the small ways in which you can see whether you have hard water or soft water and how you can overcome that so one thing that I started to do in Bangalore I is I started to wash my hair lesser you don't need to be washing your hair every two days not needed there are some people who wash their hair every day why do you want to subject your hair through so many chemicals so much uh of these salts every single day it's not required in fact over time I trained my hair to I train my hair in such a way that I just need to wash it twice a week before before I wash my hair I soak it in oil really well those disgusting smelly oils that you get from your hometown the ones that you used to shy away from or I used to think what is my dad even applying on his hair the entire house smells so bad those are the best oils unfortunately not the ones which smell very beautiful right so I soak it on my hair for a good four to 5 hours take a head wash only twice a week and have these shampoos which don't do not have these harsher chemicals right which do not not have sodium Laurel sulfate sodium laal sulfate parabens all of that because those tend to dry your hair and when they dry your hair you think I need to apply conditioner so I'll share my secret with you so my wife also has frizzy hair she's like do something about the hard water you're a famous nutritionist I'm like I'm not the water supply guy right so what I did is I went and did a little bit of research and on the Sha head you can actually put a filter a water softening filter so there's a company called water science okay that develops these filters so every 6 months I put in a new filter and that filter is actually um particles of they look like salt crystals so apparently it bonds with the salts of calcium magnesium and other salts and holds it back and you get a softer water yeah so unless you go for a really good company like that it works whereas initially I went to Amazon and just checked what is the most reviewed researched whatever I picked that and it did not work at all so in fact what I started to do is um I started to use the filter water the that you get for drinking I have many of my clients celebrity actors and actresses who do that and so they have the normal shower but then the last rinse exactly the one or two liters is done with a softer water or a water that is uh ph balanced for their hair yeah so that is also something that I do once I'm done with the entire wash towards the end I have this entire jug where I just dunk my entire head in the filtered water that is I would say not very environment friendly probably but if you have severe hair loss then this is probably one of the best ways to go you know I've just got a thought in my head is like we talk about water um and the first thought that came to my head was plastic water bottles now we surrounded by a lot of microplastics what do you do Mar as meditation and yoga practition now you know Wellness is your main state so what do you do to reduce the Plastics in your life okay well there are two ways in which you can approach this one is to reduce your exposure towards it and the second is to make your body or enhance your body's natural detoxification mechanism right so the first thing is your synthetic textiles that is that produces 38% of the world's microplastics whe Believe It or Not wow synthetic textiles only why is because when you provide this kind of abration when you rub against it when you put it in the washing or the dryer that friction that is created releases these polyester Fabrics into the air or onto your skin or you could probably ingest it you never know right whereas when you look at these natural fibers made out of of cotton hemp jute whatever it is they are bigger so even when the friction happens they tend to Clump up together and it's big enough for you to realize that okay I've inhaled something else inside of me and those actually will not cause any kind of endocrine disruption or anything as such in your body whereas synthetic fibers is one of the largest so switching to natural cotton natural fibers is always one of the best options another thing is your cosme ICS believe it or not one of the lipsticks that I actually had had the word polyethylene in the ingredients that's used in um wind uh to prevent the wind screens from frosting up yeah a lot of these Plastics have that right all these plastic was in lipstick yes so you're putting it in you're swalling it every day exactly and not I never thought about lipsticks yeah and women whether they use a foundation whether they use you know blush kajel whatever it is lipsticks are the biggest game changers I would say when it comes to like transforming your look lipsticks make or break your face I mean I love lipsticks in fact that is the one piece of makeup that I always use so so what would you advise all the women go for more organic uh um lipsticks are such things available I don't know about this yeah they are available but they are definitely little bit more expensive but isn't your body worth it right exactly because then you're putting Plastics directly into and you use the word endocrine disruptor so I'm assuming that in addition to microplastics all the other chemicals are also disrupting your system yeah exactly so is it possible for you to reduce the consumption of all of these synthetic products that are there outside not just your lipsticks so when you look at lipsticks you have polyethylene polypropylene these are the two major components which you should be avoiding in lipsticks not just lipsticks but any kind of Cosmetics right another thing would be looking at your daily consumption of plastics itself your Cho choing board right we are using I used to use the plastic chopping board and I used to use a very sharp knife it used to have all of these scratches did not bother at all and we used to cut the vegetables on that and we used to scratch it scrape it and push it onto the pot right and then we wonder how is it possible to have microplastics in our blood because we are directly consuming it every single day in fact it was even proven that the feces of babies had large amount of microplastic that were present than the mother because through the placenta it's going to the child through the breast milk it's going to the child probably through the feeding bottle or like whatever it is right it is there all of us have these microplastics in our blood so one thing is to reduce the consumption reduce our exposure to it and another thing is how do you detoxify from within right one thing would be to um of course do pran and breathing pranama there are these specific practices which you can do do which will detoxify yourself from inside improve your lung um strength remove the toxins from your blood as well that is why you see these people when they practice for a very long time their skin clears up their face will start glowing their hair will get stronger and you will wonder what are they doing Simple just pra right another thing would be can you sweat every single day how do you improve that sweat is a beautiful way of detoxifying from inside not just for plastic but also for the heavier metals also that are there right so that or even can you go to a sauna sauna where you have a lot of heat subjected to you right where you are increasing that sweat and finally it's just the regular thing of having a good amount of fruits and vegetables in your diet as well as water see our body itself is made up of 60% of water so we need to give that right kind of food which will help our body also detox from within and the food which has the maximum amount of water is fruits and vegetables so just increase your consumption of that and just allow your body to detoxify from within awesome and you know when we started the podcast you say you don't touch your phone you start off your pranayama and yoga practice first thing in the morning we all know about phones cellular radiation electromagnetic frequency EMF what's your thought process what's your take on this okay so with each phone before anyone work purchases the phone there is one specific value called s value s now this is an engineer first and then a yogic person telling us so saf is what we're looking for S value s yeah and where do we look for that so s value you will have to look at it online or you can probably ask the person who is selling you that so I want to buy a new phone right now so I go and say the model of the phone s rating s value value yeah so what this is is is called specific absorption rate now when you have a phone it emits your radio frequency right it is the amount of energy that our body per unit mass of our body absorbs these radio frequencies right and what we want to do so higher the value more bad or lower the value is more okay so your what is the safe limit that is been prescribed to everyone is 1.6 watts per kg in fact my phone has at 0.98 there are phones which have the value of 0.2 0.3 I'm telling my research team to find this phone the lowest possible s value guys I need to buy a new phone my batter is dying out find me the lowest s value right so what this does is even if it might be a non- ionizing radiation right this is something that has come into picture probably over the last 20 30 years there isn't enough evidence or there isn't enough research which has put into into this particular field which tells us exactly how it affects our body there are two sides to this but why would you want to take that risk in the first place so even if those phones might be slightly expensive can you possibly make a better choice for yourself there are phones which are at 1.9 which are very high even some people might gravitate towards that probably because of the cost but they do not realize that the radiations that these phones are emitting are so high right so that is one thing that you really need to look into a couple of things which you can do in Bangalore as someone who is working in your desk job you are constantly surrounded by these EMF radiations all around us right so small practices can you do that is distance yourself from these for a good amount of time in a day that is when I wake up tell yourself that you will not use these devices for probably one or two hours finish your sad finish your practice finish your meals and then go towards these devices can you reduce the amount of Bluetooth devices that are there also in your phone this is something that you've also spoken about right your Bluetooth headphones your Bluetooth speakers all of that can you change to a wired one instead can you put your phone on airplane mode before you sleep or rather can you create a bedroom in such a way that it is an EMF fre Zone put all of your devices in another room and have one room which is dedicated having no EMF radiation whatsoever right or can you reduce amount of of smart devices imagine a techie marrying a yoga instructor saying no technology in the bedroom that's going to be the first thing Young Generation jenz when you approach in shadi.com bharatmatrimony.com ask us of other person manour to keep the phones out of the bedroom computers out of the bedroom or not so here's the thing right there are these small small things that you can do on a regular basis it doesn't have to be something that is very extreme very drastic you have to find that kind of balance within right so these are the awesome awesome and um a lot of us are living in this beautiful city of Bangalore the Silicon capital of India and soon maybe we can say the Silicon capital of the world we'll take the crown from San Francisco but U everybody who's young and comes to the city lives in paying guest accommodation studio apartments what's your advice to the youngsters coming in from their college into this great City focusing on their job but maybe not focusing on their health okay so um there are a couple of things that they can definitely do one thing is focus on what you can rather add to your meal rather than remove from it so people say that yeah processed food is bad sugar having high amounts of sugar and salt is bad instead of looking at what you can remove from your meal can you look at what positives I can add to it that's an entire attitude shift that you must have from within so when I wake up right when I'm staying at my PG can I have a small nuts jar a nuts mix where I keep next to my bed where I break my fast in the morning with a couple of nuts and a fruit or have an omelette rather than heading out for your PG food which tends to be heavy on the simple carbohydrate side right make these small changes instead of reaching out for coffee a lot of people who live these fast-paced lives not just people who are living in pgs as well but people who are working professionals also coffee or tea is the first thing that they reach out to but we all know that that does not exactly like work in our favor and what you do is lemon water first so that's a good tip uh do you have people who are youngsters who stay in pgs that come to you to do pranayama and meditation and does that help people so can in addition to the Food Part change of attitude which is what you just said do something more positive to your food rather than only focus on elimination of foods is there anything that um you can prescribe to the pg people okay so with PG or with anyone living a very hectic lifestyle prioritize your self-care beyond anything else and that would be can you do something to keep your mental health in check in fact pranay and meditation is something that will absolutely do do that because one thing you see with people who live these fast-paced lives it is like running a marathon right it is not a Sprint at the end of the day in a marathon when you see towards the last few kilometers that is there every single Runner will always say it is a battle against your mind right so the one thing that you can do to overcome that is your self-care take care of yourself from within how are you doing that are you practicing pranayama in the morning just take 15 minutes right as we had said earlier 15 minutes of that practice in the morning have your nuts and seeds are you having a good variety of fruits vegetables your legumes your pulses your whole grains your nuts and seeds and a good amount of water these are the five basic things that you need even in nutrition itself that is all are you able to take care of all of that are you doing your sad to take care of your mental health if these two parts are taken care of in your body your body will do so much more for you and you will see that you will be able to do your work in such a happy way you will no longer see your work as such a burden right so having that attitude shift that mental shift is like very much needed awesome so uh you know some of us have children inside of us and we don't know how to take care of oursel but many people already have children what are some of the tips that you give parents for children that is actually very much needed what you said in fact children look up to their parents right ever since they are the smallest of kids as soon as they understand what is going on around them they want to copy their parents right you you see all these cute videos also going around the internet where children are having the same sleeping Styles Behavior styles of probably their father or their mother right so they want to copy them can you as a parent show your kid that you are going to the gym to work out can you show your kid that you're eating healthy rather than reaching out for a couple of drinks when you are stressed out in the day right so one thing that I would want to tell your parents is that try to involve your kid a lot in the healthier activities that you have right when you are doing your meal prep can you make your kids wash a couple of vegetables which may look very colorful and so beautiful these kids will be so excited by seeing that have a small platter where you have healthier snacks rather than reaching out to probably french fries or something now I see a lot of this happen happening not just with kids but even with adults right when we look at certain mental related stresses that we may have in the day if our day goes bad what do we do we reach out to comfort food and these Comfort Foods tends to be overly salty overly sugary overly fried why is that because these salty sugary oily they cause neuro excitement in us they give us that sort of pleasure right can you instead help your kid feel these same things with healthier food have just cut a couple of lady fingers and just bake it with just some salt and chili powder and it tastes so beautiful it is so much better than having a french fry right so associate your kid with having these snacks into these positive emotions they will when they face all these mental stress mental disorders whatever it might be when they are not feeling so good they will automatically gravitate towards better eating you know when I was uh when I was a kid in fact in school my mother used to give me lunch boxes which were a little bit annoying for me you know my friends used to bring Maggie they used to bring chicken nuggets and sausage and all of that and I was so jealous of them whereas my mother gave me a chapati she gave me Dal she gave me some vegetables which was so cumbersome they could eat with folks and spoons whereas I had to sit on the table and properly eat my food but because of the ways in which she brought me up that is what makes me who I am now when I reach out to comfort I reach out to these kind of foods rather than reaching out to process food yeah reaching out to an unhealthy lifestyle I'm not saying don't eat that eat that as well but where is the balance are you having that 8020 balance or not right that is what is more important and you know when you do this shopping for groceries and items and all what does miruna look for when she goes shopping you know for her health for her well-being for just the way she looks at life okay so this is actually something that is uh that is pretty funny when I go shopping I come with four huge bags of vegetables like you would not believe some friends of mine have also made fun of me saying you're like the vegetable uh vegetable vendor of you know our flat and all of that because I absolutely love vegetable I was not as fond of fruits as much but uh vegetables I would say that I would buy so much of vegetables what's your favorite vegetable that's very difficult um you have many of them I have many of them there's the only thing that I did not like was bitter guard but I found a way to love that as well so it's all in the preparation and the acceptance yeah how do you prepare your bitter God okay so um you will have to cut it from cut it like L wise remove the white portion out and slice it up probably put some salt little chili powder Hali and just shallow fry or bake it and that's it it becomes like crispy chips my mouth is already watering too it becomes these crispy chips which you can eat and it has like no oil also so you mentioned that Bindy could be done in the same way and and bitter good can be done in the same way so these vegetables have these natural flavors of their own we don't need to as Indians we tend to add so much spice so much Masala so much gravies to it it's not needed at all bring out its natural characteristics so Mir you come back with four shopping bags okay of vegetables let's say you're not buying vegetables okay and you're going to buy any products in the market or what are you looking at as a person who's into the Wellness category all right so when it comes to let's say um not vegetables I gravitate towards having let's say you pick up a box of musle for breakfast right A lot of people have cereals these grains oats whatever it might be for breakfast right even if you might be having something that is packaged I look at the back look at the ingredients list usually if it has like a very large ingredient list it tends to have a lot of these preservatives additives synthetic um flavors colors can you look at all of that and see whether they are healthy or not and usually it is listed in their volume ratio right the one that is produced or it is present the most is present in the beginning that will be the first couple of ingredients and then it goes to the whatever is present the least right so I look at that is it healthy or not yes no I purchase it right and look at the amount of sodium also that is present in that product right the amount of sodium that our body needs per day is only 5 G that is half a teaspoon whereas now if you see there are a lot of products which have have a lot of sodium so something like these processed Meats cured meats cheese even if I have that I make sure that I limit my daily intake so you know when you're looking at items you're looking at labels uh you're educating yourself and even if you're having something that could be sinful for your body you're looking at limitation exactly awesome ideas from Mira so one question AA is it practical in 2024 the entire concept or the entire question of it being being practical or not should never be a question when it comes to Aura itself right let's understand what that is even in the first place so ayurva talks about the balance of the doshas that are there in your body right so what are doas there are mainly three right three body types you have Vata you have PA you have kafa that everybody knows how do you identify who you are okay so if you see Vata people they will tend to be very lean very thin they will eat whatever they want and they will not not gain weight at all right exactly exactly so you will see these people tend to be very extroverted they will tend to make friends so easily yeah exactly but when you look at paa right I am more of a paa dominant person right I will tend to be a little bit more muscular in built whereas if you see kafa you will tend to be little bit on the heavier side right that is one way to identify who you are another thing as I said Vata people you're very extroverted P people we tend to be slightly conserv we'll be a little bit more calculative with who we meet who we talk we will think okay how do I go speak to this person you know what should I say so that he will be happy you know we will think a little bit more and we will approach that person also in a calculated way kafa people are very introverted okay look at the minds of these people vaata people you monkey mind right for you doing meditation is very important ah okay so you see how identifying who you are right you when you identify who you are you will get to know what exactly you're supposed to do to support your body type right people who are Bata dominant you should not be eating a lot of salads because it will come out of your body because the elements that are dominant in Vata is space and air it will not digest the raw food or the salads as much so having boiled vegetables is something that will support you much better whereas for me being pad dominant I will have to have more salads because the element of fire is very high in my so you have to calm it down calm it down very interesting very interesting so um there's one group of people that I feel need a lot of love and care which are teenage girls right we take ayura we take yoga we take meditation we get better hair we get better lipstick we get uh eating correctly so we have the the correct figure right what is your advice to teenage girls one thing which I will need not just teenage girls but the parents of them to understand is a lot of teenage girls they go through this very big transition in their lives when they attain puberty right that can be a very confusing time for most people right your body changes your hips start to grow larger you develop dress you start to look different you start to speak a little bit differently it's very confusing you know I still remember when my mother took me out to shop for a sports bra I was like CH what is this you know it was very weird you have to make that normal for the kid normal for that teenage girl you know educate her tell her why it is important right that is something that needs to come from the parent because if you are fifth if you are in fifth or sixth you do not have that maturity for yourself to do that right how much will you possibly go research even if you do you might be curious do you accept that from within that this is who this is what my body is this is that transition this is something that needs to come from the parent right you need to understand what are these sexual changes that are happening within you these hormones that are coming from within you will start to develop acne pimples you'll start to have hairfall these mood changes these mood swings what are these are these normal these are some things that you need to look at as well as a lot of these girls I see it's something that happened to me as well as soon as I attained puberty especially in India we don't tend to work out as much Sports is something that you drop off very normal right as parents can you encourage your girls to still continue not saying during those 3 days when we going through that pain during those 3 days I myself sit at home do not really do any work I do not subject myself to pranayama also I just sit there allow my body to you know heal from within and after those 3 days I continue my practice right can you allow them to do these physical activities continue it you'll have to support your girl as a parent just interrupting is there a chakra that is linked to the woman's menstruation cycle and then therefore is there an ASA that women can do during that period yeah so that is your sacral chakra that is there 1 in below your belly button right so there are couple couple of ASAS which you can do you can do the pigeon pose which is all these hip opening ASAS those are the ones which are very good malassa where you are sitting in a squatted position you know I see a lot of these older people can't even squat anymore in these Indian toilets these Indian traditional toilets that we had it's actually very good for hip opening right the malasa you have your pigeon pose all of that you can do so any sort of hip opening ASA is something that will really support that particular area and of course if you can do your Mantra chanting your meditation towards that particular chakra as well that will also help them awesome so you know we have talked about meditation we've talked about the mind we talked about the fire in the human body the asnas and even lipsticks being uh dangerous uh you know for from a from a microplastics point of view now I want to ask something which relates to you personally we'll do a rapid fire okay and you don't have to think too much we'll go quickly you give me your best in this okay we live in the city of Bangalore in my opinion the most happening place on the planet five top places to eat in Bangalore for miruna okay so I love uh Kera food so for kachen is one I love our uh Dosa MTR CTR amazing and when it comes to North Indian I love uh this daa estd that's also something that they have um and the fifth one would be all these Pan Asian places that are around I am actually a I love these Pan Asian uh Japanese food and Sushi and all of that so anything in that category also works for me awesome um your favorite location for holiday holiday you have one or you have many I think when it comes to a holiday more of these water-based Sports is something which I absolutely love you know sitting on the beach swimming in the water is something that I absolutely love in fact I used to swim also when I was in school so any of these water-based activities where you have the river flowing or you are sitting in the beach and just connecting with nature is something that I love so the mountains and the beach these two are usually like where I tend to gravitate to so you're looking for a water body next to either of these locations where you can enjoy a vacation yeah awesome four shopping bags of veggies again I'm going to ask you what are your top five veggies okay um rid guard uh bottle guard snake guard zucchini uh pumpkin uh you really love your vegetables because you're going uh and we already finished five you know she's a veggies lady beetroot or sweet potato which one would you marry sweet potato because I love sweet potato fries are the best awesome good answer your secret skincare routine all the girls out there want to know why you have such glowing and beautiful skin she's actually glowing on the podcast you can't see that on the camera the filter doesn't capture it what is your secret I know it's the pranayama now it's the breath what else one thing which a lot of people can look at is whether you have dandruff or not so dandruff will tend to cause a lot of acne and pimples also on your face true can you take care of that are you switching out your pillows on a regular basis right the pillow covers they tend to carry that bacteria also even if you might be going and washing your hair are you switching these out damn in 20 years of practice I never thought about this that is so logical that is so logical so what you should do switch your pillow covers take your entire pillow go hang it out in the sun the sun will kill all of that bacteria let's go pillow shopping everyone pillow for Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday to to combat uh dendra that's what miruna says so you now have your pillow cases labeled so you don't have infection frequently for the fungus or the bacteria that are there on your hair exactly and depending on your body type so since I was very P dominant I tend to have a lot of fire from inside I was getting a lot of these breakouts itself so can I have all of these salads reduce the amount of spices also I'm having reduce the oil that is there I was having very oily skin right so according to your body type can you supplement yourself accordingly in the right way with the foods with the pranayama have sufficient amount of water right which will remove all of this from inside so before we wind up a lot of us get wound up right stress we fight a lot you if You observe the world today people are arguing more people have very acerbic opinions we don't allow somebody else to Live and Let Live as a person that vibrates in the realm of ancient Indian practices what are some of the tips that you do you practice or you would advise people that follow you for them to come out of a stressed event of a fight with a loved one a fight with a colleague or you just basically stressed because somebody's mistreated you how do you come out from that very quickly all right so you will again as I had said earlier a lot of what we project outside tends to be how we are feeling internally you know no matter what the environment is like outside can you be that light from within we tend to look for that outside in fact rather right we want to satisfy ourselves by buying a good house a good uh car a good bike right can you find that light within yourself when you do that that is by connecting better with yourself through meditation that is healing yourself allowing yourself to not be as stressed anymore through your pranayam through your breathing when you're eating well allowing those positive energies to flow inside of you you become that Beacon of light within yourself and when you are faced all of these situations from outside you are there right for yourself you don't need to reach out to something that is external anymore you are that home from within powerful words miruna become the beacon of Light have your own internal battery of vibration and if I can summarize today's thing with you is have your own me time first thing in the morning walk your day through with mindful breathing eat lot of veggies okay focus on your skincare routine really well choose the products that you buy carefully by reading labels these are great
