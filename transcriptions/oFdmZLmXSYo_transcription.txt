you know my wife says I'm very insensitive dode did not eat correctly my wife's like how can you be so insensitive there is documented research from American prisons on violence and suicide they actually took two prison blocks in Brazil or America somewhere Australia I remember reading the scientific paper so they fed them omega-3 and removed the bad fats and uh a multivitamin another block they didn't do anything the incidences of violence came down by over 55% incidences of suicidal tendency dropped almost 90% so when I see employees sad in an organization maybe it's the stimulus of the people around them but what if it's biological what if the fault is that you're not eating correctly what is it if the fault is that you do not know that your grandmother and grandfather did the wrong Jordy and brought into your family an omega-3 deficient Gene
