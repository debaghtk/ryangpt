hey guys if you're not able to watch my long form content of podcast here are some short form clips for you to enjoy somebody asked me I always face constipation and bloating though I'm a vegetarian so the assumption is vegetarians are holier than thou and I always face constipation and bloating though I'm a vegetarian meaning what vegetarian is Untouchable in the gut system and I eat out once in a while so first things Dr Paul constipation what is it and bloating what is it and do vegetarians also get her T part okay so uh the most common cause of constipation is lack of fiber intake okay okay and also lack of water intake usually what we tell my patients whenever the patients coming with constipation is the first thing is increase your water and take to minimum 2 lit of water per day and then increase your fiber big time at least 25 G of fiber per day and that's a lot until you consciously include it you are not going to get it uh based on the current uh eating habits and then the most common cause of bloating is constipation because the poop is held back in the gut usually you know uh there disregulation of the brain gut axis and there's a development of bad gut bacteria in we call this as sometimes chronic idiopathic constipation or irritable bubble syndrome of constipation but regardless there is this disbiosis where there is brain cxis is disregulated I know talking medical options speaking of medical op options was there ever a case where you just told a person drink more water and it cured them to be honest that is the treatment but people think that I need to give the medications only then they will be reassured okay good this is a good doctor and obviously you know we recommend people to drink water as a doctor how do you prescribe water uh is there a magical uh way that you do it or anything like that yeah yes I do I do so you know even my personality and also my education is usually not theoretical so I always do practical uh ways to and trips and I share that with my patient so we calculate eight glasses of water per day so I tell them to drink one glass before meals and one glass after meal breakfast lunch dinner six glasses and then one glass at 10:00 a.m. morning snack and then p.m. snack you're all done awesome advice staying with the same thing one of our followers asked us can de dehydration lack of water cause stomach cramps oh yes you know uh so see I in my channel as well always have been promoting hormonal balance correct circadian rhythm and there are only like few major important hormones that we need to be really considerate one is the you know insulin melatonin cortisol um three major hormones that I absolutely worship and love and everybody should love worship as well so these hormones love water ah so you know when you you give water they just like they having a party out there they're not grumpy ah they're basically swimming in the pool um so basically you increase the quality of these hormones by providing them water for the uninitiated to stomach cramp what be the easiest way we could describe what is stomach cramping uh stomach because females say like I got cramps right and then here somebody's talking about a gut cramp correct and then verat kohi gets a calf cramp so as a doctor can you kind of give us like a Layman opinion of is it a knife poking us or somebody socking you in the gut what is it like so cramps itself is a muscular contraction correct where it happens in cal It's skeletal muscle contraction when it happens in the gut it's smooth muscle contraction oh we have muscles in the gut gut is nothing but muscle as well so could I train that like a gym training uh like you know how I go to the gym and train my bicep could I train my stomach muscles also by eating good food which and P fiber that is the exercise for the stomach oh so that's the exercise for the stomach eat correctly eat correctly and not do this in the kitchen so no stomach crunches as doctor says U and speaking further we're going to talk only about B followers one somebody asked us is syum husk or what we call in India as isab Gul good for gut bacteria can I consume it every day so selan pasque is a wonderful option we also um give it to all my patients in uh us as well it comes with a brand called matam musil um the idea behind that is as we talked about fiber is absolutely critical for the gut uh in our modern days era we don't get enough fiber so we add this fiber supplements but the problem is we need to add it very slowly because every individual is different so sometimes fiber can precipitate abdominal bloating so most of the times what happens is I take ask them to take celum mask they take one day and then they get bloated and they like you know doctor is not good let's go to a different doctor oh so you should talk very very slowly sometimes you might be able to even take two to three capsules that you'll be surprised sometimes you'll be able to eat only one or even better is forget about celum Basque and just take fiber through natural sources until you reach 25 G of fiber per day minimum so 25 G of fiber is the key thing try and find it from natural sources I think the human race wants more convenience of a powder or pill and they're not willing to go back and check what are the foods which have fiber and how can I take that at my daily time correct but uh but you know it's a long process even I myself didn't know what was the fiber content in multiple food ingredients so educating Yourself by seeing Ryan's channel in terms of how much fiber is there in every ingredient uh slowly and steadily what happens is that even without your knowledge you will start incorporating all these ingredients so you do a lot of colonoscopies and endoscopy so you put a camera in and you check people's guts both from top down and bottom up correct when people eat really good or have good fiber are you as a doctor able to see a good gut and a bad gut absolutely yes so when we put the camera down we can see how inflamed how angry the stomach is you can see that yeah absolutely when we put a camera so that means people because they can't see something they're not able to link that they are slapping their gut correct but they slapping it inside ah so that's the dangerous part so it's too late sometimes before they come to you and not too late uh I mean to a point that yes regarding terms of symptoms yes you know it's too late that what are the symptoms we should look for like what are the symptoms I should look at or our follower should look for so that we don't have to put a camera down our throat or up a butt so uh there are two parts to that okay so the up your butt is colonoscopies yes and I do that when patient don't have any symptoms at all ah okay expand please doctor so it's a screening procedure why should we do screening so in United States when you turn 50 the medical insurance pays me to do the colonoscopies on every patient and what are we looking for we're looking for growths inside the colon we call it as colon pops what are these polyps these are like similar to skin growths it can grow inside the colon based on your genetic predisposition what you are eating lack of fiber lack of physical activity obesity all these are risk factors for formation of these precancerous colon polyps and these screenings that you do doctor on these 50 plus people have you found people who you have saved their lives absolutely I mean this is my date I'm a superhero on a daily basis wow wow wow so sticking with the gut and I'm going to come back to this colonoscopy and endoscopy uh I think in a lot we got like about 25 or 30% of people asking this one question which is hey guys if you've enjoyed this
