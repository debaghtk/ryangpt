[0.08 - 5.80] every Champion has a genetic code every
[3.12 - 7.60] one of us have a genetic code
[5.80 - 10.12] understanding this genetic code and
[7.60 - 12.60] interpreting it to our environment is
[10.12 - 14.28] the key to understanding how you need to
[12.60 - 17.60] change your behavior whether it's for
[14.28 - 20.52] Sleep diet or exercise in 2010 when we
[17.60 - 23.08] started genetic testing specifically
[20.52 - 25.52] nutrigenomics the science of
[23.08 - 28.92] understanding how your food impacts your
[25.52 - 30.44] genetics was conducted we were trolled
[28.92 - 33.08] we were told that this science is a
[30.44 - 35.28] pseudo science almost a decade later we
[33.08 - 38.24] are the pioneers and the leading clinic
[35.28 - 40.72] in the country for nutren testing where
[38.24 - 43.20] we have helped hundreds of superstars
[40.72 - 45.28] and athletes win Olympic medals break
[43.20 - 48.56] Guinness World Records and get in the
[45.28 - 50.16] fittest shape of their life all because
[48.56 - 52.44] understanding their personal genetic
[50.16 - 55.36] code allowed them to understand the
[52.44 - 57.96] nutrition plan the Sleep plan or the
[55.36 - 60.32] exercise plan that they received was not
[57.96 - 63.04] something that was marketed of pushed
[60.32 - 65.76] upon them but it was their own unique
[63.04 - 68.24] prescribed pattern to their genetic code
[65.76 - 71.72] now if you want to know more about how
[68.24 - 74.08] epigenetics that's how the world or the
[71.72 - 77.40] environment or the diet or the exercise
[74.08 - 79.24] or the Sleep acts upon your genetics
[77.40 - 81.12] then watch this video further as I
[79.24 - 83.48] explain the science to you in a little
[81.12 - 86.20] bit of a high school mode but not too
[83.48 - 88.84] technical once you understand this you
[86.20 - 90.92] become the master of your destiny by
[88.84 - 93.92] understanding your Gene code and how do
[90.92 - 96.32] you behave with it hey this video might
[93.92 - 98.64] be a little bit geeky and scientific but
[96.32 - 101.96] if you stick till the end I will be
[98.64 - 104.56] revealing some of my unique foods and
[101.96 - 107.16] secrets that will help you and you can
[104.56 - 109.80] modify your genetic outcomes for a
[107.16 - 112.16] healthier fitter you in the future so
[109.80 - 113.88] sit back and enjoy the entire video till
[112.16 - 115.96] the end as the country's leading
[113.88 - 118.04] nutritionist have spent years dwelling
[115.96 - 120.60] into the intricate connections between
[118.04 - 122.56] diet and health one of the most
[120.60 - 124.40] fascinating and revolutionary fields of
[122.56 - 127.32] study that has emerged in the recent
[124.40 - 129.48] years is epigenetics now if you not
[127.32 - 132.28] heard about this this Cutting Edge
[129.48 - 135.64] science explores how our lifestyle
[132.28 - 138.04] choices particularly our diet and how it
[135.64 - 141.52] can influence the
[138.04 - 144.28] expression of our genes without altering
[141.52 - 148.04] the underlining DNA sequence in simpler
[144.28 - 150.60] terms what you eat can turn certain
[148.04 - 152.88] genes on or off
[150.60 - 155.72] and potentially this affects your Health
[152.88 - 159.00] and Longevity so let's dive into the
[155.72 - 161.64] Incredible World of epigenetics and
[159.00 - 164.08] discover the foods that can shape your
[161.64 - 166.04] genetic Destiny epigenetics is a
[164.08 - 168.88] fascinating and rapidly evolving field
[166.04 - 172.12] of science that examines how gene
[168.88 - 174.52] expression can be altered without
[172.12 - 177.16] actually changing the underlining DNA
[174.52 - 180.04] sequence essentially while a genetic
[177.16 - 183.80] code the sequence of nucleotides in our
[180.04 - 186.00] DNA remains fixed epigenetic
[183.80 - 188.88] modifications determine how the genes
[186.00 - 191.24] are turned on or off like a dimmer
[188.88 - 194.76] switch adjusting the brightness of a
[191.24 - 197.60] light how epigenetic works the key
[194.76 - 201.28] mechanisms of epigenetic Regulation
[197.60 - 203.80] include DNA methylation the process
[201.28 - 207.36] there's an addition of a methy group to
[203.80 - 210.52] the DNA typically at the cytosine basis
[207.36 - 212.36] they affect methylation can silenced
[210.52 - 215.84] genes preventing them from being
[212.36 - 219.56] expressed for example tumor suppressor
[215.84 - 222.48] genes may be turned off in cancer cells
[219.56 - 226.28] through hyper metalation another one
[222.48 - 229.04] hisone modification process histones are
[226.28 - 231.24] proteins around which DNA is wound
[229.04 - 233.92] chemical modifications such as
[231.24 - 236.32] acetalation methylation and
[233.92 - 239.76] phosphorilation can alter the histone
[236.32 - 242.64] structure what's the effect these mod
[239.76 - 245.48] mod ifications can either loosen or
[242.64 - 246.88] tighten the DNA histone interaction
[245.48 - 249.36] actually affecting your Gene
[246.88 - 252.80] accessibility and expression for
[249.36 - 254.76] instance acetalation usually relaxes the
[252.80 - 257.44] chromatin structure moting gene
[254.76 - 261.36] expression non-coding RNA molecules
[257.44 - 264.84] process small RNA molecules such as
[261.36 - 269.00] micro rnas called miras and long
[264.84 - 272.44] non-coding rnas can interact with mRNA
[269.00 - 275.24] to regulate gene expression
[272.44 - 278.40] posttranscriptionally the effect these
[275.24 - 281.40] RNA molecules can degrade mRNA or
[278.40 - 284.44] inhibit its translation thus controlling
[281.40 - 287.12] the levels of protein produced by genes
[284.44 - 289.64] now what are the triggers of epigenetic
[287.12 - 292.80] changes epigenetic changes can be
[289.64 - 295.84] influenced by various environmental
[292.80 - 299.72] factors throughout a person's life and
[295.84 - 302.24] these include diet nutrients and body
[299.72 - 305.40] bioactive compounds and food can
[302.24 - 309.28] directly impact epigenetic mechanisms
[305.40 - 313.12] for example folate or the vitamin B9
[309.28 - 314.68] found in leafy greens is crucial for DNA
[313.12 - 317.48] methylation
[314.68 - 319.84] processes stress is another form from
[317.48 - 322.88] the environment chronic stress can lead
[319.84 - 325.92] to epigenetic modifications that affect
[322.88 - 328.08] the brain function and behavior
[325.92 - 331.12] potentially increasing the risk of
[328.08 - 334.04] mental health disorders and number three
[331.12 - 336.76] is exposure to toxins environmental
[334.04 - 340.28] pollutants and chemicals such as tobacco
[336.76 - 343.52] smoke and heavy metals can cause
[340.28 - 345.68] detrimental epigenetic changes linked to
[343.52 - 348.20] diseases like cancer and neurod
[345.68 - 351.00] degenerative disorders another one
[348.20 - 353.24] surprisingly physical activity regular
[351.00 - 356.08] exercise has been shown to induce
[353.24 - 358.24] beneficial epigenetic changes promoting
[356.08 - 360.52] genes involved in muscle growth and
[358.24 - 362.76] metabolic Health sleep sleep I was
[360.52 - 365.60] waiting to get to this one quality sleep
[362.76 - 368.64] is essential for maintaining health and
[365.60 - 371.16] epigenetic patterns which can influence
[368.64 - 373.80] immune function and cognitive Health the
[371.16 - 376.20] impact of epigenetics on your health and
[373.80 - 378.92] aging the ability of epigenetics to
[376.20 - 381.12] alter gene expression has profound
[378.92 - 383.84] implications for health and disease
[381.12 - 386.80] here's how it can affect various aspects
[383.84 - 390.04] of our life for me the first one is
[386.80 - 392.52] chronic diseases epigenetic modification
[390.04 - 395.80] are linked to developments of conditions
[392.52 - 398.20] such as cancer even diabetes
[395.80 - 400.92] cardiovascular diseases and most of the
[398.20 - 403.60] autoimmune disorders for instance
[400.92 - 406.72] aberant that is denatured DNA
[403.60 - 409.52] methylation patterns can activate enco
[406.72 - 411.96] genes cancer genes or silence tumor
[409.52 - 413.00] suppressor genes this contributes to
[411.96 - 415.88] cancer
[413.00 - 418.96] progression another one is aging we all
[415.88 - 422.36] age aging is associated with global
[418.96 - 425.04] changes in the entire DNA methylation
[422.36 - 427.40] and histone modifications now these
[425.04 - 429.72] changes can really affect the genes that
[427.40 - 432.60] are involved in cellular repair
[429.72 - 434.72] metabolism and inflammation also
[432.60 - 437.32] accelerating the aging process and
[434.72 - 439.24] increasing the susceptibility to age
[437.32 - 441.36] related diseases well you would say
[439.24 - 444.24] that's called Aging but it's linked
[441.36 - 446.68] inside your DNA now mental health
[444.24 - 450.00] epigenetic changes in brain can
[446.68 - 453.52] influence mood the behavior and
[450.00 - 456.12] cognitive function stress trauma and
[453.52 - 458.80] lifestyle factors can all induce
[456.12 - 460.68] epigenetic modifications that contribute
[458.80 - 463.84] to psychiatric disorders such as
[460.68 - 466.32] depression anxiety and schizophrenia
[463.84 - 469.04] development epigenetics plays a crucial
[466.32 - 471.80] role in development right from the
[469.04 - 474.84] embryonic stages right up through
[471.80 - 477.08] adulthood for example did you know that
[474.84 - 479.84] maternal nutrition and environmental
[477.08 - 482.92] exposures can cause significant
[479.84 - 485.08] epigenetic changes that actually affect
[482.92 - 488.16] the fetal development and long-term
[485.08 - 490.32] Health outcomes so what you eat how you
[488.16 - 491.92] think and how you behave is so important
[490.32 - 494.12] when you're carrying that child in your
[491.92 - 496.16] womb the power of nutrition in
[494.12 - 499.16] epigenetics now this is my subject
[496.16 - 502.16] matter nutrition plays a crucial role in
[499.16 - 504.80] all epigenetic modifications certain
[502.16 - 507.36] foods contain bioactive compounds that
[504.80 - 509.84] can modify the epigenome leading to
[507.36 - 513.36] beneficial Health outcomes these
[509.84 - 516.20] compounds can activate or silence
[513.36 - 517.84] specific genes potentially reducing the
[516.20 - 521.08] risk of diseases such as cancer
[517.84 - 523.80] cardiovascular disease and diabetes now
[521.08 - 527.20] I've got a list of eight foods that are
[523.80 - 529.24] proven with epigenetic effects and my
[527.20 - 532.44] list goes as follows broccoli and
[529.24 - 536.08] crucifers vegetables contain sulfurane
[532.44 - 539.60] and indol 3 carbinol now this has
[536.08 - 542.28] profound epigenetic effects and they can
[539.60 - 545.20] activate tumor suppressor genes and
[542.28 - 547.88] detoxifying enzymes reducing the risk of
[545.20 - 549.80] cancer in fact broccoli micr greens is
[547.88 - 551.84] my number one prescription at my qua
[549.80 - 554.40] nutrition clinics if you can get it done
[551.84 - 556.32] it reduces the risk of cancer second
[554.40 - 558.44] best person that I love is green tea and
[556.32 - 560.76] I drink it every day it contains a
[558.44 - 563.56] compound known as epig galico caken
[560.76 - 566.48] galate egcg I memorize this from my
[563.56 - 569.12] master's degree in Biochemistry egcg can
[566.48 - 571.64] modify DNA methylation patterns and I'll
[569.12 - 573.96] be drinking it since my medical days
[571.64 - 575.84] because it lowers the risk of cancer
[573.96 - 578.00] improves cardiovascular health even
[575.84 - 580.28] crosses the eye barrier to improve your
[578.00 - 583.32] eye Health now we all know about this
[580.28 - 585.00] compound turmeric hethy contains active
[583.32 - 589.16] compound and you've heard about it
[585.00 - 591.28] curcumin and these inhibit the histone
[589.16 - 594.16] deacetylases and the enzyme that can
[591.28 - 596.92] silence tumor suppressing genes thereby
[594.16 - 599.44] potentially preventing cancer which is
[596.92 - 601.72] why dadima was right in adding hethy to
[599.44 - 604.40] almost every beverage new to this part
[601.72 - 606.48] of the world are berries we have our
[604.40 - 608.08] Indian goose Berry and every other Berry
[606.48 - 611.00] that you can think about now they
[608.08 - 614.32] contain allic acid and
[611.00 - 617.16] antoin the epigenetic effect of these
[614.32 - 619.12] compounds can inhibit DNA methy
[617.16 - 621.44] transferases the enzymes that are
[619.12 - 623.76] involved in DNA methylation you can
[621.44 - 627.04] think of DNA getting attacked leading to
[623.76 - 630.72] reduced cancer risk so berries are like
[627.04 - 633.00] anti-rust to your DNA molecules nuts the
[630.72 - 635.72] compounds in nuts are polyphenols and
[633.00 - 637.84] omega-3 fatty acids my favorite and the
[635.72 - 640.52] epigenetic effects that come from this
[637.84 - 643.52] is that these nutrients can modulate
[640.52 - 646.08] gene expression involved in inflammation
[643.52 - 648.28] lipid metabolism and also promotes heart
[646.08 - 650.92] health and its all around status Like
[648.28 - 652.80] verat kohi It's ability to reduce
[650.92 - 655.76] inflammation in the human body now
[652.80 - 657.72] garlic if you do not like garlic one of
[655.76 - 659.72] the most important compounds I got to
[657.72 - 662.64] tell you why it contains something known
[659.72 - 665.04] as allisin and Organo sulfur compounds
[662.64 - 667.48] yes you may smell but the epigenetic
[665.04 - 670.20] effects on this compound can influence
[667.48 - 673.84] histone modification and DNA methylation
[670.20 - 675.96] potentially reducing cancer risk soy one
[673.84 - 678.84] of my favorite compounds janin and
[675.96 - 681.84] deadin found inside soy have epigenetic
[678.84 - 684.64] effects these isof flavons in soy can
[681.84 - 686.80] modulate DNA methylation and hisone
[684.64 - 689.64] modification and now this may help
[686.80 - 692.24] prevent hormone related cancers however
[689.64 - 694.72] I would like to insert a medical caution
[692.24 - 697.04] soy can go in both directions it's
[694.72 - 700.20] important to understand that for certain
[697.04 - 702.88] hormone-based cancers soy may actually
[700.20 - 706.08] promote the development of a cancer so
[702.88 - 708.64] it's best that you conduct or contact
[706.08 - 710.92] your medical dietitian and oncology
[708.64 - 713.48] expert or family doctor to give you
[710.92 - 715.80] specific advice on whether you should
[713.48 - 717.96] incorporate soy in your diet but for
[715.80 - 721.48] General people out there soy is
[717.96 - 723.80] relatively safe and has a good impact on
[721.48 - 726.20] all your disease markers and my next one
[723.80 - 728.96] is fatty fish the compounds found in
[726.20 - 732.76] fatty fish are omega-3 fatty acids
[728.96 - 735.56] specifically EPA and DHA the epigenetic
[732.76 - 737.80] effects of Omega-3 are that it can
[735.56 - 739.92] influence gene expression not only
[737.80 - 742.28] inflammation but also brain health and
[739.92 - 744.60] cardiovascular health thus reducing the
[742.28 - 746.24] risk of chronic disease so now I've got
[744.60 - 748.08] all of these ideas of what's good for
[746.24 - 750.24] you but how do we incorporate this into
[748.08 - 752.68] your daily diet and it an epigenetic
[750.24 - 755.32] food that's added to your diet now I
[752.68 - 757.68] want you to harness the epigenetic power
[755.32 - 760.52] of these foods and I want you to
[757.68 - 763.92] consider including them every day in
[760.52 - 765.84] your daily diet to protect your DNA to
[763.92 - 767.92] improve your epigenetics so let's start
[765.84 - 769.96] with breakfast in my opinion one of the
[767.92 - 772.52] most powerful meals of the day can do a
[769.96 - 775.96] smoothie featuring berries maybe baby
[772.52 - 779.28] spinach and sprinkle ground flax seed
[775.96 - 782.52] for an omega-3 boost this is a great can
[779.28 - 784.76] a protector lunch enjoy a salad with
[782.52 - 787.64] mixed greens greens are beautiful
[784.76 - 790.40] broccoli and a light dressing of olive
[787.64 - 792.76] oil maybe extra virgin olive oil don't
[790.40 - 795.24] heat that oil and a Sprinkle of lemon
[792.76 - 798.56] juice on that so for dinner opt for
[795.24 - 801.16] turmeric spiced grilled salmon mackerel
[798.56 - 803.68] Indian ravas all of this can be served
[801.16 - 805.48] at a side of garlic roasted vegetables
[803.68 - 807.24] so the garlic and the omega-3 from the
[805.48 - 809.32] fatty fish really protect you now those
[807.24 - 811.56] were the three meals of the day but what
[809.32 - 813.60] about snacks you could keep a handful of
[811.56 - 815.92] nuts don't do too many nuts because you
[813.60 - 818.48] could put on weight but don't forget to
[815.92 - 820.48] add a cup of green tea and this is a
[818.48 - 822.48] great way to have a healthy epigenetic
[820.48 - 825.00] friendly snack so there you have it the
[822.48 - 828.44] field of epigenetics offers a powerful
[825.00 - 830.76] perspective on how your dietary choices
[828.44 - 833.68] can influence your health at the genetic
[830.76 - 836.68] level by incorporating foods rich in
[833.68 - 840.12] bioactive compounds we can potentially
[836.68 - 843.88] activate beneficial genes and silence
[840.12 - 846.52] those that increase disease risk as a
[843.88 - 849.32] country's top nutritionist I encourage
[846.52 - 851.64] you to embrace these epigenetic foods
[849.32 - 854.68] and maybe unlock the secrets to a
[851.64 - 858.76] healthier longer life remember what you
[854.68 - 860.40] eat today can shape your genetic Destiny

[869.36 - 874.28] the link in the descriptor where I have
[871.32 - 877.68] made all the relevant markers that we
[874.28 - 881.04] test for at the genetic level so once
[877.68 - 883.32] you have your DNA blueprint fitted out
[881.04 - 886.04] you now know how to build the
[883.32 - 889.32] epigenetics on top of that for example I
[886.04 - 892.68] have a magnesium deficient Gene so that
[889.32 - 896.56] DNA marker was tested once it was tested
[892.68 - 899.08] it gave me the forecasting knowledge to
[896.56 - 900.88] know what I should do so what's that for
[899.08 - 903.60] casting knowledge hey I'm deficient in
[900.88 - 906.08] magnesium so the test has told me I need

[906.08 - 909.76] take it as a supplement or I could
[908.04 - 912.36] discover which are the foods which give
[909.76 - 915.24] me more magnesium in both cases at the
[912.36 - 918.16] qua nutrition clinic me and my team of
[915.24 - 920.64] nutrigenomic counselors are authorized
[918.16 - 923.00] certified as well as qualified to guide
[920.64 - 925.68] you on doing the test conducting the
[923.00 - 929.56] test interpreting the test and then
