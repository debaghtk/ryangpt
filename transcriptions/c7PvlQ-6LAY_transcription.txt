[0.00 - 5.61] I have a question yeah so where do we
[2.88 - 9.84] get high acidity and taking supplement
[5.61 - 12.24] for long time very well very good
[9.84 - 14.55] question so first question is acidity
[12.24 - 17.31] acidity everyone knows acidosis and
[14.55 - 19.26] athletes it's not because it builds up
[17.31 - 21.75] to such a level and click so normally
[19.26 - 23.94] pure that is one one aspect second this
[21.75 - 27.12] because of long intervals of training
[23.94 - 29.07] athletes don't eat enough second is lot
[27.12 - 31.56] of the athletes eat outside coaches it
[29.07 - 34.77] outside trainers it outside can can can
[31.56 - 36.03] disturb your gastric mucosa okay acidity
[34.77 - 38.88] can be genetic
[36.03 - 43.65] it can be genetic now do supplements
[38.88 - 46.29] cause acidity yes I believe that to a
[43.65 - 48.78] certain extent when you look at a food
[46.29 - 51.36] allergy test okay when you look at food
[48.78 - 53.88] allergy test if you're taking foods like
[51.36 - 54.45] gluten lactose and they're not agreeing
[53.88 - 58.22] with you
[54.45 - 60.75] the gut and the intestine are releasing
[58.22 - 63.42] unnecessary amount of enzymes to digest
[60.75 - 66.36] that food which I don't like so in terms
[63.42 - 68.64] of healing we can acidity can be treated
[66.36 - 70.65] from the range of things but from a
[68.64 - 72.93] nutritional point of view our basic
[70.65 - 74.28] premise is the alkaline diet the
[72.93 - 77.04] alkaline diet is coming from the
[74.28 - 80.22] prospect of finding more alkaline foods
[77.04 - 82.80] and you could use soda bike up in your
[80.22 - 84.78] sports drinks to reduce the acidity to
[82.80 - 89.45] reduce acid also so from that direction
[84.78 - 91.71] we can use supplements to reduce acidity
[89.45 - 93.63] things like I have had athletes with
[91.71 - 99.26] omega-3 when they take an accessory in
[93.63 - 101.88] acidic so even what was the other one
[99.26 - 106.20] there's one more that very frequently
[101.88 - 109.62] causes at 75 it's fabulous lot of carpet
[106.20 - 111.39] sometimes Lewis acid a caffeine aspirin
[109.62 - 115.47] for the longest period of time aspirin
[111.39 - 118.92] has been used as the ECA stack if you
[115.47 - 121.17] remember the effort in caffeine and
[118.92 - 123.51] aspirin will be out for the c√©vennes
[121.17 - 126.77] athletes take this they tend to have
[123.51 - 130.19] greater moderate is trying
[126.77 - 134.21] can you take medicines for acidity and
[130.19 - 136.76] does it help so so what is the medicine
[134.21 - 139.79] do so I always say no if you get cut
[136.76 - 142.01] like you have to find out how you got
[139.79 - 144.05] cut so how you have to discover why
[142.01 - 146.51] you're getting a setting is it improper
[144.05 - 149.12] diet timing is it improper food in the
[146.51 - 152.48] diet is it overload or supplement is it
[149.12 - 155.12] genetic now the short short term fix
[152.48 - 157.01] will be medication okay
[155.12 - 158.90] because medication your proton pump
[157.01 - 161.36] inhibitors and all of that stuff will
[158.90 - 164.36] reduce your as I said production and
[161.36 - 166.52] medical yes if a person is in pain the
[164.36 - 168.56] correct prognosis is to go to a doctor
[166.52 - 170.12] and get a prescription to take care of
[168.56 - 172.40] that side by side work of the country
[170.12 - 173.87] does probiotic help in acidity throw by
[172.40 - 175.76] this hundred percent specifically
[173.87 - 178.94] lactobacillus acidophilus and before the
[175.76 - 181.07] doctor really has been a acidity what
[178.94 - 182.32] has worked in my clinical practice has
[181.07 - 184.25] been glutamine
[182.32 - 186.68] glutamine early morning on an empty
[184.25 - 188.99] stomach helps in healing the intestinal
[186.68 - 191.87] mucosa so I know what five grams of
[188.99 - 195.11] glutamine early morning also when you
[191.87 - 198.20] have protein and 5 gram teaspoon every
[195.11 - 202.16] two three hours it forms a bolus so the
[198.20 - 203.75] acid attacks the the the protein forms
[202.16 - 205.85] of bolus which is a common problem like
[203.75 - 208.27] it's well suffering stomach and protects
[205.85 - 210.98] the lining of the stomach from getting
[208.27 - 213.46] attacked so you can actually use food to
[210.98 - 216.47] kind of cheat and prevent a society so
[213.46 - 217.31] apple churning of vinegar so take it in
[216.47 - 220.73] empty stomach
[217.31 - 223.43] does it help I've had both cases I had
[220.73 - 224.93] both cases so I'm Oprah doctor to see
[223.43 - 227.54] fit you should Google up this kind of
[224.93 - 230.81] this - Dominic he's the world renowned
[227.54 - 233.42] professor on alkaline cure so he
[230.81 - 235.49] recommends apple cider vinegar or any
[233.42 - 238.46] morning but when I have recommended
[235.49 - 240.77] apple cider vinegar to certain equal it
[238.46 - 243.59] actually increases so it's the the
[240.77 - 246.50] acid-base balance varies for positive
[243.59 - 248.30] food so again that's why people like me
[246.50 - 250.85] are in business because they never one
[248.30 - 253.42] right answer okay so you have to do the
[250.85 - 253.42] trial and error
