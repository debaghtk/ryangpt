Transcript: hi my name is ryan ferrano and i'm the chief nutritionist at kwan nutrition clinics we're a team of dietitians at practice online and at our clinics across the world now my job as a chief nutritionist is to change the way people eat my parents have taught me how to eat i love my parents i miss them a lot i haven't seen them in the last two years mr vishnupay here on my screen is my father's age 72 year old mr vishnupay came to me last year in october which was nine months ago with diabetes on insulin toe had to be cut and amputated because of the high sugar level so if you've been there as a kid taking care of your parents and i'm afraid for my parents because they've given me the best in life and i want to give the best back to them and i believe that nutrition can really really change the way a person's health can be you know made better so mr bishop came with me with all of these problems and i just want to show to you his success and this could be your parent this could be your parent with diabetes hypertension heart disease cholesterol even cancer we have a cancer division and quantitation and i want to show you he came in in october his weight was 100 kgs okay you can see the graph here as he's worked on a monthly nutrition plan with me and his dropped weight today he's come down to 78 kgs that's a whopping 28 kgs down i am wearing my old t-shirt and floating in it now two of me can fit into it and look at his fan percentage from 33 percent down to 25 if you look at his fart mass in his kgs that means mr vishnupay at 72 when he came to me had 30 kgs of fat in his body and the fat is causing the insulin resistance which is causing you to have diabetes with weight training and every month proper guided nutrition plan is down to 19.78 kgs but what i want to communicate to you better is the muscle mass he hasn't lost muscle mass he is remain stagnant look at this straight line look at the straight line and then look at his visceral fat visceral fat is the fat around the organs now zero is really really good uh most people have around 30 visceral fats or big pot bellies diabetes cholesterol death cancer all of that related to the visceral fat i just convinced him to improve walking and 18.5 down to 12 visceral fat we're still on the battle to go even lower but look at his body age body age is metabolic age when he started with me his birth certificate age nine january 2021 and his metabolic age was the same but as he's gone on a plan with me he has come down in metabolic age so today mr vishnupai is 61 years old he in nine months has become 11 years younger i am wearing my son's clothes and looking smart the other thing i want to show you is his blood parameters in 2015 we have data here 12.5 glycerated hemoglobin in 2009 it was 2019 still 11.6 when he joined me in october was 11.5 this is his blood test and today i can proudly tell you he's no longer a diabetic he's no longer an insulin he's no longer on medication because we have changed the way he eats and we've changed and guided the way he's done his fat burning wire exercise this is amazing look at a fasting average sugar level three one two and when he started off with me it was 283 283 and today he's down to 114 fasting sugar level and and this is so so amazing if you look at all his parameters improving we we target all of this over a period of time look at his glucose 185 down to 103 and right now i don't have the data but he's down at 80. the the best part about this gentleman is he's he's so fit today that uh you know i wanted to share a small video with you uh i want to share a small video with you which is that's him his old jeans his old jeans and he's floating in it so my perspective to you as a kid who loves his or her parent is our parents took care of us and they told us what to eat and how to eat it don't eat snacks and don't eat chocolate i have the same phone call to my parents these days and i wish and hope that you're like aj and sanjay his two kids who said mr fernando nothing doing our father has given us everything in the world we want him to come on a nutrition plan with you at coordination and he was very reluctant initially it's like oh it's a medicine you're going to stop me from you i'm going to play a video of him in his green tea i just i just fell off the chair laughing having my green tea his green tea video is delirious he hates green tea but did you know that green tea helps improve insulin resistance i give him negativity which improves insulin sensitivity so there are a lot of molecules in nature that can help you lose weight age gracefully become younger and above all throw out the medicine basket that modern day medicine is giving you and it's not the medicine that's wrong it's your way that you eat is wrong so kua teaches you how to eat correctly anybody watching this video if you don't have your parent on a nutrition plan with us well you're not pushing your parents enough take care reach out to us at coordination.com and this video is only for the kids who have parents who are not male if your parents are healthy thumbs up to you and your family
