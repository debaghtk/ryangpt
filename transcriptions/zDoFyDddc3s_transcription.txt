[0.24 - 3.60] we have a lot of people who follow us
[2.20 - 5.52] who will be pooping every day and be
[3.60 - 7.08] eating every day and mostly they come to
[5.52 - 8.84] me because they eat wrong and there's
[7.08 - 11.36] one problem I can't solve in eating is
[8.84 - 13.80] when people live in pgs and they saying
[11.36 - 15.64] that how do I control gastric if I stay
[13.80 - 17.56] in pgs and hotels because they add
[15.64 - 18.92] baking soda to food so you know there
[17.56 - 21.00] are modifiable factors and then
[18.92 - 22.96] non-modifiable factors non-modifiable
[21.00 - 25.12] factors it looks like in this person
[22.96 - 26.44] where they are giving baking soda in the
[25.12 - 29.24] mess and he doesn't have any other
[26.44 - 31.72] option to modify that best case scenario
[29.24 - 33.96] is stop it but as a medical doctor do
[31.72 - 35.80] you think baking soda does a KU or
[33.96 - 37.40] irritate your gut it completely depends
[35.80 - 40.08] upon the individual it's bio individual
[37.40 - 41.76] does the same hold true for medicines
[40.08 - 43.52] yeah so that's why when we talked about
[41.76 - 45.28] the cium husk some patients may be able
[43.52 - 46.24] to tolerate it so what I tell my
[45.28 - 48.08] patients is whenever there's a
[46.24 - 49.56] non-modifiable risk factor where you
[48.08 - 51.84] really absolutely love this baking soda
[49.56 - 53.60] it's okay but see whether you're able to
[51.84 - 55.16] check all the other risk factors that
[53.60 - 56.56] you can modify like sleeping properly
[55.16 - 59.84] eating or right are the other times and
[56.56 - 59.84] all those things
