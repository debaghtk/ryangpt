[46.21 - 54.85] the human body is a unique machine and
[51.04 - 58.51] we are all eating out of love and
[54.85 - 61.60] culture so love comes from mummy or love
[58.51 - 65.20] comes from the wife or the mother okay
[61.60 - 66.04] and it then changes to the culture so if
[65.20 - 67.90] you are a Marwari
[66.04 - 69.13] you will have a certain type of food if
[67.90 - 71.11] you're a kinetic car you'll have a

[88.36 - 93.43] so your food change is correct certainly
[90.34 - 97.15] dosa becomes and Italy becomes a new
[93.43 - 100.15] part of the diet and all so my job today
[97.15 - 103.03] is to convince you two things what you
[100.15 - 104.17] are doing is wrong the first thing I
[103.03 - 105.46] want to convince you is what you're
[104.17 - 107.71] doing is wrong for embackment in
[105.46 - 109.15] perspective for the parents over here
[107.71 - 111.16] you please do whatever you do whenever
[109.15 - 113.29] you get hypertension cholesterol BP you
[111.16 - 115.87] come to us after that but for the
[113.29 - 120.07] children we can't afford for them to
[115.87 - 121.30] fall for them to become lesser in terms
[120.07 - 123.72] of performance so I'm going to give you
[121.30 - 126.15] some secret tips today hope
[123.72 - 128.82] at some point you'll understand like
[126.15 - 131.13] coaching you have to invest in a coach
[128.82 - 132.72] and get quotes because everyone can play

[132.72 - 136.89] school no I also played in college so
[135.21 - 139.08] you also played I also played we can
[136.89 - 140.97] teach our children but why do we come to
[139.08 - 143.70] an academy why do we come with
[140.97 - 146.52] professional coaches the idea is they
[143.70 - 148.77] know how to train the individual
[146.52 - 151.47] correctly why do we send our children to
[148.77 - 153.21] school because the teacher and the
[151.47 - 156.84] school and the principal know how to
[153.21 - 161.46] import education the function of a
[156.84 - 165.05] nutritionist is to impart the education
[161.46 - 168.93] towards sipar puta dal chawal roti
[165.05 - 172.47] protein powder sports drink how to take
[168.93 - 174.24] when to take how much to take this is
[172.47 - 177.93] very important this starts as young as

[177.93 - 186.78] age 7 8 9 10 11 years old 11 years old
[184.59 - 189.12] okay so 11 11 is my first starting point
[186.78 - 191.64] over here so I have athletes as young as
[189.12 - 193.11] 8 years of age okay any other parents
[191.64 - 197.49] here children are less than 10 years of
[193.11 - 199.89] age yeah before 10 years of age is the
[197.49 - 203.82] exact age to capture the children for
[199.89 - 206.25] eating 12 13 they are forming adult
[203.82 - 208.89] mindset I don't like this I don't like
[206.25 - 210.18] that all of those things so we will we
[208.89 - 213.83] will talk today's how we go through
[210.18 - 213.83] everything okay
[215.36 - 220.70] which sport do you see everybody which
[219.02 - 223.90] sport you just look at it over here and
[220.70 - 223.90] tell me which sport do you see
[224.99 - 229.49] which one came to your mind first a
[227.44 - 231.98] badminton player will see the background
[229.49 - 236.38] in first a tennis player will see the
[231.98 - 240.14] tennis first okay what's my point
[236.38 - 242.18] this is saying okay and this thing is
[240.14 - 249.35] for the kids can you read this thing for
[242.18 - 253.39] me how hard do you play when no one
[249.35 - 253.39] watches what does that mean
[256.11 - 263.98] appreciatively I'm correct correct
[260.89 - 268.59] you have to play your best the problem
[263.98 - 268.59] today is everything is about a selfie
[268.95 - 276.52] repeat check' a Technica selfie book
[272.43 - 279.55] it's not about the selfie it's about who
[276.52 - 282.13] you are so for those of you who have
[279.55 - 285.64] back meant in players there are only two
[282.13 - 289.78] questions I asked one do you love back
[285.64 - 295.03] mitten or do you like badminton like oh
[289.78 - 298.00] love love love so if you love does
[295.03 - 300.55] nothing from tomorrow morning onwards
[298.00 - 304.21] don't get up with an alarm clock get up
[300.55 - 306.04] on your own okay that's the true sign of
[304.21 - 308.14] a champion oh I've seen this at though I
[306.04 - 311.38] have about 6,000 athletes over the last
[308.14 - 314.26] 20 years with me okay I've had some of
[311.38 - 315.91] the best in India come to me the last
[314.26 - 318.79] word the the guy that I'm currently
[315.91 - 320.41] working on is cyber on it okay so we are
[318.79 - 322.18] working on a vajayjay Rama Marwan but
[320.41 - 324.04] all of these guys sign on a wall all of
[322.18 - 326.26] them have come to tours for nutrition
[324.04 - 329.05] planning but what I want to say to you
[326.26 - 331.75] is as a parent if your child shows love
[329.05 - 336.06] to the game you move heaven and earth
[331.75 - 339.60] for that child if the child shows like
[336.06 - 343.21] you have alternate plans in place also
[339.60 - 344.94] okay the first question was do you love
[343.21 - 348.81] Batman
[344.94 - 351.27] the second question I have then is do
[348.81 - 352.62] you want to play for the country how
[351.27 - 358.23] many of you want to play for the country
[352.62 - 360.00] please raise your hand okay I'll give
[358.23 - 366.21] you a small tip to all the athletes in
[360.00 - 369.90] over here the number one ability for you
[366.21 - 373.77] to win is not in food is not in coaching
[369.90 - 377.10] is not in your equipment it is in your
[373.77 - 383.97] head do you know what that word is it
[377.10 - 387.69] starts with C confidence the number one
[383.97 - 390.21] trait for any player in any sport in any
[387.69 - 394.44] sport is confidence you have the
[390.21 - 397.41] confidence you will win the problem with
[394.44 - 401.34] Indian athletes is they take 10 years to
[397.41 - 403.59] acquire confidence in their 20s 25 then
[401.34 - 405.18] they get the confidence what if you had
[403.59 - 409.14] confidence today that you are the world
[405.18 - 411.18] number 1 how would you play then like
[409.14 - 413.13] world number 2 no you'll be like I am
[411.18 - 415.68] the West in the world so if you saw my
[413.13 - 417.42] first slide with me in the photo did
[415.68 - 422.87] anyone notice what I what I wrote at the
[417.42 - 424.50] bottom no I'll play it back to you again
[422.87 - 431.13] [Music]
[424.50 - 434.67] what did I write read it for me I may
[431.13 - 436.56] not be the best but when I put the word
[434.67 - 439.80] I am the best over there what does it do
[436.56 - 443.25] to me it gives me confidence plus it
[439.80 - 445.17] gives me fear because I have to prove
[443.25 - 446.88] that I'm the best now so which means
[445.17 - 448.86] every morning when I'm getting up I am
[446.88 - 450.63] studying I am preparing for my seminar I
[448.86 - 452.64] am looking at diet charts I am looking
[450.63 - 454.50] at scientific studies what should you do
[452.64 - 456.81] as a beginner player I'm the number one
[454.50 - 460.53] battement player in my academy in my
[456.81 - 461.73] district in my state in my country once
[460.53 - 466.89] you start having this thought process
[461.73 - 470.64] you will start winning it's got nothing
[466.89 - 472.29] to do with bananas or walnuts actually
[470.64 - 474.30] bananas and walnuts actually help in the
[472.29 - 475.92] brain performance I'll come to that but
[474.30 - 477.66] confidence is the number and so from
[475.92 - 478.61] today onwards I'll say hi my name is
[477.66 - 481.56] Ryan what's your name
[478.61 - 483.41] shake hands nice and form sure and my
[481.56 - 485.82] name is Sharon you gotta have confidence
[483.41 - 488.37] do all the badminton players you can't
[485.82 - 492.39] be shy because if you're shy your pony
[488.37 - 494.73] is going to defeat you you have to call
[492.39 - 497.34] out that you are the best you don't do
[494.73 - 497.96] that you're not give a stick get the
[497.34 - 500.25] point
[497.96 - 501.72] never mind if you are not the best never
[500.25 - 505.83] mind if you come last in the tournament
[501.72 - 507.45] it's okay but every day you keep telling
[505.83 - 510.48] yourself that you move up the ladder
[507.45 - 512.46] okay so today I want to talk about the
[510.48 - 514.53] basics in terms of what we need to be
[512.46 - 516.45] doing and all so how hard do you play
[514.53 - 519.36] when no one's watching what I want to
[516.45 - 523.16] point out to parents is this okay if you
[519.36 - 526.62] see over here 33% is rest and recovery
[523.16 - 529.11] 33% is nutrition 33% is training what
[526.62 - 533.46] most sports individuals in India do is
[529.11 - 537.29] invest only in training about one good
[533.46 - 539.64] shoes papaya one best your next record
