[2.28 - 6.93] long form content of podcast here are
[4.72 - 11.31] some short form clips for you to
[6.93 - 11.31] [Music]
[12.92 - 17.16] enjoy they say that Japan whilst you
[15.60 - 20.00] have the Sumer wrestlers who are very
[17.16 - 22.36] powerful you also have the karate people
[20.00 - 25.04] you have the Samurai warrior uh you have
[22.36 - 27.44] Japan having Health spars you have Japan
[25.04 - 30.04] having a lot of Health screenings why
[27.44 - 32.24] does the Japanese government and the
[30.04 - 34.72] Japanese people and why is it there in
[32.24 - 36.60] Japanese culture that health screening
[34.72 - 39.36] is very
[36.60 - 42.72] important so basically health screening
[39.36 - 45.04] start in the war war time in Japan at
[42.72 - 48.08] that time Japanese government wanted to
[45.04 - 50.36] make all people healthier so at that
[48.08 - 53.84] time like you know it's TV uh
[50.36 - 57.00] tuberculosis spread it so all the time
[53.84 - 60.56] uh to find at early stage to remove or
[57.00 - 63.84] to treat so this was this was a original
[60.56 - 66.36] but after that change the culture one by
[63.84 - 69.20] one for example like after that it's a
[66.36 - 71.92] cancer because age become country become
[69.20 - 74.80] aging so cancer screening is become
[71.92 - 77.88] important and after that so many people
[74.80 - 79.88] become rich and eat more so then like
[77.88 - 82.52] more heart attack and diabetic this kind
[79.88 - 85.08] of happen so that's why like lifestyle
[82.52 - 88.48] screening start so it's a like a long
[85.08 - 89.92] history around 50 around 70 years so
[88.48 - 91.32] lifestyle screening is not only happen
[89.92 - 92.64] happening for your generation it has
[91.32 - 96.28] been happening for your father's
[92.64 - 99.36] generation also uh yeah yes yes yes
[96.28 - 102.40] cancer screening start my father's
[99.36 - 106.56] generation lifestyle Disease start from
[102.40 - 110.44] my generation I'm aged now uh 42 okay so
[106.56 - 113.12] this start around 30 years ago so tell
[110.44 - 115.64] me something uh at what age do the
[113.12 - 120.64] Japanese people go for their first
[115.64 - 123.40] screening test 22 22 m then I join the
[120.64 - 125.56] company then start this is a company
[123.40 - 127.64] overation I'm not able to understand
[125.56 - 131.36] what is that Japanese philosophy in
[127.64 - 134.04] India people wait to fall sick at any
[131.36 - 136.84] age and go to doctor so why is the
[134.04 - 140.04] company screening at 22 this is actually
[136.84 - 142.60] government rule mhm so uh Japanese
[140.04 - 145.20] government uh has a obligation uh
[142.60 - 147.44] everybody employee have to be in health
[145.20 - 150.60] screening mhm so when I joined the
[147.44 - 152.72] company at 22 years old every year I
[150.60 - 155.32] have to go if I don't go company will
[152.72 - 157.32] punish me I have to go but India if
[155.32 - 159.24] you're listening in the company says you
[157.32 - 160.84] should go for screening government
[159.24 - 162.92] insists with the company please screen
[160.84 - 164.92] your employee for their health so this
[162.92 - 167.80] is mostly lifestyle disease scening
[164.92 - 171.76] correct lifesty and cancer screening
[167.80 - 174.20] okay and are there um has this helped
[171.76 - 176.52] Japan have lower segment of the
[174.20 - 179.00] population having diabetes hypertension
[176.52 - 180.52] cancer is there statistical data showing
[179.00 - 183.20] an improvement over over the last three
[180.52 - 185.84] four decades yes it's a drastically for
[183.20 - 187.56] example like my father's age young time
[185.84 - 190.72] my father's young time at that time like
[187.56 - 193.68] many fat people are there but like
[190.72 - 195.56] nowadays it's not not much see fat
[193.68 - 197.76] people if you come to Japan You Don't
[195.56 - 199.64] See Much F people I I have seen that
[197.76 - 203.80] there are no you watch films and
[199.64 - 206.40] documentary I'm looking in the the the
[203.80 - 208.52] station the zebra Crossing uh Tokyo
[206.40 - 210.92] Street five intersection you're like I
[208.52 - 214.24] looking no fat people yeah everybody
[210.92 - 218.08] same style same suit do Japanese do
[214.24 - 220.96] Japanese people go to the gym yes yes uh
[218.08 - 223.28] we go but more than that is a eating
[220.96 - 225.60] habit is controlled and the exercise
[223.28 - 228.72] also controlled okay so you're saying
[225.60 - 231.12] that the screening also at very young
[228.72 - 235.36] age gives you the
[231.12 - 238.28] awareness that oh there is a weight gain
[235.36 - 241.48] there is a blood pressure there is some
[238.28 - 244.68] cholesterol so in your personal health
[241.48 - 249.40] screening was there anything that made
[244.68 - 251.56] you change your lifestyle Behavior yeah
[249.40 - 254.56] for example when I joined the company by
[251.56 - 257.40] 22 years old with every year take
[254.56 - 263.04] screening then definitely some C is
[257.40 - 266.04] there so when I joined the company 68 69
[263.04 - 268.76] kilo but after the certain time I become
[266.04 - 273.96] gross gross gross and reach to 80 you
[268.76 - 276.80] are 80 k K wa and age at 35 at that time
[273.96 - 279.56] every year doctor alled me you you have
[276.80 - 281.84] to reduce you have to reduce so then uh
[279.56 - 285.52] like he allotted and on the same time my
[281.84 - 289.04] uric acid also grows with with uh you
[285.52 - 289.84] know are you a biology student no I'm a
[289.04 - 292.32] a
[289.84 - 293.96] businessman so so suddenly the awareness
[292.32 - 297.24] is coming oh there is something called
[293.96 - 300.00] uric acid yeah exactly this is I I I
[297.24 - 302.88] didn't know uric acid what is this but
[300.00 - 305.08] told me you are here but now your kilo
[302.88 - 309.36] is weight is here and U acid also
[305.08 - 311.88] followed so now you become 7.5 basically
[309.36 - 315.16] like average is five or six more than
[311.88 - 317.92] seven is dangerous I become seven eight
[315.16 - 321.12] and then doctor said like now you have
[317.92 - 322.88] to take medicine the to reduce like uric
[321.12 - 325.84] acid otherwise your kidney will be
[322.88 - 327.60] damaged in future I and then I asked him
[325.84 - 330.92] how many how long I have to take
[327.60 - 333.88] medicine he said lifetime I said what in
[330.92 - 336.12] the age of 35 I have no problem at all
[333.88 - 338.44] my feeling but he said like lifetime you
[336.12 - 340.76] have to take medicine I said wait wait
[338.44 - 342.60] doctor I don't want but he said no
[340.76 - 345.24] that's why I'm saying to reduce your
[342.60 - 347.48] weight with your reduce weight then your
[345.24 - 350.48] uric acid will go down and your kidney
[347.48 - 352.92] will be protected I said okay doctor but
[350.48 - 355.80] he didn't believe me because heed many
[352.92 - 360.20] time but I didn't take action but after
[355.80 - 364.56] that I take action so from 80 kilo 78
[360.20 - 367.80] 75 now around 72 so then uric acid will
[364.56 - 371.80] go down and doctor said good job keep
[367.80 - 374.20] your M weight at this at this level then
[371.80 - 376.76] you are healthy so that's why I'm like
[374.20 - 379.16] now but before I was bit F actually if I
[376.76 - 381.96] go like that my kidney damage maybe
[379.16 - 384.04] heart attack comes diabetic happen so
[381.96 - 387.24] this is the way Japanese people is
[384.04 - 390.12] control health so is there anything in
[387.24 - 392.12] Japanese culture that your parents or
[390.12 - 395.48] your grandparents talk about when it
[392.12 - 397.60] comes to food yeah we eat uh as much as
[395.48 - 400.84] of course we like but basically our
[397.60 - 400.84] culture said like
[401.36 - 410.12] har okay is saying like stop to eat my
[406.32 - 413.04] stomach feel 80% don't exceed more than
[410.12 - 416.80] 80% 100% 20%
[413.04 - 421.12] uh% then it will be like become fat and
[416.80 - 423.64] become who and become lazy so 80% stop
[421.12 - 426.68] keep maintain Health nicely and when do
[423.64 - 429.80] you learn this ah I don't exactly
[426.68 - 433.72] remember the company or the doctor tells
[429.80 - 436.88] you no in basically in the home yeah my
[433.72 - 439.68] father mother Granda culture yes yes
[436.88 - 443.88] okay yeah to educate for young kids to
[439.68 - 445.48] stop by E 80% so so I think another
[443.88 - 447.08] thing that Japan brings to us is the
[445.48 - 449.84] very large sumo
[447.08 - 452.28] wrestler yes yes so so he that Su
[449.84 - 454.08] wrestler eats more that is like special
[452.28 - 456.08] training special eating training is
[454.08 - 458.84] there eating training eating training
[456.08 - 462.76] every day five six seven times eat and
[458.84 - 465.92] sleep soon so two two hours like sleep
[462.76 - 468.28] and eat again sleep again sleep so and
[465.92 - 471.80] with like you know musle training so
