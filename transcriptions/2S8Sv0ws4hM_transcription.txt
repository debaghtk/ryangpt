Transcript: your diabetes is not under control you're taking 14 or 15 tablets when we don't remember our meals when we don't have a food diary when we don't have a CGM we are eating to fulfill our belly needs not our biochemistry requirement oh mad one meal a day now this can only be done with Medical Nutrition Therapy 57% of these individuals remain undiagnosed which means diabetics is a silent killer [Music] so here are some quick tips to help you manage your diabetes one definitely increase your fiber intake adding more fiber in your diet is really effective in managing diabetes because the fiber slows down or it actually hugs the sugar in that food and doesn't prevent its Rapid Release into the blood the foods that you include with Rich fiber are vegetables fruits whole grains and legumes you knew this I knew this vegetables such as broccoli spinach carrots fruits like apple berries and pears are my favorite in the whole grains oats is known to lower blood sugar levels quinoa brown rice and legumes with things like beans lentils chickpeas chickpeas are amazing to contribute in terms of holding your sugar Spike and all of these have high fiber which significantly will improve your blood glucose levels and your overall Digestive Health if you don't believe me slap on a CGM and check it out when you take fiber in your diet and watch your sugar Spike come down another thing you can do is choose Whole Foods now what are these Whole Foods Whole Foods is basically you reduce the processed foods because Whole Foods is what comes in from nature and when you have more Whole Foods they're typically free from added sugar they're typically free from unhealthy fats and added artificial additives and all of these including your diet erated beverages have a significant impact on your blood sugar levels even if they're zero calorie because of these additives preservatives and all the junk in it so you can improve your health by opting for fresh produce whole grains lean proteins healthy fats and ensure they're not in a plastic packet or package because then it has the pitfall of being highly processed now another tip healthy fats into your diets this can also Aid in the management of diabetes Now the unsaturated fats such as avocado nuts seeds olive oil even coconut oil in my opinion do not only provide the essential fatty acids but they also known to improve heart health and reduce inflammation now I'm not saying take too much of fats I'm saying carefully balance with Medical Nutrition you need to avoid trans fat heated fats microwave fats fried fats commercially baked goods that limits the saturated fat which are processed in the form of cooking and these are sometimes also present in fatty cuts of meat and full fat dairy products in fact I recommend that you focus on incorporating fats that support your metabolic health and overall well-being this for me has been a challenging Topic in terms of fats because whenever people come to me in the nutrition clinic they say Ryan Fernando what fat do you recommend for me to eat as a diabetic and I scratch my head and I'm like but you know what I've not done your genetic test because different types of people like I respond to saturated fat which is coconut oil and butter and ghee but I'm allergic to butter and ghee so kind of after doing all the testing I know that I can use coconut oil I had another client yesterday coconut oil saturated fat was not good but mufa was good which is olive oil avocado oil groundnut oil so you see we are even bioindividual when it comes to our sugar levels so be cautious about adding fat just because I'm saying it in a video so work with a medical nutritionist to get your fat levels controlled at the right level final point this is common sense limit added sugars and this is vital for maintaining stable blood sugar levels I remember when I put the CGM on I had seen that my cup of coffee with 1 teaspoon of sugar in it showed me a spike to 156 to 170 level then I had a cup of coffee without sugar in it and my level was at 110 then I did decaf coffee and my level was at 135 140 and then I did a little bit of research apparently caffeine also lowers sugar level but decaffeinated increases sugar level so it's very very interesting that the bio individuality was there so by telling my clients avoid beverages avoid sweets avoid processed food this is common sense the problem is does your tongue have common sense I don't think so the tongue doesn't have a brain your brain has brain cells which make executive decision but guess what your tongue is a slave to sugar salt and Umami flavor and a lot of these processed manufacturers add more amount of sugar I'll give you an example if I come to your house and I ask you for a glass of lassi oh Ryan Fernando's come I'll give him one teaspoon of sugar okay your friend comes you'll give him two teaspoons of sugar do you know commercial lassies have six teaspoons of sugar in them so understand it tastes good packaged food tastes good products in the market tastes good all of these juices and beverages taste good because they're adding sugar in it which you don't need so this is one thing that I need you to understand your taste bud is a slave to sugar and trust me even your brain cannot overcome it it has to be intentional it has to be counseled it has to be driven and unfortunately for a lot of people it only happens change only happens when you get the disease and then you're panicking and by the way at the beginning of the video I said 57% of people go undiagnosed if you have not done a blood test if you have not done a fasting glucose blood blood test then you can look at the link below in the descriptor and a list for blood test can be got from my website please do your blood test if you've never done you know what I found 16 and 18 year- old with pre-diabetic levels that is their hba1c levels at 5.7 5.9 6.1 6.2 and parents are shocked at this and they're like but the kids eating candy and sweets and chocolates all the time and when you go out you eat fast foods and cheaper fast foods with high carbohydrate content right from dosas to pizzas to Burgers to idys are all simple glycemic index High carbohydrate Foods causing the sugar diabetic pandemic of India so minimizing consumption of high sugar is what I am trying to convince you because this will prevent the daily spikes that happen on months days weeks years which then ultimately result in you getting blood sugar so what's the solution people say can I do sweetness why fruits yes you can can I do a natural sweetener like Stevia mon fruit yes you can but uh should I do like the chemical sweeteners the answer is no so whenever foods have as alamain sucros aspartame you know 100 years from now 20 years from now I don't know when they're going to come back and say that these sweeteners are not good and even Stevia and Mong fruit we don't have enough of research on daily exposure of it so once in a away twice Thrice four times a month is okay but every day we don't know how your microbiome which is the gut back how does it react to sweetness so stick to what was found in nature which is honey and fruits as your sweet therapy I'm really happy you watch this far you know what a lot of people don't watch this far so here are my tips to you to help you out with managing diabetes or high sugar levels leafy greens get vegetable juices with spinach kale and other greens because they so low in carbs you can make a juice of it it'll fill up your stomach you get more antioxidants and make you glow and that's one starting point second is fatty fish salmon mackerel anchovy sardines high in omega-3 improve your diabetic levels my favorites are nuts and seeds you can manage your diabetic levels you can eat almonds walnuts chia seeds flax seeds pine nuts pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds these all provide healthy fats and fiber and they fill up your stomach so you're not going towards processed foods and in the legume family all your beans lentil chickpeas they're all high in fiber they have some amount of protein and the carbohydrate is the complex carbohydrate the thumbs up so here's an interesting one cinnamon and this is my secret okay so if you watched this far thank you so much for watching this far if you have not subscribed to my YouTube Channel Please Subscribe and I'll send you some cinnamon from my hand all right now why cinnamon dalini is known to have a bioactive compound called Cinnamon alide Now cinnamon aldhy goes in and captur sugar and boost the insulin to be more effective it's it's kind of like saying you know giving intelligence to your insulin to work a little better and giving more ly to your sugar to enter into the cells of the body rather than roaming around in the blood sleep so lowered blood sugar levels with cinnamon now how much I did an experiment I put a CGM I drank orange juice got 190 then I added qu teaspoon of cinnamon to the orange juice and my blood sugar level went up to 140 only so 190 140 there is a world of a difference now I'm saying that you can add cinnamon in your diet regularly there was a research paper which said it reduces abdominal obesity by 4% but that was 4.5 G of cinnamon a day now if you take 4.5 G cinnamon a day which I did I got severe acidity and um I think my stomach got affected and I got a mouth ulcer so caution caution caution please consult your doctor please consult your medical nutritionist for any advice anywhere that I give you please consult a medical expert because you are bioindividual anything you decide to do what Ryan Fernando or the Quan nutrition team gives out to you is common knowledge available of the internet in scientific research papers and by medical experts but when we apply this to you maybe cinnamon might not work for you so maybe you just want to do a pinch of cinnamon the next guy is also very interesting and your dadima and my dadima and everyone's dadima has given it to them no it's not armonds it's turmeric now turmeric contains something known as curcumin it has anti-inflammatory and blood sugar lowering properties so I actually tell my clients drink a turmeric latte have a pepper Rasam soup with turmeric in it when you're having your night healthy dud turmeric dud that is good in fact I make my chamomile tea with a pinch of turmeric because I want a little bit of cumin you don't need to take a supplement in this part of the world because we have enough of Healy in all our meals so if you're making omelette in the morning sprinkle a little bit of hethy on a f if you're having avocado on have a little bit of curcumin on it if you're having some noodles make sure that your taste maker contains some pinch of hethy in it that's a way with termeric can have its anti-cancer and blood sugar lowering effects don't take too much of turmeric it's a blood thinner and can affect your digestive health now the other one uh you know garlic to be famous do you know that garlic can also ward off and improve your glucose and lower the sugar levels so garlic is one of those compounds that's anti-aging as well as helping in Sugar control now you can put all of these together don't do any of these Foods in excesses but do them in moderation like how I need you to do your diet in moderation maybe you want a CGM a continuous glucose monitor to manage your levels but in addition to this I would like you to do some Lifestyle Changes also in my counseling room I always tell my people physical activity physical activity 150 minutes per week which is roughly about 30 minutes a day for a 5day a week workout walking in my opinion is one of the best 7 days a week I also want you to include both aerobic exercises which is like walking but I also want you to include strength training because strength training builds muscle and when you do strength training insulin resistance comes down which means your insulin Sensi improves which means your sugar management gets good then I can't talk about weight weight weight weight weight not weight as in weight but vajan everybody in India has a higher BMI nowadays we're eating too much and moving lesser I want you to have a BMI of no more than 21 this is the perfect BMI if your BMI is 33 boss you need to wake up if your BMI is 24 boss you need to wake up if your BMI is 22 you still need to wake up because ultimately as you grow older you only get heavier anyone watching this video what was your weight 10 years ago was it lesser yes it was what is your weight today is it 5 KES heavier yeah it is 5 KES heavier and what's your weight going to be 10 years later oh sir I got I got diabetes in my 50s why because you got this extra weight in addition to the weight as we get older we have more responsibilities we get stressed so I need you to practice stress reducing techniques my personal favorite and I do it because I run multiple businesses I do counseling all the time I make all of these videos shoot this go there speak here do this oh man so much of stress I got to do yoga I do yoga after this video I'm getting into a deep breathing session with with my yoga and meditation Guru for 30 minutes to lower my stress levels simple tip to lower your stress levels do four shallow breaths and one long breath and side this is what was taught to me by my yoga guy it activates your parasympathetic nervous system reduces stress if you reduce your stress you don't have constant sugar spikes when you eat so lowering your stress is really good but now the final point I'm coming to is adequate sleep I have found that I've been successful with every superstar and athlete and why I found out they Kryptonite I found out the accy heal I found out they PTI the punati is this they are not getting more than 6 to 7 hours of sleep I need people to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep last night I slept 7 hours 40 minutes in this entire month I can tell you EX exactly how much sleep I got you know what's my target 30 into 8 hours per day 240 hours of sleep per month is my Target and many of times I get only 200 hours and that's where our disease starts sleep is a non-negotiable component of your life the more you get of sleep the more accurate your sleep trust me your DNA is better your hormonal diseases are not there your aging is lesser and therefore I I need to tell you that sleep in my book is the new diet now final point I need you to do regular monitoring if you come from a family history of diabetes or have already tracked your blood sugar and it's higher you look at your blood sugar levels post pandal that's after meal hb1c look at your blood pressure look at all your cholesterol and I need you to pay attention to this bonus tip the bonus tip is that your diabetes is what is causing your heart attacks you see in LD cholesterol which is the bad cholesterol there is a protein called D100 D100 protects LDL and makes this Seda Sada bad cholesterol behave itself in the blood but the moment you start having higher sugar level this sugar goes and slaps D100 protein and tells him by don't give any protection to LDL cholesterol I want to go and punch LDL cholesterol and make it sticky so that is how your LDL cholesterol becomes sticky and forms block so the culprit is high blood sugar levels slapping D100 causing your cholesterol to misbehave and that misbehavior might suddenly cause you to have an heart attack you see you don't die from high blood sugar level you die from related conditions where sugar is the culprit which is why I can't emphasize how important is it for you not to get high sugar in your life get high on life don't get high on sugar thank you for watching the video thus far final tip and I hope you watch this far and I hope I've given you value and if I have given you some value please click on the Subscribe link please comment below that you loved my video it motivates me to come back and make long videos like this and hopefully if you can't come into my counseling room I'm able to reach you in your living room with this video now there's another secret how you eat in serial order your food in a meal is so important it's called the timing inside the meal and I say that first you have your fiber so you know I come from Goa and uh my father tamilan and my mother is Goan and we have the Portuguese culture at Gua where we actually first have a piece of vegetable like a salad then we do a soup and then we have a Beal and I never understood that but when I read the glucose goddess and she talked about it as a biochemist I'm a biochemist she's a biochemist I'm like damn we've been doing this for centuries first we ate fiber so it first have your salad or your soup lots of fiber then do your protein which is your dlls your paneer your non wage then do your carbohydrates which is your rice or Ry and leave your dessert for last and this is my solution after you finish your dinner or your lunch go for a 10-minute walk as soon as you come back from a walk have your dessert don't sit down get on the phone and call your loved one whilst you're having that dessert I found this out by putting the CGM on my shoulder and then I found out that hey this is a great way for me to control a sugar Spike not going too high if you've enjoyed this video share this video with them or get in touch with us and we will get in touch with your love runs to help them manage their health better by just teaching them that the taste buds are not boss but the thought process is the boss
