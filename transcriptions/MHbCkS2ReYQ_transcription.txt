[4.47 - 8.87] Hello, hello, hello. 
[12.98 - 18.08] think about late midnight here 
[15.48 - 19.42] in Bangalore, India. It's seven 
[18.15 - 22.12] o'clock. We're doing a live 
[19.49 - 24.69] today and I'm joining Phillipa 
[22.19 - 25.93] Butler, a, chartered 
[24.76 - 29.06] physiotherapist, a certified 
[25.99 - 30.03] Pilates instructor, a certified 
[29.13 - 31.60] hatha yoga. I have always 
[30.10 - 32.93] wanted to learn hatha yoga. And 
[31.66 - 35.87] she is a meditation teacher. 
[33.00 - 37.37] And ah if you're in New York, 
[35.94 - 38.64] it's probably early morning. 
[37.44 - 40.97] So, good morning to you. This 
[38.70 - 43.61] is the menopause initiative 
[41.04 - 45.11] where I decided to bring a 
[43.68 - 47.51] little bit of information 
[45.18 - 50.22] across to you about the wisdom 
[47.58 - 51.85] of menopause and at our 
[50.28 - 52.92] nutrition clinic at the Quaa 
[51.92 - 54.09] Nutrition Clinics where I 
[52.99 - 54.95] practice as a nutritionist. 
[54.15 - 56.59] Now, if you don't know who I am 
[55.02 - 58.76] and you just kind of stumbled 
[56.66 - 61.16] upon this video or this live 
[58.82 - 65.03] stream, well, that's amazing. 
[61.23 - 67.10] I, I am a nutritionist. I work 
[65.10 - 70.04] a lot of celebrities in the 
[67.17 - 71.37] continent of Asia. And these 
[70.10 - 73.91] celebrities include sports 
[71.44 - 75.41] athletes, include film stars, 
[73.97 - 78.01] industrialists and many a times 
[75.47 - 80.65] very, very, very successful 
[78.08 - 84.45] business women. Now, today's 
[80.71 - 86.05] talk is merging the fields of 
[84.52 - 88.62] exercise and diet and 
[86.12 - 91.49] nutrition. So, I have got a 
[88.69 - 94.16] guest who's probably just had a 
[91.56 - 95.56] lunch in India if she was here, 
[94.23 - 97.00] she would be called Doctor 
[95.63 - 98.90] Phillipa Butler as a chartered 
[97.06 - 101.47] physiotherapist. So, Phillipa 
[98.97 - 105.14] Are you around? Have I got a 
[101.53 - 105.14] connection through to you? 
[105.61 - 110.58] Yes, you certainly do. Hi, good 
[108.07 - 112.41] afternoon to you. Hi, good 
[110.64 - 113.71] afternoon to you, Brian. I'm 
[112.48 - 115.35] joining you virtually with a 
[113.78 - 116.48] cup of tea. Mine's chamomile 
[115.41 - 117.85] tea because I got to sleep in 
[116.55 - 121.05] about three hours. Have you had 
[117.92 - 123.79] your cuppa today? I've had a 
[121.12 - 126.43] few cuppas already. Uh water 
[123.86 - 127.53] only for me this afternoon. 
[126.49 - 130.06] Wonderful. And if people are 
[127.59 - 134.00] joining us live on our various 
[130.13 - 136.03] Facebook platforms. The purpose 
[134.07 - 138.10] of today's discussion with Ryan 
[136.10 - 139.61] Fernando that's, me the 
[138.17 - 142.28] nutritionist. And Phillipa 
[139.67 - 143.61] Butler the Pilates instructors 
[142.34 - 145.21] worked with a lot of people and 
[143.68 - 147.71] I'm going to talk about the 
[145.28 - 149.65] wisdom of menopause. Exercise 
[147.78 - 152.25] and menopause. Nutrition in 
[149.72 - 154.45] menopause So strap on, let's 
[152.32 - 155.96] get seated and discussing on 
[154.52 - 158.56] this whole concept of 
[156.02 - 160.99] menopause. For me, menopause as 
[158.62 - 162.90] a man of 47 years of age, I 
[161.06 - 165.03] work with clients but I don't 
[162.96 - 166.97] understand it a lot of times. 
[165.10 - 169.74] Because they say you have to 
[167.03 - 171.17] experience menstruation and 
[169.80 - 173.57] then you have to experience the 
[171.24 - 176.14] pausing of menstruation which 
[173.64 - 178.54] is menopause. Phillipa, if, you 
[176.21 - 179.34] had to define to the world, 
[178.61 - 183.98] menopause. What would we all 
[179.41 - 188.05] take on it Ryan, we could be 
[184.05 - 191.02] here all day. But what so the 
[188.12 - 193.46] definition is that it's the 
[191.09 - 195.23] cessation of menstruation for 1 
[193.53 - 196.70] year. So that you know women 
[195.29 - 198.83] are considered to be in 
[196.76 - 201.40] menopause when they haven't had 
[198.90 - 203.13] a period for one whole year. 
[201.47 - 206.34] But really, you know, that's 
[203.20 - 208.44] the tip of the iceberg because 
[206.41 - 210.01] menopause comes to us in 
[208.51 - 213.58] advance of that, in as much as 
[210.08 - 215.01] the shifting is occurring way 
[213.65 - 217.48] way way in advance of the time 
[215.08 - 219.35] when the periods actually come 
[217.55 - 221.99] to a halt. And so it's this 
[219.42 - 223.42] time when many many women start 
[222.05 - 227.23] to struggle with a whole 
[223.49 - 229.40] variety of signs and symptoms 
[227.29 - 231.26] that you know for the most part 
[229.46 - 233.97] this stuff shouldn't take us by 
[231.33 - 235.63] surprise We should have known 
[234.03 - 237.37] about it. We should have been 
[235.70 - 238.87] anticipating it. But you know 
[237.44 - 240.91] people don't talk about this 
[238.94 - 243.74] stuff. And so so many women 
[240.97 - 245.98] It's a surprise to them. When 
[243.81 - 248.48] they start to experience 
[246.04 - 249.98] symptoms and it's a it's 
[248.55 - 251.52] confusing and people don't know 
[250.05 - 254.09] what is happening to them. That 
[251.58 - 257.92] is women of course. So you know 
[254.15 - 260.49] so that's my mission to try and 
[257.99 - 262.03] demystify this whole process 
[260.56 - 263.46] and to get the dialogue going. 
[262.10 - 266.13] The more that we can talk about 
[263.53 - 267.93] this and share our experiences 
[266.20 - 269.47] and menopause because you know 
[268.00 - 271.34] they can be as different as 
[269.54 - 274.14] each individual in the land. So 
[271.40 - 275.94] so it's really important to 
[274.21 - 277.91] talk to a a whole variety of 
[276.01 - 280.55] people and and just try and get 
[277.98 - 282.88] a handle on what it is that you 
[280.61 - 284.72] might look, you might be 
[282.95 - 285.92] expecting to experience. You 
[284.78 - 287.45] know, as a as a clinical 
[285.99 - 288.89] practitioner with diet and 
[287.52 - 292.56] nutrition, for me, when clients 
[288.95 - 294.03] sit across the table and did 
[292.62 - 295.63] they do come? Most women come 
[294.09 - 298.10] for fat loss. Well, first they 
[295.69 - 299.70] come for weight loss. And once 
[298.16 - 301.20] they start exercising and then 
[299.76 - 303.60] they do the weight loss. They 
[301.27 - 305.24] they like Ryan, I think my 
[303.67 - 306.51] cycles going haywire. So, 
[305.30 - 310.41] Phillip, my question to you 
[306.57 - 312.48] would be, especially the women 
[310.48 - 314.65] in the decade of 40s to 50s, 
[312.55 - 318.42] the decade 50s to 60s and 60s 
[314.71 - 319.25] to seventies. Are there certain 
[318.48 - 321.52] signs that a women should look 
[319.32 - 323.92] for in each of these decades? 
[321.59 - 325.69] Ah and what is your wisdom and 
[323.99 - 327.06] what is your experience with 
[325.76 - 328.53] your clients and you as a 
[327.13 - 330.46] women? What is your personal 
[328.59 - 332.00] experience? If you can 
[330.53 - 333.57] enlighten us on the three 
[332.06 - 336.50] decades, 40 to 50 50 to 60 and 
[333.63 - 338.47] may be 60 to seventy. Yes, of 
[336.57 - 340.41] course and ah and certainly 
[338.54 - 342.68] it's in your 40s when these 
[340.47 - 344.64] shifts begin to occur. The 
[342.74 - 346.95] shifting, a hormonal level to 
[344.71 - 350.38] occur and for a lot of women 
[347.01 - 352.58] it's around the age of 45. And 
[350.45 - 355.29] that was my experience. That at 
[352.65 - 357.52] the age of 45 something was 
[355.35 - 361.63] definitely a foot. Something 
[357.59 - 364.23] was happening. And so for me it 
[361.69 - 365.63] began really with gradually was 
[364.30 - 367.37] the other thing. So that it can 
[365.70 - 369.80] kind of creep up on you a 
[367.43 - 372.07] little bit. And so the symptoms 
[369.87 - 374.01] that I experienced was 
[372.14 - 376.67] sleeplessness, insomnia, really 
[374.07 - 378.04] having and and not so much that 
[376.74 - 381.58] I couldn't go to sleep but that 
[378.11 - 383.55] I couldn't stay asleep and I I 
[381.65 - 385.75] was waking regularly through 
[383.62 - 387.45] the night. Um so so I interrupt 
[385.82 - 388.59] you here for the the people 
[387.52 - 389.45] that are listening in, the 
[388.65 - 391.19] women that are listening and 
[389.52 - 392.69] they're watching the live or 
[391.26 - 395.03] the recorded later. Would you 
[392.76 - 397.90] say that a lot of women face 
[395.09 - 400.17] this issue of ah a sleep 
[397.96 - 402.00] irregularity? Yes, it's 
[400.23 - 405.94] actually very common. Um and 
[402.07 - 407.41] and so women who have never 
[406.00 - 410.01] experienced difficulties 
[407.47 - 411.41] sleeping before. I think the 
[410.08 - 414.15] experiences that they they may 
[411.48 - 415.71] not necessarily realise when 
[414.21 - 417.58] they wake that they haven't 
[415.78 - 419.72] been sleeping quite as well. 
[417.65 - 421.92] But they feel fatigued in the 
[419.79 - 423.52] morning when they wake up. Or 
[421.99 - 425.99] you are aware that you've been 
[423.59 - 428.53] disturbed in the night. And and 
[426.06 - 430.13] for me I was waking something 
[428.59 - 432.67] like six to eight times every 
[430.19 - 436.00] night which was unusual for me. 
[432.73 - 437.87] Needless to fatigue is a 
[436.07 - 440.51] symptoms of menopause and and 
[437.94 - 442.01] that gets very much tied in 
[440.57 - 444.14] with this sort of sleep 
[442.07 - 447.01] deprivation that a lot of women 
[444.21 - 448.38] are experiencing. Um you know 
[447.08 - 451.12] and and sleep is so 
[448.45 - 453.99] restorative. We need sleep. So 
[451.18 - 455.52] Phillipa if you were sitting 
[454.05 - 457.72] across the counselling table 
[455.59 - 458.42] for a diet plan with me. Now I 
[457.79 - 460.49] would be listening to this from 
[458.49 - 461.93] a clinical perspective. Oh, 
[460.56 - 463.30] she's got sleep problem. Oh, 
[461.99 - 464.96] she's got fatigue. So, I would 
[463.36 - 466.20] add a small layer from a 
[465.03 - 468.17] nutrition department which 
[466.26 - 470.10] would be, hey, Phillipa, could, 
[468.23 - 472.61] we check your vitamin B complex 
[470.17 - 476.01] in your blood? Could we check 
[472.67 - 477.78] your DHEA which goes low in 
[476.07 - 479.84] women during menopause as a 
[477.84 - 481.51] blood test? And may be can be 
[479.91 - 483.88] also look at vitamin C and 
[481.58 - 485.92] vitamin D. And there is another 
[483.95 - 489.49] thing. As you are growing older 
[485.99 - 492.22] you tend to deposit more fat 
[489.56 - 492.86] around your abdominal area. So 
[492.29 - 493.69] when you lie down. So if you 
[492.93 - 496.00] are standing, when you lie 
[493.76 - 497.83] down, your gut tends to push up 
[496.06 - 500.03] on your diaphragm. So this 
[497.90 - 501.80] another part of sleep apnea 
[500.10 - 502.57] also setting in. So there was 
[501.87 - 507.04] this research where when people 
[502.63 - 509.64] lost 4% body fat ah on on the 
[507.11 - 512.44] entire body especially ah the 
[509.71 - 515.75] neck ah girth came down then 
[512.51 - 518.15] the clogging of the ah the the 
[515.82 - 522.02] throat when breathing at night 
[518.22 - 524.52] ah reduced ah the the ah the 
[522.09 - 525.66] snoring which caused 
[524.59 - 527.76] intermittent sleeping so you go 
[525.73 - 530.16] into deep sleep you choke a and 
[527.83 - 531.20] then get up so there is 
[530.23 - 531.93] menopause which is sleep and 
[531.26 - 533.67] fatigue which you are talking 
[532.00 - 535.40] to me about and I would come in 
[533.73 - 537.57] from the biochemistry part and 
[535.47 - 538.37] say hey lady could we kind of 
[537.64 - 540.74] get ah a nutritional check and 
[538.44 - 541.91] see if any of going low because 
[540.81 - 544.64] they would be going low because 
[541.97 - 546.04] of the hormonal cycle. Yeah and 
[544.71 - 548.45] I mean I think that's really 
[546.11 - 551.15] important actually because 
[548.51 - 553.55] these kinds of complaints, my 
[551.22 - 555.12] experience was, I mean, let me 
[553.62 - 556.69] just be quite clear, that was 
[555.19 - 558.22] not the only symptoms that I 
[556.76 - 560.76] had, but we are talking about 
[558.29 - 563.10] sleep just now. And, and so if 
[560.83 - 564.63] you did go to your doctor, 
[563.16 - 567.63] complaining that sleep was 
[564.70 - 569.70] disturbed or disrupted. Um, you 
[567.70 - 571.00] know, first of all, they may 
[569.77 - 572.57] not even acknowledge that 
[571.07 - 573.87] menopause is a feature. And 
[572.64 - 576.54] secondly, it's unlikely that 
[573.94 - 579.84] you would be in anyway 
[576.61 - 582.28] investigated True. Very very 
[579.91 - 583.25] very true because it's like oh 
[582.35 - 585.52] it's okay. It's part of your 
[583.32 - 586.52] age and stuff like that and and 
[585.58 - 588.72] for me as a nutritionist I'm 
[586.59 - 590.25] looking at the biochemistry 
[588.79 - 591.69] cycles. So there is a 
[590.32 - 593.76] fluctuation between cortisol 
[591.76 - 594.56] levels, your estrogen levels 
[593.83 - 596.06] and all of these and they are 
[594.63 - 597.80] all interlinked. But there are 
[596.13 - 599.06] some quick tips and fixes that 
[597.86 - 601.73] I would give women out there 
[599.13 - 603.60] which would be one. Chamomile 
[601.80 - 604.67] tea. Research has shown that 
[603.67 - 606.97] chamomile tea gives you a 
[604.74 - 609.07] deeper sleep. Have a chamomile 
[607.04 - 610.51] about three hours before you 
[609.14 - 615.01] going to sleep. That's one. 
[610.58 - 617.42] Second is kiwi fruit. And 
[615.08 - 619.88] walnut and tart cherries. These 
[617.48 - 622.45] three are nature's sleeping 
[619.95 - 623.99] aids. They contain a higher 
[622.52 - 626.46] level of melatonin as compared 
[624.06 - 627.29] to other foods. So Phillipa if 
[626.52 - 629.53] women were out there I would 
[627.36 - 630.93] put a note down and say okay 
[629.60 - 632.97] may be with your chamomile tea. 
[631.00 - 633.80] Ah around six thirty-seven in 
[633.03 - 636.04] the evening have a walnut or 
[633.87 - 638.00] two. Ah and then the final 
[636.10 - 641.97] thing is an amino acid called 
[638.07 - 642.64] melatonin. Ah ah at around 1. 5 
[642.04 - 644.11] milligrams to about three 
[642.71 - 645.91] milligrams. It's a nutritional 
[644.18 - 647.85] supplement. So women who are 
[645.98 - 650.45] going through this transitional 
[647.91 - 651.55] period. Ah where million dollar 
[650.51 - 653.09] question Phillipa has your 
[651.62 - 658.02] sleep improved now over the 
[653.15 - 660.12] years? Well ehm, I'm, I'm 
[658.09 - 662.66] afraid to say, I'm a kind of a 
[660.19 - 665.13] lifelong, non-sleeper. Okay. 
[662.73 - 666.46] And so, you know, this is a 
[665.20 - 669.47] complicated issue for me 
[666.53 - 671.07] personally. But, you know, my 
[669.53 - 673.94] experiences that now that I'm 
[671.14 - 675.54] 54, and I'm, I'm don't look 
[674.01 - 679.24] fifty-four. Oh well, thank you 
[675.61 - 680.78] for saying this. That's the 
[679.31 - 683.38] only reason I mentioned it, of 
[680.85 - 684.72] course. Um, yeah, so I'm, you 
[683.45 - 687.65] know, I'm well through that 
[684.78 - 690.15] time now, it, in the menopausal 
[687.72 - 691.79] fluctuating period, And so yes, 
[690.22 - 695.06] you know, there is a suggestion 
[691.86 - 697.06] that symptoms can settle, after 
[695.13 - 699.70] that time, and so, certainly, 
[697.13 - 701.13] it is much improved, in 
[699.76 - 702.27] comparison to how it was, but 
[701.20 - 703.70] you know, I have to be 
[702.33 - 705.30] perfectly honest, Ryan, and 
[703.77 - 707.31] tell you that I had to resort 
[705.37 - 709.98] to hormonal replacement 
[707.37 - 711.68] therapy. For me, to be able to 
[710.04 - 714.85] get to that place and you know 
[711.74 - 717.05] and so you can see that I'm I'm 
[714.91 - 720.45] not carrying weight around my 
[717.12 - 723.29] neck and I'm I'm hopefully you 
[720.52 - 725.92] can see I'm not carrying weight 
[723.36 - 727.46] around my middle. Um you know 
[725.99 - 729.19] so so that there are always the 
[727.53 - 731.86] exceptions that prove the rule 
[729.26 - 734.13] but these hormonal fluctuations 
[731.93 - 737.87] are going on. Uh even in the 
[734.20 - 739.24] most healthy specimen and and 
[737.94 - 741.57] you know so it so it is 
[739.30 - 745.04] important to be able to have 
[741.64 - 746.98] access this kind of information 
[745.11 - 750.48] which is why I'm here chatting 
[747.05 - 751.38] with you today. Awesome. So, 
[750.55 - 753.25] for anyone listening in, we are 
[751.45 - 754.92] talking about sleep, fatigue. 
[753.32 - 756.95] It could be linked to your B-12 
[754.99 - 758.49] deficiency. It could be linked 
[757.02 - 761.13] to melatonin deficiency. In 
[758.56 - 762.96] fact, Philip, I'm working with 
[761.19 - 765.33] Doctor Stephen Dominic who is a 
[763.03 - 766.66] very famous doctor from Austria 
[765.40 - 769.10] who's written a book called the 
[766.73 - 770.64] Alkaline Cure. And we were just 
[769.17 - 771.44] having an offline discussion on 
[770.70 - 772.90] the health of the microbiome. 
[771.50 - 774.54] We've got lots to discuss 
[772.97 - 775.34] today. But sleep is also 
[774.61 - 779.31] controlled in your microbiome 
[775.41 - 780.41] and your microbi is all that 
[779.38 - 782.95] bacteria in your gut nearly two 
[780.48 - 784.68] KGs of it and trillions of them 
[783.01 - 787.05] actually chomp on your food 
[784.75 - 789.02] when you feed it and during the 
[787.12 - 790.86] the the transition from 
[789.09 - 791.62] perimenopause to menopause 
[790.92 - 793.06] There's. a lot of gut imbalance 
[791.69 - 794.19] because of the hormonal 
[793.12 - 796.53] fluctuation. In fact women have 
[794.26 - 798.03] told me that when they are in 
[796.60 - 799.43] normal menstruation cycle in 
[798.10 - 801.30] younger years. During the 
[799.50 - 803.57] periods of menstruation or the 
[801.37 - 804.94] days prior to menstruation they 
[803.64 - 807.77] do have bloating. Some women 
[805.00 - 810.01] come to the of even having 
[807.84 - 811.94] loose motions during their 
[810.08 - 813.28] periods. And you you kind of 
[812.01 - 814.41] think well what's the 
[813.35 - 817.01] menstruation got to do with 
[814.48 - 818.52] your digestive system? Your 
[817.08 - 820.62] your gut system going out of 
[818.58 - 822.59] toss. But research is now 
[820.68 - 824.46] showing that your microbiome 
[822.65 - 826.36] significantly controls your 
[824.52 - 830.00] sleep, controls your mood, 
[826.42 - 832.96] controls the longevity or delay 
[830.06 - 834.40] of menopause in women. So ah 
[833.03 - 837.24] when you talk about hormonal 
[834.47 - 839.81] therapy, I am up when it comes 
[837.30 - 842.47] from a doctor. Neither you nor 
[839.87 - 844.14] me are are equipped or 
[842.54 - 846.01] qualified to figure out the 
[844.21 - 847.98] hormonal balance after blood 
[846.08 - 849.38] test. Which is why we would 
[848.05 - 850.78] talk about exercise today and 
[849.45 - 852.15] we talk about nutrition today. 
[850.85 - 854.49] And that's something that I 
[852.22 - 856.12] believe every women is not 
[854.55 - 858.49] addressing and they are jumping 
[856.19 - 861.96] straight away into the medical 
[858.56 - 863.63] treatment. and leaving aside 
[862.03 - 865.20] nutrition on the plates to you 
[863.70 - 867.53] know I've eaten certain way in 
[865.26 - 870.87] my 20s to 40s. So I need to 
[867.60 - 872.77] kind of just continue that. Ah 
[870.94 - 875.34] Kul ah you've you've defined a 
[872.84 - 877.88] few ah stuff to me but there is 
[875.41 - 880.08] so much more this hot flashes 
[877.94 - 882.48] and there is ah you know pain 
[880.14 - 884.15] in the body ah there is lack of 
[882.55 - 887.02] sexual desire some women 
[884.22 - 889.59] getting sexual desire more ah 
[887.09 - 891.96] there is ah loads of ah body 
[889.65 - 893.56] fat getting deposited in areas 
[892.02 - 894.89] that and this is the number one 
[893.62 - 897.46] question I get when people walk 
[894.96 - 898.20] into my nutrition clinics is I 
[897.53 - 900.03] am putting on weight, I am 
[898.26 - 901.60] putting on weight, I am putting 
[900.10 - 902.80] on weight and in our part of 
[901.67 - 905.27] the world which is India ah 
[902.87 - 906.47] women take care of the family 
[905.34 - 907.94] first. I think they do that 
[906.54 - 910.71] everywhere. But over here ah 
[908.01 - 912.08] the the the predisposition to 
[910.78 - 914.15] take care of yourself first. 
[912.14 - 915.71] First take care of yourself 
[914.21 - 916.98] first and then you are you are 
[915.78 - 918.32] fit enough and and and your 
[917.05 - 919.45] your health is good enough to 
[918.38 - 922.45] take care of the rest of your 
[919.52 - 924.09] family. Ah is not a notion. So 
[922.52 - 925.99] let's start about taking care 
[924.16 - 927.66] of the body Filipa with you. 
[926.06 - 928.96] What are the what are the 
[927.73 - 931.80] things that you are advising 
[929.03 - 932.46] women beginning to start 
[931.86 - 934.47] perimenopause and getting into 
[932.53 - 938.37] menopause. important is 
[934.53 - 940.00] exercise for them? Well it's 
[938.44 - 942.44] it's absolutely crucial. It's 
[940.07 - 944.91] crucial at every stage of life 
[942.51 - 947.48] but never so important as in 
[944.98 - 950.68] midlife. And actually we can 
[947.54 - 953.22] gain as much if not more, if we 
[950.75 - 955.42] take up regular exercise in the 
[953.28 - 957.02] middle of our lives, then, if 
[955.49 - 959.99] we've been doing it all along, 
[957.09 - 961.99] and so, you know, this is, 
[960.06 - 963.50] doesn't age, doesn't have to be 
[962.06 - 967.23] a barrier, is what I would say. 
[963.56 - 969.23] And, the thing with exercises, 
[967.30 - 971.50] for some people, it's a dirty 
[969.30 - 974.97] word. Uh for me, it's my 
[971.57 - 975.74] absolute and utter passion. And 
[975.04 - 978.28] it's something that I've done 
[975.81 - 979.68] for my own health and well 
[978.34 - 981.98] being for the whole of my life. 
[979.75 - 984.55] Since I was a child in actual 
[982.05 - 987.19] fact. Uh I was inspired to 
[984.62 - 988.39] start sport, sporting pursuits 
[987.25 - 990.02] when I was only a child and 
[988.45 - 991.56] that was because of my family 
[990.09 - 993.03] influences. But you know, for 
[991.62 - 996.63] the most part, women in sport, 
[993.09 - 998.26] it tends to be if you do sports 
[996.70 - 1000.80] as a woman, it tends to go into 
[998.33 - 1003.50] a decline after the school 
[1000.87 - 1005.00] years. And for the majority of 
[1003.57 - 1006.80] women, exercise is not 
[1005.07 - 1008.51] necessarily a feature of every 
[1006.87 - 1010.48] day and that you know, women 
[1008.57 - 1011.41] are busy like you said, they're 
[1010.54 - 1014.01] busy taking care of everybody 
[1011.48 - 1015.48] else and it's really hard to 
[1014.08 - 1016.81] carve out time for yourself in 
[1015.55 - 1018.38] the middle of the day or in the 
[1016.88 - 1021.15] evening or you know, whenever 
[1018.45 - 1022.79] it is. But it's so so important 
[1021.22 - 1025.89] and you know, and so my mission 
[1022.86 - 1027.93] is to share the power of 
[1025.96 - 1030.63] movements with as many women, 
[1027.99 - 1032.03] as many people as possible. Uh 
[1030.70 - 1034.00] you know and for me my passion 
[1032.10 - 1038.00] is Pilates It. was my first 
[1034.07 - 1039.94] love when I came to Pilates I, 
[1038.07 - 1042.64] were, it was about 16 years ago 
[1040.01 - 1044.08] and and I came to Pilates 
[1042.71 - 1046.41] because actually, I I hurt my 
[1044.14 - 1048.51] back when I was working as a 
[1046.48 - 1050.68] physiotherapist and and it was 
[1048.58 - 1052.02] something that a colleague of 
[1050.75 - 1054.62] mine introduced me to in the 
[1052.08 - 1056.96] physiotherapy department 
[1054.69 - 1059.56] therapeutic or clinical Pilates 
[1057.02 - 1061.59] And. and so that started me on 
[1059.62 - 1063.73] my journey with Pilates and you 
[1061.66 - 1065.56] know I had my first training 
[1063.80 - 1067.66] course. Only a weekend and at 
[1065.63 - 1069.10] the end of the weekend my back 
[1067.73 - 1071.77] pain was feeling a whole lot 
[1069.17 - 1073.40] better. And I was kind of like 
[1071.84 - 1075.41] oh my goodness. You know this 
[1073.47 - 1076.91] is incredible stuff. So so 
[1075.47 - 1077.58] Phillipa because we have got 
[1076.97 - 1080.01] quite a number of people 
[1077.64 - 1081.48] watching in. Oh yes. I don't 
[1080.08 - 1085.05] know what is Pilates. What is 
[1081.55 - 1085.05] Pilates? I'm hearing 
[1087.02 - 1089.95] term for the first time. I am a 
[1088.35 - 1091.46] nutritionist. What is Pilates? 
[1090.02 - 1094.29] Is? it a dance that I do or 
[1091.52 - 1096.53] something like that? No, well, 
[1094.36 - 1099.80] do you know what? Uh Joseph 
[1096.60 - 1102.30] Pilates was a gentleman and he 
[1099.87 - 1104.60] was German by descent and in 
[1102.37 - 1105.90] actual fact, it majority of his 
[1104.67 - 1108.51] career was spent in New York 
[1105.97 - 1110.41] and he did work with Prima 
[1108.57 - 1112.54] Ballerinas. So, there are quite 
[1110.47 - 1116.05] a few dance influences in 
[1112.61 - 1118.82] Pilates and Pilates is really 
[1116.11 - 1119.75] just a series of exercises but 
[1118.88 - 1120.59] Pilates is much more about the 
[1119.82 - 1122.92] how. How do we move? How do we 
[1120.65 - 1125.49] do these exercise Uh these 
[1122.99 - 1127.93] exercises. Pilates is about 
[1125.56 - 1129.49] body position or body 
[1127.99 - 1132.36] alignment. Pilates is about 
[1129.56 - 1134.70] core activation or the core 
[1132.43 - 1136.47] muscles. Uh Pilates And. why is 
[1134.77 - 1138.70] why is this important for women 
[1136.54 - 1140.54] in menopause? I mean why is the 
[1138.77 - 1141.67] core important? Could as a 
[1140.61 - 1142.87] physiotherapist could it tell 
[1141.74 - 1144.11] me because you know when I tell 
[1142.94 - 1145.91] my clients as interested as you 
[1144.18 - 1148.05] need to do Pilates. You need to 
[1145.98 - 1149.45] do you oh god? Do you know 
[1148.11 - 1150.92] you're growing older and your 
[1149.51 - 1152.68] fat is getting larger and 
[1150.98 - 1155.12] larger and your muscles getting 
[1152.75 - 1156.25] smaller and smaller. And muscle 
[1155.19 - 1157.45] is the only age reversible 
[1156.32 - 1159.19] organ for a women going through 
[1157.52 - 1161.56] menopause So, if she can grow 
[1159.26 - 1162.99] more muscle. Yeah. She would, 
[1161.63 - 1166.10] she would hold back on the fat 
[1163.06 - 1168.17] growing out of range. So, you 
[1166.16 - 1169.53] know, tell me a little bit more 
[1168.23 - 1170.67] about how Pilates is going to 
[1169.60 - 1173.77] help the core and stuff like 
[1170.74 - 1176.51] that. Well, because we apply 
[1173.84 - 1178.94] the mind, muscle connection and 
[1176.57 - 1180.55] specifically to the deep layer 
[1179.01 - 1184.01] of muscles that surround the 
[1180.61 - 1184.02] spine, the the 
[1190.59 - 1198.50] centre of the body. And if we 
[1194.46 - 1201.63] can you know because those 
[1198.56 - 1204.07] muscles actually, the, the core 
[1201.70 - 1206.97] muscles for the most part, are 
[1204.14 - 1211.34] stability muscles. And the 
[1207.04 - 1216.11] muscles that automatically 
[1211.41 - 1221.75] should switch on as we go about 
[1216.18 - 1227.66] our daily lives. If you stand 
[1221.82 - 1231.16] on one leg to reach a high 
[1227.73 - 1236.80] shelf, you know, without the 
[1231.23 - 1240.97] core, you would fall over. So, 
[1236.87 - 1245.71] so those muscles are automatic, 
[1241.04 - 1247.61] but for lots of people, they 
[1245.78 - 1248.28] kind of forget how to work I'm 
[1247.68 - 1249.01] thinking of a woman who is 55 
[1248.35 - 1249.95] reaching up on her and to take 
[1249.08 - 1250.65] a bottle off the shelf in the 
[1250.02 - 1251.25] kitchen. And is this where this 
[1250.71 - 1253.15] the hip problem and the bone 
[1251.32 - 1258.56] problem and I fell down and 
[1253.22 - 1262.33] broke my hip later. Is it 
[1258.62 - 1270.40] linked to menopause And? can we 
[1262.39 - 1275.04] then maybe discuss with all our 
[1270.47 - 1279.58] viewers how important it is to 
[1275.11 - 1283.01] maybe muscle train, a weight 
[1279.64 - 1286.15] train and then you have you 
[1283.08 - 1288.42] know a Filipa ICU right now is 
[1286.22 - 1289.22] a car dealer. You've got all 
[1288.49 - 1290.02] your car over there. You got 
[1289.29 - 1290.65] Pilates you, got yoga, you got 
[1290.09 - 1291.56] weight training, you got 
[1290.72 - 1292.16] running, you got marathon. Ah 
[1291.62 - 1293.06] what else? I mean ah what 
[1292.22 - 1293.92] should a women going through 
[1293.12 - 1294.69] menopause do because she's got 
[1293.99 - 1295.46] seven days a week. Should she 
[1294.76 - 1296.29] work out all seven days? And 
[1295.53 - 1297.23] how much of time should she 
[1296.36 - 1300.60] devote to her body in Pilates 
[1297.30 - 1304.47] or anything else that we just 
[1300.66 - 1309.61] I'm asking you about. Well for 
[1304.54 - 1314.38] the most part exercise needs to 
[1309.67 - 1316.78] be regular for the benefits to 
[1314.45 - 1317.68] be realised and maintained So 
[1316.85 - 1318.42] it's really unfortunate and it 
[1317.75 - 1319.25] did you know it's the same with 
[1318.48 - 1320.05] nutrition. If we don't stick to 
[1319.32 - 1320.92] the plan then things start to 
[1320.12 - 1321.99] go awry. And so with movement 
[1320.99 - 1322.79] it really is a a practice for 
[1322.05 - 1323.66] life. It's a practice for every 
[1322.85 - 1324.39] day and it's a practice for 
[1323.72 - 1325.16] life. So you know in an ideal 
[1324.46 - 1325.99] world we would do something 
[1325.22 - 1326.69] every day. But what I would say 
[1326.06 - 1327.56] is five days out of seven that 
[1326.76 - 1328.16] you should be doing something. 
[1327.63 - 1328.79] Yeah. Five days. So so I'm 
[1328.23 - 1329.43] doing because Phillipa when 
[1328.86 - 1330.16] this video gets recorded and 
[1329.49 - 1331.06] goes back on to our YouTube 
[1330.23 - 1331.83] channels. It's going to pop up 
[1331.13 - 1332.53] here on the site. You gotta 
[1331.90 - 1333.30] work out five days a week and 
[1332.60 - 1333.96] for how long? Well, you know, 
[1333.37 - 1334.67] this this lots of different 
[1334.03 - 1335.60] guidance out there but you're 
[1334.73 - 1336.37] look in somewhere in the region 
[1335.67 - 1337.07] of thirty minutes, five times a 
[1336.43 - 1337.87] week, and maybe, you know, 
[1337.13 - 1338.60] that's that's kind of a minimum 
[1337.94 - 1339.30] really. I like, do you know, as 
[1338.67 - 1342.37] I like Ryan, I like counting my 
[1339.37 - 1342.37] steps. I like 
[1351.38 - 1359.92] yeah I've got one too. There 
[1355.02 - 1363.89] you go. It's hiding. I'm at 
[1359.99 - 1365.60] 5000 today because I'm standing 
[1363.96 - 1372.50] up and and doing my lecture 
[1365.66 - 1375.41] with you. Ah but but just just 
[1372.57 - 1378.88] one thing that I want to get 
[1375.47 - 1382.01] our audience in over here. And 
[1378.94 - 1382.01] I've got 
[1397.06 - 1407.47] my team running this live. Um 
[1403.57 - 1411.28] comment on the live. How many 
[1407.54 - 1416.95] steps you do in a day? Number 
[1411.34 - 1422.15] one And as a women if you are 
[1417.02 - 1425.99] watching this how much of time 
[1422.22 - 1429.46] in a workout could you devote 
[1426.06 - 1434.57] to your body for a workout? Is 
[1429.53 - 1437.97] it 30 minutes? Filipa the 
[1434.63 - 1441.24] expert. The Pilates expert, the 
[1438.04 - 1443.44] charted physiotherapist, the 
[1441.31 - 1444.08] person who has gone through 
[1443.51 - 1444.61] menopause. She is the expert 
[1444.14 - 1445.28] here, not me. I'm just a 
[1444.67 - 1445.88] nutritionist. She is saying you 
[1445.34 - 1446.61] need to do more than 30 
[1445.94 - 1447.21] minutes, 30 to 40 minutes. As a 
[1446.68 - 1447.78] nutritionist, I would say, 
[1447.28 - 1448.31] well, if you could do 40 
[1447.85 - 1448.91] minutes to one hour of 
[1448.38 - 1449.48] resistance training, Pilates 
[1448.98 - 1450.15] Training, Yoga Training, I 
[1449.55 - 1450.85] would give that but most women 
[1450.21 - 1451.51] turn around say ah Mr. Fernando 
[1450.91 - 1452.18] ah I you don't run a house, we 
[1451.58 - 1452.85] run a house, we run a husband, 
[1452.25 - 1453.52] we run a children. So you have 
[1452.92 - 1454.18] no idea, we have no time for 
[1453.58 - 1454.79] ourselves, you know. So, ah, ah 
[1454.25 - 1455.42] just just give us a diet, 
[1454.85 - 1455.99] right? So, please comment on 
[1455.49 - 1456.52] the links below and if any 
[1456.05 - 1457.15] women out there have any 
[1456.59 - 1457.79] questions, please punch them 
[1457.22 - 1458.46] in. I'm going to ask them to 
[1457.86 - 1459.09] fill a bar. So, hopefully your 
[1458.52 - 1459.72] question on exercise can get 
[1459.16 - 1460.39] answered. Coming back to you 
[1459.79 - 1460.99] Phillipa Um Well, you know, you 
[1460.46 - 1461.86] were talking about how much 
[1461.06 - 1462.53] should we move? But but really 
[1461.93 - 1463.43] we do need to break it down 
[1462.59 - 1464.06] into the types of things that 
[1463.49 - 1465.03] we're doing because not all 
[1464.13 - 1465.86] exercise is equal, sadly. And 
[1465.10 - 1466.70] you did make a reference to 
[1465.93 - 1469.73] muscle mass, building muscle 
[1466.77 - 1472.94] mass is so, so important, and 
[1469.80 - 1477.97] particularly for women, we, you 
[1473.00 - 1484.71] know, we reach peak muscle mass 
[1478.04 - 1484.71] in our late twenties. 
[1485.15 - 1489.79] You know, that's. Phillipa why, 
[1487.35 - 1492.79] don't, why don't you look like 
[1489.85 - 1497.90] Anil Schwarzenegger? Because 
[1492.86 - 1501.77] women always tell me, I can't 
[1497.96 - 1504.00] do weight training. I will 
[1501.83 - 1504.67] become a body builder. And I'm 
[1504.07 - 1505.37] like, no, you can so could you 
[1504.74 - 1506.14] like I love that you are 
[1505.44 - 1507.07] telling me that women should 
[1506.20 - 1507.94] weight train tell me about more 
[1507.14 - 1508.54] about this weight training and 
[1508.01 - 1509.41] muscle mass. Well, you know, 
[1508.61 - 1510.01] particularly with Pilates what, 
[1509.47 - 1510.81] we're doing with is working 
[1510.08 - 1511.61] muscles in a lengthened 
[1510.88 - 1512.28] position, in a lengthened 
[1511.68 - 1512.91] fashion. And so, resistance 
[1512.34 - 1513.58] training, like Arnold 
[1512.98 - 1514.21] Schwarzenegger and actually, 
[1513.64 - 1515.11] I'm a huge fan of Arnold 
[1514.28 - 1515.78] Schwartz and they're going, I 
[1515.18 - 1516.41] love mussels. I'll be back. 
[1515.85 - 1517.05] Yeah, so but you know, to, in 
[1516.48 - 1517.71] order to generate that peak, 
[1517.12 - 1518.35] the peak of muscle as my son 
[1517.78 - 1518.98] whose body building calls it, 
[1518.42 - 1519.62] you know, you you work muscles 
[1519.05 - 1520.28] into a shortened position in 
[1519.68 - 1521.09] order to generate that effect 
[1520.35 - 1525.16] and so, we can totally get 
[1521.15 - 1527.66] strong without getting bulky if 
[1525.22 - 1532.30] that's what women are worried 
[1527.73 - 1535.60] about. And in actual fact, you 
[1532.36 - 1539.34] know, you know the muscle 
[1535.67 - 1544.74] drives the metabolic rate and 
[1539.40 - 1550.55] so the more muscle mass we got, 
[1544.81 - 1554.12] the, the, the more our 
[1550.62 - 1554.99] metabolism is working in our 
[1554.18 - 1555.89] favour. You know, for I've got 
[1555.05 - 1556.69] a few comments going live on 
[1555.95 - 1557.49] our our Facebook channels and 
[1556.76 - 1558.09] we have got Gautamy and Anupa 
[1557.56 - 1558.82] talking about doing 8, 000 
[1558.16 - 1559.52] steps in yoga. So, to a lot of 
[1558.89 - 1560.06] women out there doing the yoga, 
[1559.59 - 1560.89] I would come in and say 
[1560.12 - 1561.59] research has shown twice a week 
[1560.96 - 1563.19] and Filipa, you can, you can 
[1561.66 - 1569.90] agree or you know, say it's 
[1563.26 - 1573.97] more or less but twice a week, 
[1569.97 - 1578.14] weight training for 45 minutes 
[1574.04 - 1580.64] and for me, muscle is the only 
[1578.21 - 1581.25] age reversible organ and and I 
[1580.71 - 1581.91] would come in and tell the 
[1581.31 - 1582.61] audience that I use this line 
[1581.98 - 1583.31] always in my consequences I'm. 
[1582.68 - 1583.95] like you know in America, they 
[1583.38 - 1584.55] had these two buildings and it 
[1584.02 - 1585.28] was an old age home. In the 
[1584.62 - 1585.95] basement of one, they gave them 
[1585.35 - 1586.65] a gaming studio and a 
[1586.02 - 1587.38] entertainment center and in the 
[1586.72 - 1588.15] other basement, they put in a 
[1587.45 - 1588.79] gym. So, the the old age people 
[1588.22 - 1591.36] was 70 plus. They started 
[1588.85 - 1592.32] grumbling about oh the other 
[1591.42 - 1594.16] buildings got a gaming center 
[1592.39 - 1595.53] and you've given us a gym. But 
[1594.22 - 1597.49] the scientist prevailed and 
[1595.59 - 1598.20] gave them some incentive and 
[1597.56 - 1599.06] they took biopsies of quadricep 
[1598.26 - 1599.86] muscle. The quadricep muscle is 
[1599.13 - 1600.53] the muscle you know above ah 
[1599.93 - 1601.20] just near your knee. And they 
[1600.60 - 1601.87] found out ah they did for both 
[1601.27 - 1602.37] the groups. And they said okay 
[1601.93 - 1603.00] the group that had the 
[1602.43 - 1603.57] entertainment centre. Hey guys, 
[1603.07 - 1604.13] hey ladies, all of you old 
[1603.63 - 1604.80] people. You know ah enjoy 
[1604.20 - 1607.40] yourself, watch TV, play games, 
[1604.87 - 1608.47] play ah bridge and stuff like 
[1607.47 - 1611.24] that. The other place they they 
[1608.54 - 1612.44] made them do leg extensions 
[1611.31 - 1613.91] which is basically an exercise 
[1612.51 - 1614.88] and they walk them through a 40 
[1613.98 - 1615.48] minute three times a week. 
[1614.94 - 1616.15] Training regime and another 
[1615.55 - 1616.75] three times a week slow walking 
[1616.21 - 1617.35] on a treadmill. Six months 
[1616.81 - 1617.98] later Phillipa and everybody 
[1617.41 - 1618.65] who tuned it six months later 
[1618.05 - 1619.22] these average 72 year olds the 
[1618.72 - 1619.92] group that was entertained 
[1619.28 - 1620.42] their muscle biopsy grew older. 
[1619.98 - 1621.15] But the scientist were 
[1620.48 - 1621.95] astonished when they took the 
[1621.22 - 1622.59] muscle biopsy of the group that 
[1622.02 - 1624.86] started weight training. They 
[1622.65 - 1626.79] had regressed by six years in 
[1624.92 - 1630.80] age in the muscle biopsy. So 
[1626.86 - 1632.60] for me That is proof in the 
[1630.86 - 1635.27] pudding saying to everybody 
[1632.66 - 1636.83] going through menopause Pick up 
[1635.33 - 1639.17] a set of dumbbells, pick up a 
[1636.90 - 1641.61] set of resistance tubes, find a 
[1639.24 - 1642.94] person like Phillipa Butler 
[1641.67 - 1644.71] I'm. going to be putting her 
[1643.01 - 1647.11] contact details, her website, 
[1644.78 - 1648.14] so you can email her, you can 
[1647.18 - 1649.58] get in touch with her, you can 
[1648.21 - 1652.02] watch her online videos, her 
[1649.65 - 1655.29] online classes and figure out 
[1652.08 - 1656.35] how you can do more what I call 
[1655.35 - 1659.06] is muscle training. Phillipa, 
[1656.42 - 1661.43] back to you. other words of 
[1659.12 - 1663.16] wisdom from the exercise world. 
[1661.49 - 1664.63] Well, you know, you you 
[1663.23 - 1666.16] mentioned that two times a 
[1664.70 - 1668.03] week. So, it's two or three 
[1666.23 - 1669.63] times a week to do resistance 
[1668.10 - 1672.17] training. It's two or three 
[1669.70 - 1673.50] times a week to do mobility, 
[1672.24 - 1676.54] flexibility type training. What 
[1673.57 - 1678.21] is mobility? Mobility. Well, 
[1676.61 - 1680.38] improving the race. Is it 
[1678.28 - 1682.15] dancing? Well, it could be. 
[1680.44 - 1684.48] Like I said, again, but it's 
[1682.21 - 1685.98] basically the the the amount of 
[1684.55 - 1687.92] movement that you have in each 
[1686.05 - 1690.02] joint in your body You know, in 
[1687.99 - 1691.72] an ideal world, we should put 
[1690.09 - 1694.06] every joint in our body through 
[1691.79 - 1697.76] its full range of motion every 
[1694.12 - 1699.36] day. And you know, I can pretty 
[1697.83 - 1703.07] much guarantee nobody's doing 
[1699.43 - 1704.87] that. But you know what if use 
[1703.13 - 1706.87] it or lose it as the saying 
[1704.94 - 1708.51] goes. It's you know it's 
[1706.94 - 1710.54] absolutely and utterly true. 
[1708.57 - 1713.58] There's I love that line. Use 
[1710.61 - 1716.48] it or lose it. Yeah. So we are 
[1713.64 - 1718.58] talking about this to women. 
[1716.55 - 1721.59] Women have fat. Women have 
[1718.65 - 1723.22] bone. Women have muscle. If you 
[1721.65 - 1726.49] don't use your muscle and if 
[1723.29 - 1728.06] you don't stimulate your bone 
[1726.56 - 1728.76] to to become denser through 
[1728.13 - 1730.56] resistance training. You're 
[1728.83 - 1733.53] going to lose it. These are 
[1730.63 - 1734.70] wise words from your certified 
[1733.60 - 1735.47] Pilates instructor Phillipa 
[1734.77 - 1737.63] Butler. Now Phillipa I want to 
[1735.53 - 1740.07] bring something about nutrition 
[1737.70 - 1744.24] over here. Ah research has 
[1740.14 - 1746.51] shown that most women want to 
[1744.31 - 1747.11] take up dieting When they go 
[1746.58 - 1748.41] through menopause. Because. 
[1747.18 - 1750.71] they are putting on weight. 
[1748.48 - 1752.48] Yeah. Right? Ah they are 
[1750.78 - 1754.75] gaining weight. First thing to 
[1752.55 - 1755.95] women who are much younger not 
[1754.82 - 1759.09] going through menopause right 
[1756.02 - 1762.43] now. This is a a fact. Women 
[1759.16 - 1764.56] will gain one to two KGs or two 
[1762.49 - 1767.03] to four pounds of weight. In 
[1764.63 - 1768.53] any given day, in any given 
[1767.10 - 1769.73] month, when they are going 
[1768.60 - 1770.93] through a menstruation cycle. 
[1769.80 - 1773.54] So the first thing I advise 
[1771.00 - 1775.07] women is do not stand on the 
[1773.61 - 1776.67] scale first thing in the 
[1775.14 - 1778.61] morning and oh my god, I have 
[1776.74 - 1780.14] gained one KG of weight and 
[1778.68 - 1782.58] then you decide whether that's 
[1780.21 - 1783.71] a bad day or that's a good day. 
[1782.65 - 1785.12] So, this is the first 
[1783.78 - 1786.82] perspective of controlling your 
[1785.18 - 1788.79] body from a nutrition expert 
[1786.88 - 1791.66] and from an exercise expert. 
[1788.85 - 1794.36] The fluctuation of one to2KGs 
[1791.72 - 1796.96] is natural. Hmm. Number one, 
[1794.42 - 1798.46] number two, from a nutrition 
[1797.03 - 1801.63] perspective, when people go on 
[1798.53 - 1802.90] a diet and they lose weight, 
[1801.70 - 1806.00] they are not aware of the 
[1802.97 - 1806.00] person 
[1810.38 - 1821.15] of body fat and the percentage 
[1815.78 - 1824.36] of muscle. So, my 
[1821.22 - 1829.23] recommendation to every women 
[1824.42 - 1835.07] out there is gift yourself this 
[1829.29 - 1839.60] Christmas a wing scale and when 
[1835.13 - 1843.67] you are buying the scale from 
[1839.67 - 1848.71] the department store, say, hey 
[1843.74 - 1851.78] buddy, does this wing scale 
[1848.78 - 1851.78] have 
[1852.15 - 1860.22] a body fat percentage 
[1856.15 - 1866.00] calculator and will it tell me 
[1860.29 - 1868.30] my muscle mass? Does it sink to 
[1866.06 - 1875.01] my phone? So, I can get that 
[1868.37 - 1878.84] data and does it tell me my 
[1875.07 - 1882.01] visceral thought, Visceral 
[1878.91 - 1885.85] thought is the fat around the 
[1882.08 - 1886.55] organs which for most 
[1885.92 - 1887.32] menopausal women is a biggest 
[1886.62 - 1888.05] threat for cardiovascular 
[1887.38 - 1888.85] disease and hypertension. So, 
[1888.12 - 1889.89] if you can keep your visceral 
[1888.92 - 1890.79] fat down in the single digits, 
[1889.95 - 1891.96] so you have one, two, three, 4, 
[1890.86 - 1892.66] 5, 6, 789 So up to nine if I 
[1892.02 - 1893.42] meet a woman, I'm like, don't 
[1892.72 - 1898.40] worry ma'am, it's absolutely 
[1893.49 - 1902.10] fine. If you walk ten 000 steps 
[1898.46 - 1906.17] a day, 10, 000 steps a day, 
[1902.17 - 1911.38] that's weight maintenance. Oh, 
[1906.24 - 1913.51] Mr. Ryan, I walk 6, 000 steps a 
[1911.44 - 1918.02] day. I walk 8, 000 steps a day 
[1913.58 - 1918.95] but I am not losing any weight. 
[1918.08 - 1919.75] 10 000 is weight maintenance. 
[1919.02 - 1920.62] If you want to eat into your 
[1919.82 - 1921.52] fat, you've got to go beyond 
[1920.68 - 1922.35] 10, 000 steps. Now, Filipa and 
[1921.59 - 1923.25] I and you all use cars today. 
[1922.42 - 1924.05] We use elevators. So, we've got 
[1923.32 - 1924.86] to take the time out. Because 
[1924.12 - 1925.62] if we don't use it, we are 
[1924.92 - 1926.42] going to lose it. Use it. Yeah, 
[1925.69 - 1927.19] I mean, you know, the the the 
[1926.49 - 1927.96] first thing we should do is 
[1927.26 - 1928.66] think about composition as you 
[1928.03 - 1929.69] say, because weight, weight is 
[1928.72 - 1933.33] a very crude measure. Um you 
[1929.76 - 1936.20] know, just on its own, it's a 
[1933.40 - 1944.41] number like you say and it 
[1936.27 - 1952.32] fluctuates on a daily basis. Um 
[1944.47 - 1957.39] I I really wanting to encourage 
[1952.38 - 1963.73] people to think about how they 
[1957.45 - 1963.73] feel and you know, 
[1963.89 - 1972.94] weight training, it's going to 
[1969.00 - 1973.87] really shift that brain 
[1973.00 - 1974.54] chemistry It's going to make us 
[1973.94 - 1975.41] feel better. When we feel 
[1974.61 - 1976.07] better. We're more motivated to 
[1975.47 - 1976.97] stick to the healthy life 
[1976.14 - 1977.74] choices that we know we need to 
[1977.04 - 1978.41] make. And so, you know, the 
[1977.81 - 1979.18] thing that I've experienced for 
[1978.48 - 1979.98] my own self is low mood with 
[1979.24 - 1980.74] with menopause and and that can 
[1980.04 - 1983.68] really fuel that cycle of mood 
[1980.81 - 1989.82] and low mood and retrieving 
[1983.75 - 1993.29] food from the biscuits barrel 
[1989.89 - 1996.43] that maybe isn't quite as 
[1993.36 - 1997.09] healthy as we would like. So, 
[1996.49 - 1997.73] boost your mood with movements 
[1997.16 - 1998.43] is the other thing, you know. 
[1997.80 - 1999.20] So, that's a very valid point. 
[1998.49 - 1999.80] Boost your, your mood and I 
[1999.26 - 2000.46] think every woman who goes 
[1999.86 - 2001.27] through menopause will have the 
[2000.53 - 2001.93] fluctuations of the mood. Uh 
[2001.33 - 2002.57] research is showing that 
[2002.00 - 2006.80] exercise plays a key role in 
[2002.63 - 2014.24] balancing cortisol levels and 
[2006.87 - 2020.22] blood circulation too. Um I 
[2014.31 - 2025.46] I've actually seen very very 
[2020.28 - 2030.63] fit marathon runners. Very very 
[2025.52 - 2032.60] fit people like Filipa who are 
[2030.69 - 2033.26] instructors. Um they, they, 
[2032.66 - 2034.00] they understand that they can 
[2033.33 - 2034.70] use exercise as a drug. It's a 
[2034.07 - 2035.37] very powerful drug. Exercise is 
[2034.77 - 2036.00] a very powerful drug. In fact, 
[2035.43 - 2036.53] the reason I got online with 
[2036.07 - 2039.17] Phillipa is that I've 
[2036.60 - 2042.87] understood that yoga, Pilates 
[2039.24 - 2048.98] these, are very powerful for 
[2042.94 - 2054.39] women in terms of the core 
[2049.05 - 2058.62] strength, the bone strength and 
[2054.45 - 2063.23] even something like yoga which 
[2058.69 - 2064.03] your different poses actually 
[2063.29 - 2064.80] massage in internal organs. And 
[2064.09 - 2065.33] I think even you, the audience 
[2064.86 - 2066.10] knows that exercise is 
[2065.40 - 2067.03] important. But I think there is 
[2066.16 - 2067.83] a, there is a slip between the 
[2067.10 - 2068.57] cup and the lip in terms of do 
[2067.90 - 2069.83] I have the time? Am I making 
[2068.63 - 2073.84] the time for my body? Ah, and, 
[2069.90 - 2077.64] and how important it is. So, 
[2073.91 - 2084.48] today me and Philip are teamed 
[2077.71 - 2084.48] up to try and convince you that 
[2084.78 - 2094.62] like you spend time getting a 
[2091.72 - 2097.60] shower, like you spend time 
[2094.69 - 2100.43] visiting the parlor, like you 
[2097.66 - 2103.03] spend time doing your shopping, 
[2100.50 - 2104.90] like you spend time may be 
[2103.10 - 2105.60] tucking your in, like you spend 
[2104.97 - 2106.34] time going for a walk with your 
[2105.67 - 2107.10] spouse. You need to have your 
[2106.40 - 2108.04] me time and your me time is not 
[2107.17 - 2108.74] only may be having a cuppa but 
[2108.11 - 2109.74] your me time is also saying, 
[2108.81 - 2110.54] let me get to the gym and let 
[2109.81 - 2111.44] me become superwoman because I 
[2110.61 - 2112.08] think this is really important. 
[2111.51 - 2112.51] If you know your muscle 
[2112.14 - 2113.24] percentage, you can 
[2112.58 - 2113.91] significantly use your muscles 
[2113.31 - 2117.11] to get your body into into 
[2113.98 - 2118.52] shape and and and it is the 
[2117.18 - 2120.65] hormones that are not 
[2118.58 - 2122.05] cooperating with you but if you 
[2120.72 - 2122.79] do train and not become a couch 
[2122.12 - 2123.39] potato, you will see that you 
[2122.85 - 2124.02] will walk through your 
[2123.45 - 2124.66] menopause far easier and 
[2124.09 - 2125.16] research shows this. Women who 
[2124.72 - 2125.69] exercise through their 
[2125.22 - 2126.42] menopause and the initial 
[2125.76 - 2127.19] phases including hot flushes, 
[2126.49 - 2127.92] significantly improve ah on on 
[2127.26 - 2128.69] the perspective of exercise. 
[2127.99 - 2129.49] So, I guess it is important for 
[2128.76 - 2130.13] us to talk about how we fuel 
[2129.56 - 2130.76] that, that growth. How do we 
[2130.19 - 2132.46] feel those muscles? Because, 
[2130.83 - 2133.76] you know, exercise is part of 
[2132.53 - 2134.36] the equation. Well, you know, I 
[2133.83 - 2135.00] like to it's half of the 
[2134.43 - 2135.80] equation at least. But your 
[2135.07 - 2136.50] nutrition is undoubtedly a 
[2135.87 - 2137.50] source of confusion for lots 
[2136.57 - 2138.20] and lots of people. And so we 
[2137.57 - 2139.17] want to fuel the body for for 
[2138.27 - 2140.00] muscle and bone. So so Phillipa 
[2139.24 - 2140.64] if if somebody comes into me so 
[2140.07 - 2141.64] let's say you're coming and 
[2140.70 - 2142.27] you're my client right? And I 
[2141.71 - 2143.61] would say hey Filipa, let's get 
[2142.34 - 2144.51] a blood test done. By Ryan, why 
[2143.67 - 2146.38] do I need a blood test? Well, 
[2144.57 - 2147.58] I'd like to know your vitamins 
[2146.44 - 2148.28] and minerals, right? Now, when 
[2147.64 - 2149.01] you reach menopause you need to 
[2148.34 - 2149.68] understand that your your a 
[2149.08 - 2150.38] good three, four, five decades 
[2149.75 - 2151.01] into your life. Yes. And if you 
[2150.45 - 2151.68] are into those many decades, 
[2151.08 - 2152.32] your digestive system is like 
[2151.75 - 2152.95] kind of tired and saying, you 
[2152.38 - 2154.78] know what, oh, you give me a 
[2153.02 - 2156.05] glass of milk. Let me decide if 
[2154.85 - 2157.65] I want to absorb this calcium 
[2156.12 - 2158.96] or not. So, with the blood 
[2157.72 - 2160.62] test, we know transient levels. 
[2159.02 - 2164.56] The second thing Phillipa now, 
[2160.69 - 2167.03] in 2021 and 2022, we have got 
[2164.63 - 2168.60] genetic testing. Wow. Nutrition 
[2167.10 - 2170.73] genetic testing. So, I found 
[2168.67 - 2172.27] out that we can check all the 
[2170.80 - 2175.54] nutrition markers. For example, 
[2172.34 - 2177.54] follic a it, vitamin B9 is so 
[2175.61 - 2179.91] important for moods. Vitamin B6 
[2177.61 - 2181.61] and niacine are so important 
[2179.98 - 2183.58] for lowering cholesterol. Now, 
[2181.68 - 2185.62] what if you are born with a 
[2183.65 - 2187.62] gene that doesn't absorb niacin 
[2185.68 - 2189.15] well? And you have a high 
[2187.68 - 2191.62] cholesterol. Now, suddenly 
[2189.22 - 2193.09] doctor is giving you statin. 
[2191.69 - 2193.82] Yes. In your menopause and 
[2193.16 - 2195.76] because you are taking statin, 
[2193.89 - 2197.23] it has a long term effect on 
[2195.83 - 2198.86] your muscle health. So, you 
[2197.29 - 2200.06] tend to get fatigued and tired. 
[2198.93 - 2201.20] Now, I need to give you 
[2200.13 - 2202.00] coenzyme Qten but I'm deviating 
[2201.26 - 2204.97] over here. Coming back. Genetic 
[2202.07 - 2206.57] test I come to know whether you 
[2205.04 - 2208.87] are lactose intolerant, gluten 
[2206.64 - 2211.98] intolerant. So, should you want 
[2208.94 - 2213.68] to be making these educated 
[2212.04 - 2215.18] scientific decisions rather 
[2213.74 - 2217.62] than, oh, you know, butter my 
[2215.25 - 2218.62] neighbour, she followed this 
[2217.68 - 2221.05] intermittent fasting and lost 
[2218.68 - 2222.72] five KGs. So if Berta could 
[2221.12 - 2224.95] lose five KGs, I'm going to go 
[2222.79 - 2227.12] on to Bertha's diet. Hmm. It's 
[2225.02 - 2231.03] bio individual in 2021. I, I 
[2227.19 - 2232.00] was, I was, I was wearing a 
[2231.09 - 2233.06] glucose monitor recently, I'm 
[2232.06 - 2236.17] not diabetic. But I was shocked 
[2233.13 - 2238.04] if find out for me white rice 
[2236.23 - 2239.20] gives me a sugar spike but 
[2238.10 - 2241.97] potatoes don't give me a sugar 
[2239.27 - 2244.07] spike. I was gobsmacked. I was 
[2242.04 - 2244.88] gobsmacked. So, I am now 
[2244.14 - 2246.94] changing my diet in that 
[2244.94 - 2248.48] direction. So, may be Filipa, 
[2247.01 - 2250.08] you may at some point want to 
[2248.55 - 2252.02] wear a continuous glucose 
[2250.15 - 2252.75] monitor to understand your 
[2252.08 - 2255.12] sugar fluctuations because you 
[2252.82 - 2256.72] will get cravings and I want 
[2255.19 - 2259.16] you to eat dark chocolate and I 
[2256.79 - 2260.79] want when you take ah when you 
[2259.22 - 2262.06] have a sugar craving, ah I, I, 
[2260.86 - 2265.76] I look at, oh, oh, Philip has 
[2262.13 - 2267.03] got magnesium deficiency. Oh, 
[2265.83 - 2268.73] she is got a little bit of pre 
[2267.10 - 2269.83] diabetic range. Let's work on 
[2268.80 - 2271.47] the dietary. So, this is what I 
[2269.90 - 2272.57] would do with the genetic 
[2271.53 - 2274.34] testing and the the blood 
[2272.64 - 2276.31] testing, your thyroid, you 
[2274.40 - 2279.74] know, do I look at the 
[2276.37 - 2283.05] hormones? I work with a with a 
[2279.81 - 2284.41] with a gynecologist. The moment 
[2283.11 - 2285.68] you start working with 
[2284.48 - 2287.55] hormones, there is a huge 
[2285.75 - 2289.75] debate out there because of the 
[2287.62 - 2291.05] fluctuation in perimenopause 
[2289.82 - 2291.82] and then maybe menopause they 
[2291.12 - 2294.02] disappear. Ah you you are not 
[2291.89 - 2295.73] going to get much inputs other 
[2294.09 - 2297.09] than the doctor trying to put 
[2295.79 - 2298.96] you on hormonal therapy which 
[2297.16 - 2300.43] is the call of the doctor. 
[2299.03 - 2302.00] However, I am asking the women 
[2300.50 - 2305.10] out there, would you not like 
[2302.07 - 2306.14] to try looking at putting the 
[2305.17 - 2307.54] nutritional deficiencies in 
[2306.20 - 2308.67] place which you've never which 
[2307.61 - 2311.01] you may have never done your 
[2308.74 - 2313.01] entire life. So, look at 
[2311.07 - 2315.48] focusing it from, can I put 
[2313.08 - 2316.68] healthier food in my body? And 
[2315.55 - 2319.12] whether you are in New York, 
[2316.75 - 2321.12] Sydney or in India or in 
[2319.18 - 2323.15] London, I do not care. Food has 
[2321.18 - 2325.09] changed in the last 30 years in 
[2323.22 - 2326.29] terms of its nutritive content 
[2325.16 - 2330.03] and its chemical contents. 
[2326.36 - 2331.93] Chemical form of of negative 
[2330.09 - 2333.23] pesticides and insecticides. Ah 
[2332.00 - 2335.47] nutritional content from the 
[2333.30 - 2337.30] calcium, sodium, potassium, 
[2335.53 - 2338.57] magnesium, vanadium, manganese, 
[2337.37 - 2339.67] whatever nutrients, 
[2338.64 - 2342.47] micronutrients that a woman 
[2339.74 - 2344.01] requires. So, if you have a 
[2342.54 - 2345.98] testing done that works 
[2344.07 - 2346.68] amazingly. Now, Phillipa if, 
[2346.04 - 2348.08] you had a lot of money from 
[2346.74 - 2349.01] your Pilates class, I would 
[2348.14 - 2351.45] say, hey, Kiripa, could you 
[2349.08 - 2354.02] kind of give me about three 
[2351.51 - 2355.45] hundred pounds and I will do a 
[2354.08 - 2356.52] poop analysis of your 
[2355.52 - 2359.86] microbiome. I will send it to a 
[2356.59 - 2361.46] DN who analyse all your 
[2359.92 - 2362.79] bacteria and will come to a 
[2361.53 - 2363.99] conclusion which foods you 
[2362.86 - 2365.00] should eat or should not eat 
[2364.06 - 2366.60] for the next two, three years 
[2365.06 - 2368.07] of your life. And in that we 
[2366.66 - 2370.80] start getting four to five KGs 
[2368.13 - 2373.00] weight loss. Right? So these 
[2370.87 - 2374.44] are scientific ways that women 
[2373.07 - 2375.81] could do it. A blood test that 
[2374.51 - 2377.47] generated against a microbiome 
[2375.87 - 2378.71] test. Ah what should you be 
[2377.54 - 2381.04] looking for for better 
[2378.78 - 2385.01] nutrition for the muscle? Flat 
[2381.11 - 2386.75] down. Plant based protein. 
[2385.08 - 2388.28] Okay. I I do know that in the 
[2386.82 - 2389.65] earlier years we went with 
[2388.35 - 2391.39] dairy which was whey and but 
[2389.72 - 2394.99] research is saying that ah 
[2391.45 - 2396.46] better plant based protein ah 
[2395.06 - 2397.73] vegetarians live longer, lesser 
[2396.53 - 2401.50] incidences of ovarian and 
[2397.79 - 2404.53] breast cancer. And ah for me 
[2401.57 - 2407.14] soy ah one of the iso flavons 
[2404.60 - 2408.44] ah soy isoflavon. So we give it 
[2407.20 - 2409.97] as a nutritional supplement. 
[2408.51 - 2411.34] There are in soy there are two 
[2410.04 - 2414.51] iso flavours if I remember 
[2411.41 - 2416.41] correctly. And they have an 
[2414.58 - 2418.55] ability to behave like 
[2416.48 - 2419.28] phytoestrogens. Hmm. Which help 
[2418.62 - 2421.45] women through menopause 
[2419.35 - 2422.95] There's. black cohosh. Ah 
[2421.52 - 2424.99] there's taking more vitamin D. 
[2423.02 - 2426.99] Filipa you may be amazed if you 
[2425.05 - 2429.79] do ah if you do blood testing 
[2427.06 - 2431.99] of people in in UK and this is 
[2429.86 - 2434.47] a big issue in the UK because 
[2432.06 - 2436.13] everyone works with the NHS. 
[2434.53 - 2437.53] So, you can't kind of go 
[2436.20 - 2439.00] forgive me if I'm wrong over 
[2437.60 - 2440.14] here but you can't just go and 
[2439.07 - 2440.77] ask for a blood test like in 
[2440.20 - 2442.84] India, I can walk to a place 
[2440.84 - 2444.14] and they analyse everything and 
[2442.91 - 2445.54] they just do it without a 
[2444.21 - 2447.11] doctor's prescription. And I 
[2445.61 - 2447.98] can pay for it and get it. So, 
[2447.18 - 2449.48] it's a little bit difficult. 
[2448.05 - 2450.55] So, all my UK based clients are 
[2449.55 - 2451.58] like, I've got to go and talk 
[2450.61 - 2453.58] to my doctor and he's going to 
[2451.65 - 2454.62] ask me, why do I need a niacin 
[2453.65 - 2456.62] blood test? There's nothing 
[2454.68 - 2458.39] wrong with me And so, I do 
[2456.69 - 2459.96] believe nutritive medicine, 
[2458.45 - 2463.99] medical nutritive medicine is 
[2460.02 - 2466.56] now making ah ah ah come back 
[2464.06 - 2467.90] and I would advise you to ask 
[2466.63 - 2469.93] your doctor to get that done 
[2467.96 - 2471.97] for you. And I would also ask 
[2470.00 - 2474.40] you to get the DHEA blood test. 
[2472.04 - 2476.91] Because in most women this is 
[2474.47 - 2478.57] low and they feel that adrenal 
[2476.97 - 2481.95] fatigue, low energy levels. 
[2478.64 - 2482.61] Final point from the diet. 
[2482.01 - 2485.08] Women tend to get this 
[2482.68 - 2486.75] emotional eating after 3 PM to 
[2485.15 - 2488.28] 5 PM. It's not got to do with 
[2486.82 - 2491.05] the current generation. It's 
[2488.35 - 2493.06] got to do with evolution. Women 
[2491.12 - 2495.16] been designed to work with the 
[2493.12 - 2497.16] sun. The biological clock with 
[2495.22 - 2498.66] the sun. So, you need to eat 
[2497.23 - 2501.73] the most amount of food from 
[2498.73 - 2503.10] sunrise to about midday. And 
[2501.80 - 2504.17] then your cravings come in the 
[2503.17 - 2505.60] evening because most women are 
[2504.23 - 2506.14] busy in today's world. They 
[2505.67 - 2507.97] have got jobs, they are 
[2506.20 - 2509.44] working. Breakfast is very 
[2508.04 - 2510.57] small. Lunch is almost 
[2509.51 - 2513.31] negligent. By three o'clock the 
[2510.64 - 2514.98] body is gotten into a a dip in 
[2513.38 - 2517.55] a drain. So, if somebody is 
[2515.05 - 2519.05] working out in the morning, I 
[2517.61 - 2521.12] advise there was a research 
[2519.12 - 2522.52] done at the University of 
[2521.18 - 2523.42] Sarif, I'm not mistaken. Men 
[2522.59 - 2527.02] should fast and train. Women 
[2523.49 - 2528.59] should eat and this is very 
[2527.09 - 2530.29] very important especially in 
[2528.66 - 2532.70] menopausal women. So, you got 
[2530.36 - 2535.10] to have may be about 10, 20 
[2532.76 - 2536.53] grams of protein, about an hour 
[2535.16 - 2537.90] prior to your training, 
[2536.60 - 2539.64] especially if it's resistance 
[2537.97 - 2541.27] training, Pilates Training If. 
[2539.70 - 2543.54] it's yoga, walking, maybe you 
[2541.34 - 2545.21] don't need that much. An egg 
[2543.61 - 2548.58] should suffice it six grams of 
[2545.28 - 2550.25] protein with a fruit. Post 
[2548.64 - 2552.52] workout filipa. Since you are 
[2550.31 - 2555.18] an instructor, I would give you 
[2552.58 - 2556.55] 15 to 20 grams of protein in 
[2555.25 - 2558.15] your normal dietary pattern. Do 
[2556.62 - 2559.86] you need a protein supplement? 
[2558.22 - 2560.42] Well, if you are working with 
[2559.92 - 2562.63] the nutritionist, I pride 
[2560.49 - 2563.56] myself work with my clients, we 
[2562.69 - 2564.83] can achieve it while I diet. 
[2563.63 - 2566.83] I'm like, oh no, baby. No, no, 
[2564.89 - 2567.96] no, but if I eat so much of 
[2566.90 - 2570.10] beans and if I eat so much of 
[2568.03 - 2571.53] things, my calories go up. I 
[2570.17 - 2573.94] have seen when women begin to 
[2571.60 - 2576.44] eat, they gain muscle and 
[2574.00 - 2579.04] listen in closely everyone. 
[2576.51 - 2581.21] Muscle stores, I think about 
[2579.11 - 2584.58] six times more water than fat 
[2581.28 - 2585.98] does. So, muscle is extremely 
[2584.65 - 2589.49] dense. So, fat might be this 
[2586.05 - 2591.82] big for one pound or one KG and 
[2589.55 - 2594.16] must might be just this much 
[2591.89 - 2595.49] for one KG. So, you're going to 
[2594.22 - 2597.43] get toned up and to build 
[2595.56 - 2600.46] muscle, you've got to give 
[2597.49 - 2602.57] protein. About 10 to 15 grams 
[2600.53 - 2604.77] after your workout within a one 
[2602.63 - 2606.24] hour window. If you don't do 
[2604.84 - 2607.70] this, your muscles going to be 
[2606.30 - 2609.94] saying, hey, this lady really 
[2607.77 - 2611.78] whacked me in this workout and 
[2610.01 - 2614.04] she was trying to build some 
[2611.84 - 2615.51] muscle but guess what? Muscle, 
[2614.11 - 2617.15] muscle was like, okay, I've got 
[2615.58 - 2618.32] all of this glucose in me. I'm 
[2617.21 - 2618.98] going to burn it off. Great, 
[2618.38 - 2621.15] that's a first 20 minutes. Ah 
[2619.05 - 2622.28] and then you you got your very 
[2621.22 - 2623.12] gunhorn your workout whether 
[2622.35 - 2624.02] it's morning or evening and 
[2623.19 - 2626.12] then after 20 minutes the 
[2624.09 - 2627.72] masjid like hey let's get some 
[2626.19 - 2628.76] fat into the act. Fat is 
[2627.79 - 2630.03] sitting down over there in the 
[2628.83 - 2631.70] on the couch reading a 
[2630.09 - 2634.30] newspaper having her cup of 
[2631.76 - 2635.67] teas like ah darling. I ain't 
[2634.36 - 2638.23] getting out for this lady at 
[2635.73 - 2639.67] all. Let's do one thing. Just 
[2638.30 - 2641.14] contact the muscle, ask the 
[2639.74 - 2644.14] muscle to commit suicide and 
[2641.20 - 2646.48] break down. So you get this? As 
[2644.21 - 2647.78] you start doing weight 
[2646.54 - 2649.41] training, your muscles going 
[2647.84 - 2651.82] down. Because your diet's 
[2649.48 - 2653.25] correct. So, I need you to get 
[2651.88 - 2654.65] that protein to get your muscle 
[2653.32 - 2657.02] up and it's the muscle that 
[2654.72 - 2658.86] takes that button. In India, we 
[2657.09 - 2660.02] call it a latte and it beats 
[2658.92 - 2661.32] the fat into submission. Now, 
[2660.09 - 2662.59] all women say, oh wow, this is 
[2661.39 - 2663.59] really good. I'm going to start 
[2662.66 - 2664.96] working out really well 
[2663.66 - 2667.80] tomorrow. But from a 
[2665.03 - 2670.53] perspective, you can lose about 
[2667.86 - 2673.17] 20 grams of fat in a day. Which 
[2670.60 - 2675.44] is about 600 grams per month. I 
[2673.24 - 2676.94] want three KGs of fat loss 
[2675.51 - 2677.84] mister Fernando I. am not 
[2677.01 - 2681.08] paying you the big bucks if I 
[2677.91 - 2683.05] don't get three KG fat loss. 
[2681.14 - 2684.38] It's metabolism, it's not 
[2683.11 - 2687.08] economics, it's as simple as 
[2684.45 - 2689.62] that. Ah Phillipa are, you 
[2687.15 - 2693.22] taking any supplements? Well, 
[2689.69 - 2696.06] Ryan, I supplement with vitamin 
[2693.29 - 2697.73] D in the Western Hemisphere. 
[2696.13 - 2700.03] It's recommended that we take 
[2697.79 - 2701.43] vitamin D every day 
[2700.10 - 2705.64] particularly between October 
[2701.50 - 2709.71] and April. Um and I supplement 
[2705.70 - 2711.44] with magnesium. and you know an 
[2709.77 - 2713.68] all round women's vitamin is 
[2711.51 - 2715.04] the. That's very good. That's 
[2713.74 - 2717.58] very good. So, I would advise 
[2715.11 - 2719.38] all women, get the blood test, 
[2717.65 - 2720.52] a a good multivitamins, good. 
[2719.45 - 2721.99] If you're scared about taking a 
[2720.58 - 2723.32] multivitamin, get your 
[2722.05 - 2725.56] physician's advice. When you're 
[2723.39 - 2727.22] looking to multivitamin, your B 
[2725.62 - 2728.52] complex vitamins are very 
[2727.29 - 2730.96] important. Filipa, you hit the 
[2728.59 - 2732.43] nail on the head. Um definitely 
[2731.03 - 2734.30] calcium and magnesium are 
[2732.50 - 2735.73] crucial. Uh one learning that I 
[2734.36 - 2738.17] have had from the gene test in 
[2735.80 - 2740.44] my clinic is that excessive 
[2738.24 - 2742.67] calcium can affect your 
[2740.50 - 2744.74] arterial stiffness. Uh blood 
[2742.74 - 2746.14] pressure from direction and 
[2744.81 - 2747.48] plaque formation. So, there are 
[2746.21 - 2749.95] certain individuals in the 
[2747.54 - 2750.68] planet who have a wholesome 
[2750.01 - 2752.41] calcium absorption which means 
[2750.75 - 2753.98] from your normal food, you get 
[2752.48 - 2756.39] enough. So, you want to be 
[2754.05 - 2758.26] taking a multivitamin minus 
[2756.45 - 2760.59] calcium. In India, we have 70% 
[2758.32 - 2762.69] of the women who are anemic or 
[2760.66 - 2765.06] iron deficient. Wow. So, we 
[2762.76 - 2766.13] want to be taking an iron 
[2765.13 - 2767.06] supplementation. You want to be 
[2766.20 - 2769.13] taking something that's kind in 
[2767.13 - 2771.50] the gut. So, the the, the, the, 
[2769.20 - 2773.17] the modest operandi when, when, 
[2771.57 - 2774.14] you know, if you walked into my 
[2773.24 - 2775.57] clinic, he says, should I take 
[2774.20 - 2776.91] some more supplements? My 
[2775.64 - 2778.47] neighbours taking this, my 
[2776.97 - 2783.55] colleagues taking that. I would 
[2778.54 - 2785.48] say to you the prescription of 
[2783.61 - 2787.52] a nutritional supplement is 
[2785.55 - 2789.02] borderline between your 
[2787.58 - 2790.72] nutritional discipline and your 
[2789.09 - 2793.49] nutritional indiscipline. If 
[2790.79 - 2796.09] you are disciplined and you eat 
[2793.56 - 2798.63] the balanced diet under the 
[2796.16 - 2799.60] guidance of a nutrition because 
[2798.70 - 2801.20] let's take, let's face it, 
[2799.66 - 2803.43] okay? Nobody has ever been 
[2801.26 - 2804.57] taught to eat out of science. 
[2803.50 - 2806.40] We have all learnt to eat out 
[2804.64 - 2807.67] of love and culture. Our 
[2806.47 - 2809.57] parents have taught us at the 
[2807.74 - 2811.51] dining table. Ah you know my 
[2809.64 - 2812.94] mom start ah put food on the 
[2811.57 - 2813.94] table, made me like my food. 
[2813.01 - 2815.98] And then as I have gone through 
[2814.01 - 2816.61] life, you know you watch what 
[2816.05 - 2818.78] your wife makes for you. She 
[2816.68 - 2820.08] wants ah what to put on the 
[2818.85 - 2821.22] table. So, it's very love and 
[2820.15 - 2823.42] culture based. It's not 
[2821.28 - 2825.09] scientific. And I think a women 
[2823.49 - 2826.96] kind of designs her entire meal 
[2825.16 - 2829.36] plan around her family rather 
[2827.02 - 2830.46] than her own body. So, I think 
[2829.43 - 2831.73] when we miss out on those 
[2830.53 - 2834.56] snippets, a supplement really 
[2831.80 - 2837.67] helps. I'm huge on Siberian 
[2834.63 - 2839.50] ginseng. Um I've seen it works 
[2837.73 - 2842.67] with with women in menopause. 
[2839.57 - 2843.94] I'm. huge on bioflavonoids and 
[2842.74 - 2845.54] for every women that comes in, 
[2844.01 - 2849.11] I prescribe collagen outright 
[2845.61 - 2850.51] collagen. It's like grant, why, 
[2849.18 - 2852.32] why collagen? So, I was like, 
[2850.58 - 2853.78] okay, when I read the research 
[2852.38 - 2855.09] paper on collagen, it could be 
[2853.85 - 2857.29] bovine collagen, it could be 
[2855.15 - 2858.45] marine collagen. Now, they are 
[2857.35 - 2860.96] making variants of plant 
[2858.52 - 2861.62] collagen but it's got the amino 
[2861.02 - 2863.13] acids, it's not the real 
[2861.69 - 2864.96] collagen. But it should be good 
[2863.19 - 2865.76] enough if you are vegan or 
[2865.03 - 2867.30] vegetarian. Now, here's the 
[2865.83 - 2869.53] story. When I read the research 
[2867.36 - 2872.17] paper on collagen, they found 
[2869.60 - 2875.34] out that fine line wrinkles 
[2872.24 - 2877.97] improve in six weeks. 
[2875.41 - 2880.94] elasticity of skin bumped up by 
[2878.04 - 2882.61] 22% in six weeks. And reduction 
[2881.01 - 2885.08] in hyperpigmentation and dark 
[2882.68 - 2886.68] spots drastically dropped by 
[2885.15 - 2890.19] under five to 6%. So I am 
[2886.75 - 2892.55] thinking lady you going to want 
[2890.25 - 2894.09] to love my program. So I can't 
[2892.62 - 2895.62] prescribe makeup to you to look 
[2894.16 - 2898.23] to make your skin glow. But if 
[2895.69 - 2899.90] I write collagen at 10 grams a 
[2898.30 - 2901.20] day in six weeks you going to 
[2899.96 - 2902.70] come back very happy and you 
[2901.26 - 2903.70] going to be like Ryan I want to 
[2902.76 - 2905.43] follow more of the diet. So 
[2903.77 - 2906.50] this is a secret tip that I 
[2905.50 - 2907.57] would give all women. You could 
[2906.57 - 2910.14] make your bone broth soup. 
[2907.64 - 2911.61] Which will release collagen 
[2910.21 - 2913.08] into it. So, it's called bone 
[2911.68 - 2914.01] broth or collagen soup. You can 
[2913.14 - 2915.61] Google this up on the internet. 
[2914.08 - 2917.95] Or you could buy a ready made 
[2915.68 - 2919.35] collagen either marine or 
[2918.01 - 2920.88] bovine. Be careful. Some of you 
[2919.42 - 2922.18] are allergic to fish. So you 
[2920.95 - 2923.79] get collagen based from fish 
[2922.25 - 2925.42] source. And and to give you 
[2923.85 - 2927.66] food for thought if you look at 
[2925.49 - 2930.03] the Japanese, the Koreans. They 
[2927.72 - 2931.46] do a lot of stews. Which are 
[2930.09 - 2933.36] marine based and seaweed based. 
[2931.53 - 2936.63] And if you look at their skin, 
[2933.43 - 2937.57] it's very porcelain like. So, 
[2936.70 - 2940.27] you want to take a little bit 
[2937.63 - 2942.51] of input or just just Google up 
[2940.34 - 2944.61] Can menopausal women take 
[2942.57 - 2946.94] collagen? What does collagen do 
[2944.68 - 2948.64] to my body? Is collagen safe to 
[2947.01 - 2949.45] take? What is the dose of 
[2948.71 - 2950.61] collagen? Because collagen is a 
[2949.51 - 2952.75] protein. So, if this is one 
[2950.68 - 2954.08] gift that you could give to all 
[2952.82 - 2957.09] our listeners today, it would 
[2954.15 - 2959.66] be supplement with about five 
[2957.15 - 2960.99] to 10 grams of collagen. Ah 
[2959.72 - 2963.46] best time to take it after 
[2961.06 - 2965.53] Filipa's workout. Yo, Daniel 
[2963.53 - 2967.06] Pilates do, we need a reformer 
[2965.59 - 2970.03] bed to do Pilates? Uh no, Ryan, 
[2967.13 - 2971.00] but I just interject something. 
[2970.10 - 2972.10] Yes, please, please, please 
[2971.07 - 2973.57] interrupt me. This is your show 
[2972.17 - 2974.64] and my show. Let's, let's just 
[2973.64 - 2975.51] go and banter because we 
[2974.70 - 2976.97] want to give as much 
[2975.57 - 2978.47] information out there. You 
[2977.04 - 2980.01] know, I mean, collagen 
[2978.54 - 2981.91] synthesis, it's not just in the 
[2980.08 - 2983.95] skin, is it collagen? It's, 
[2981.98 - 2987.45] it's in every tissue. Uh, and 
[2984.01 - 2990.02] so, muscle, ligament, 
[2987.52 - 2990.85] cartilage, and you were kind of 
[2990.09 - 2993.06] mentioning earlier about, is 
[2990.92 - 2994.26] this why our hips start to 
[2993.12 - 2995.79] ache? Balancing on one leg 
[2994.32 - 2997.36] isn't necessarily going to make 
[2995.86 - 3000.00] your hips start to ache. But, 
[2997.43 - 3001.50] the collagen synthesis is 
[3000.06 - 3004.03] affected by the shifting 
[3001.57 - 3006.47] hormones of menopause. Uh and 
[3004.10 - 3009.11] not just in the skin. So you 
[3006.54 - 3010.77] know you are potentially more 
[3009.17 - 3012.94] prone to a ligament injury 
[3010.84 - 3013.71] because of this. To attend an 
[3013.01 - 3015.95] injury. There's definitely 
[3013.78 - 3018.55] research around that. And 
[3016.01 - 3020.15] that's actually the the 
[3018.61 - 3023.52] cartilage and the that's covers 
[3020.22 - 3025.76] our bones in joints such as the 
[3023.59 - 3029.46] knee and the hip. Can be 
[3025.82 - 3031.09] affected due to this shifting 
[3029.53 - 3033.60] collagen synthesis. And and so 
[3031.16 - 3035.03] the quality of the cartilage is 
[3033.66 - 3037.10] affected. It's compromised. And 
[3035.10 - 3039.14] that can lead to degenerative 
[3037.17 - 3041.04] joints Changes and so joint 
[3039.20 - 3044.14] aches and pains and such like. 
[3041.10 - 3045.88] So so I think the the far 
[3044.21 - 3047.34] reaching consequences of 
[3045.94 - 3049.21] collagen we should consider as 
[3047.41 - 3050.68] well. It it isn't just in the 
[3049.28 - 3052.22] skin is it? Absolutely 
[3050.75 - 3054.82] Absolutely. Ah you know ah 
[3052.28 - 3055.68] Phillipa if ah I work with some 
[3054.88 - 3058.65] of the most elite athletes in 
[3055.75 - 3060.09] the world and ah you know when 
[3058.72 - 3061.72] I tell them it's going to work 
[3060.16 - 3062.86] on your joints and ligaments. 
[3061.79 - 3064.69] People are not able to 
[3062.93 - 3066.60] visualise that whoa this is 
[3064.76 - 3068.13] going to be the lubrication 
[3066.66 - 3069.70] between my knee and my ACL and 
[3068.20 - 3072.14] stuff like that. And it's a 
[3069.77 - 3073.80] building block protein matrix 
[3072.20 - 3075.24] and all. So I was like you know 
[3073.87 - 3077.61] what let's just go with skin 
[3075.30 - 3079.24] because what's still hooked on 
[3077.67 - 3080.64] skin. Inside I'm repairing 
[3079.31 - 3081.78] everything and they going to be 
[3080.71 - 3082.98] like I feel like a million 
[3081.84 - 3084.18] bucks and you know then she is 
[3083.05 - 3085.01] like a ballerina at that point 
[3084.25 - 3087.35] and stuff like that. But I I 
[3085.08 - 3089.39] think in today's discussion if 
[3087.42 - 3091.02] there is something that we can 
[3089.45 - 3092.59] safely allow people to take. 
[3091.09 - 3094.06] Provided they don't have a food 
[3092.66 - 3095.02] allergy to the source of the 
[3094.12 - 3097.43] food source of collagen. I 
[3095.09 - 3100.16] think collagen would be number 
[3097.49 - 3101.93] number one on my list. But in 
[3100.23 - 3104.57] India you know ah Filipa I have 
[3102.00 - 3105.70] a collagen. Ah I I've made a 
[3104.63 - 3108.00] collagen and I actually sell it 
[3105.77 - 3108.87] on on a website called 
[3108.07 - 3110.24] supplement.in. Ah because my 
[3108.94 - 3111.91] wife Wendy pulled my leg and 
[3110.31 - 3112.94] she's she was having collagen 
[3111.97 - 3113.94] from different brands and she 
[3113.01 - 3116.68] said to me. They taste really 
[3114.01 - 3118.38] bad in your a big shot 
[3116.75 - 3119.68] nutritionist and you, you, you 
[3118.45 - 3120.75] talk about all of this, why 
[3119.75 - 3122.15] can't you design a nice tasting 
[3120.82 - 3123.75] collagen? So, I spent one year. 
[3122.22 - 3125.89] Did a beautiful tasting 
[3123.82 - 3127.12] collagen. Ah but there is an 
[3125.96 - 3129.53] unfortunate problem in our part 
[3127.19 - 3131.06] of the world. Majority of our 
[3129.59 - 3132.93] population is vegetarian. Oh, 
[3131.13 - 3134.16] yes. So, I want to give one tip 
[3133.00 - 3135.40] to the vegetarian population, 
[3134.23 - 3137.57] for those of you who are 
[3135.47 - 3141.47] checking in from India or 
[3137.63 - 3143.04] vegetarian or vegan. Proline, 
[3141.54 - 3146.04] hydroxyproline and lycine are 
[3143.11 - 3148.48] three important amino acids in 
[3146.11 - 3149.78] cartilage synthesis. So, if you 
[3148.54 - 3152.41] can find the foods that are 
[3149.84 - 3154.08] high in protein, hydrox proline 
[3152.48 - 3157.39] Ah metunine also I forgot 
[3154.15 - 3159.26] metunin and lycine. You could 
[3157.45 - 3160.49] command your body to make its 
[3159.32 - 3161.93] own collagen. By the way ah 
[3160.56 - 3163.26] Phillipa just for for the 
[3161.99 - 3164.56] scientist out there who is 
[3163.33 - 3166.09] going through menopause You. 
[3164.63 - 3167.76] are absolutely right. We don't 
[3166.16 - 3169.76] absorb protein into our blood. 
[3167.83 - 3171.60] We take the collagen. We break 
[3169.83 - 3173.57] it down. So collagen is like a 
[3171.67 - 3174.30] car dealer and has that pack of 
[3173.64 - 3175.50] cards. And says okay I'm 
[3174.37 - 3176.64] going to give you all these 
[3175.57 - 3178.01] amino acids in your blood. And 
[3176.71 - 3179.11] then your blood takes to the 
[3178.07 - 3179.74] liver and the liver sends 
[3179.18 - 3182.91] different amino acids packaged 
[3179.81 - 3184.95] it. And then Phillipa's knee is 
[3182.98 - 3187.15] just done like ah I don't know 
[3185.01 - 3187.82] what pose whatever you call on 
[3187.22 - 3189.95] standing on one knee and that 
[3187.88 - 3191.42] knee is like okay we had a 30 
[3190.02 - 3192.99] minute class today on this knee 
[3191.49 - 3194.26] calling up the liver please 
[3193.06 - 3195.53] send in some I said yeah yeah 
[3194.32 - 3196.69] yeah we are sending some 
[3195.59 - 3197.36] glutamine is coming in branch 
[3196.76 - 3198.36] chain coming in I said oh 
[3197.43 - 3199.63] branch chain I mean I said 
[3198.43 - 3201.10] makes up 30% of a women's 
[3199.70 - 3202.36] muscle Phillipa you got to be 
[3201.16 - 3203.67] taking five grams of branch 
[3202.43 - 3205.30] chain I mean acids during a 
[3203.73 - 3206.34] workout oh Ryan how should I do 
[3205.37 - 3207.47] that ah well your liver is 
[3206.40 - 3208.77] going to ask for it during the 
[3207.54 - 3211.41] workout so just dunk in five 
[3208.84 - 3214.01] grams of BCA in your during the 
[3211.47 - 3215.91] workout. Ah by the way plain 
[3214.08 - 3217.35] BCA is extremely bitter. So you 
[3215.98 - 3219.71] might want to get a flavoured 
[3217.41 - 3221.12] version. But ah the other amino 
[3219.78 - 3222.18] acids, protein, hydroxy, 
[3221.18 - 3224.49] proline would come in from your 
[3222.25 - 3226.66] protein supplement. And for 
[3224.55 - 3228.99] women I would probably do a soy 
[3226.72 - 3230.56] protein or a tofu or a tempe. 
[3229.06 - 3232.23] At least twice or thrice a week 
[3230.63 - 3234.50] to kind of give you the soy as 
[3232.29 - 3238.03] your flavours. Filipi with 
[3234.56 - 3239.67] regards to exercise My brain is 
[3238.10 - 3241.87] totally bombarded at this 
[3239.74 - 3244.47] point. With all that 
[3241.94 - 3247.01] information. Ryan, you are a 
[3244.54 - 3248.64] absolute mind of information, 
[3247.08 - 3249.88] honestly. I'm going to, I'm 
[3248.71 - 3251.08] going to send this across to 
[3249.95 - 3252.38] you, Phillipa and I'm going to 
[3251.15 - 3253.78] put this on the video. So, 
[3252.45 - 3256.28] these are things that people 
[3253.85 - 3258.35] could do from a nutritional 
[3256.35 - 3260.22] point of view because Phillipa, 
[3258.42 - 3262.09] what I want the world to 
[3260.29 - 3264.46] realize is that we tend to turn 
[3262.16 - 3266.16] to medicine immediately to heal 
[3264.53 - 3268.76] us. Please understand one 
[3266.23 - 3272.07] thing, before the advent of 
[3268.83 - 3274.44] medicine, the human race died 
[3272.14 - 3278.41] or healed itself. who healed it 
[3274.50 - 3281.01] own body. And so the evolution 
[3278.47 - 3283.41] has made your body understand 
[3281.08 - 3286.08] the lack of nutrients and the 
[3283.48 - 3288.55] excessive nutrients. And the 
[3286.15 - 3290.09] wrong nutrients and the right 
[3288.62 - 3292.76] nutrients. I think if if every 
[3290.15 - 3294.32] women just sat down and made a 
[3292.82 - 3295.79] list and this is a simple 
[3294.39 - 3298.63] exercise Phillipa I wanted to 
[3295.86 - 3300.53] do before we finish of 2021. 
[3298.70 - 3303.97] Keep a small food diary. Write 
[3300.60 - 3305.97] down the foods you eat. Okay. 
[3304.03 - 3309.64] when you get up in the morning, 
[3306.03 - 3312.01] take a deep breath. both 
[3309.71 - 3313.68] nostrils. If they are clear, if 
[3312.07 - 3316.01] they are clear, whatever food 
[3313.74 - 3318.55] you ate 24 hours ago has not 
[3316.08 - 3320.08] created mucus. Wow. And your 
[3318.61 - 3321.42] sinus are not locked. Kick mark 
[3320.15 - 3322.95] all those foods you love. Now, 
[3321.48 - 3325.45] I'll share with you how I 
[3323.02 - 3328.76] discover it. I am allergic to 
[3325.52 - 3330.73] chocolate. Okay. Part of. I I 
[3328.82 - 3332.06] did the food, food intolerance 
[3330.79 - 3333.56] test, this chocolate, this 
[3332.13 - 3336.16] peanut, there's there's milk 
[3333.63 - 3336.77] and there's wheat for me. So, 
[3336.23 - 3337.90] if I eat any one of these 
[3336.83 - 3340.47] foods, when I get up in the 
[3337.97 - 3342.04] morning, it's completely clock 
[3340.54 - 3342.87] My wife has nudged me five 
[3342.11 - 3345.57] times a night that I have 
[3342.94 - 3347.54] snored. Right? So, I want 
[3345.64 - 3349.51] people to be Sherlock homes of 
[3347.61 - 3351.68] their own body. Keep the food 
[3349.58 - 3353.62] diary, right? Then we have a 
[3351.75 - 3354.32] bowel evacuation, we go to 
[3353.68 - 3357.55] potty, all of us potty on the 
[3354.38 - 3358.89] planet. I always tell women, 
[3357.62 - 3362.16] check out if you had a great 
[3358.95 - 3363.19] party, a okay party, or a down 
[3362.22 - 3364.56] party. Now, don't ask me to 
[3363.26 - 3366.06] describe that to you but it's 
[3364.63 - 3367.66] much like your spouse. Some 
[3366.13 - 3370.03] days your spouse is very good, 
[3367.73 - 3371.10] some days your spouse is 
[3370.10 - 3371.77] intermediate and some days you 
[3371.17 - 3374.04] just want to disown your 
[3371.83 - 3377.51] spouse. It's same with your 
[3374.10 - 3377.51] poop at the end of the day. 
[3378.47 - 3381.11] Well, you know, that's as 
[3379.94 - 3383.48] fascinating actually and and 
[3381.18 - 3384.91] that is something that does 
[3383.55 - 3387.52] bother us more during this 
[3384.98 - 3389.15] menopause time, digestive 
[3387.58 - 3391.92] challenges and and the body, 
[3389.22 - 3393.52] the inputs and the outputs and 
[3391.99 - 3395.42] your body is dealing with 
[3393.59 - 3397.13] things that it used to quite 
[3395.49 - 3398.69] happily contend with and then 
[3397.19 - 3400.86] all of a sudden, it's it's 
[3398.76 - 3402.00] really not working. It's it's 
[3400.93 - 3404.90] whatever you're doing is not 
[3402.06 - 3406.00] working anymore. So, so, you 
[3404.97 - 3409.61] know, I I like the nostril idea 
[3406.07 - 3412.14] and I and definitely you know, 
[3409.67 - 3413.18] some people struggle with sinus 
[3412.21 - 3415.01] trouble the whole time and 
[3413.24 - 3417.35] maybe it could be as simple as 
[3415.08 - 3418.45] food. Uh I'd I'd love to think 
[3417.41 - 3421.12] that because you know. It is 
[3418.51 - 3422.88] only food. It is only food. I'm 
[3421.18 - 3425.66] totally on that page with you 
[3422.95 - 3429.06] but movement is medicine and 
[3425.72 - 3430.93] food is medicine and if only we 
[3429.12 - 3432.96] could you know, return to some 
[3430.99 - 3435.16] of these traditional values, 
[3433.03 - 3439.27] herbs, herbs and you know, 
[3435.23 - 3442.47] things up from the roots in the 
[3439.34 - 3444.67] garden Uh I mean I I absolutely 
[3442.54 - 3447.21] absolutely concur that if we if 
[3444.74 - 3448.28] we can listen in and tune in is 
[3447.28 - 3450.75] the other thing with our 
[3448.34 - 3452.41] bodies. But you know we're so 
[3450.81 - 3455.22] busy going about our lives 
[3452.48 - 3456.45] mindlessly. Not really 
[3455.28 - 3458.42] connecting with how we feel in 
[3456.52 - 3460.39] our mind. How we feel in our 
[3458.49 - 3463.06] bodies. How we feel in our gut. 
[3460.46 - 3464.39] And and if we can make those 
[3463.13 - 3468.56] connections deeply. Then we can 
[3464.46 - 3471.07] really start to notice whether 
[3468.63 - 3473.77] or not that the food is 
[3471.13 - 3475.07] affecting us. Um and so I I do 
[3473.84 - 3478.11] I'm definitely going to keep 
[3475.14 - 3480.14] the diary Because you know 
[3478.17 - 3481.91] because the other thing is that 
[3480.21 - 3483.98] we kind of are very good at 
[3481.98 - 3485.82] cheating ourselves and 
[3484.05 - 3488.12] persuading ourselves that the 
[3485.88 - 3489.65] the it's not what I'm eating or 
[3488.18 - 3490.42] it's not what I'm doing. I'm 
[3489.72 - 3492.29] you know but then when you 
[3490.49 - 3495.16] actually commit the pen to the 
[3492.36 - 3496.59] paper the truth kind of you 
[3495.22 - 3499.33] you've stirring the truth in 
[3496.66 - 3501.46] the face. And and that really 
[3499.39 - 3505.03] powerful actually. You know and 
[3501.53 - 3507.44] and and so food is fuel. Food 
[3505.10 - 3509.31] is nourishment but you know is 
[3507.50 - 3510.67] there a role for intermittent 
[3509.37 - 3512.64] fasting? This is something that 
[3510.74 - 3514.14] we do in such a lot about 
[3512.71 - 3516.55] aren't we? It's very topical at 
[3514.21 - 3518.41] the moment. Yeah so from a 
[3516.61 - 3521.98] menopause point of view so I 
[3518.48 - 3523.99] had the privilege of having a 
[3522.05 - 3526.42] very gifted team with me. Uh we 
[3524.05 - 3528.22] have about 54 dietitians on my 
[3526.49 - 3529.93] team here in India and we work 
[3528.29 - 3532.06] globally. Uh they are always 
[3529.99 - 3533.46] women are all women in my team. 
[3532.13 - 3536.53] They are just two boys in the 
[3533.53 - 3537.93] team. Ah and and ah for me 
[3536.60 - 3540.27] understanding the the female 
[3538.00 - 3543.27] hormonal cycle it's at work 
[3540.34 - 3544.51] everyday. But intermittent 
[3543.34 - 3546.04] fasting is a discussion that we 
[3544.57 - 3548.41] have had on the team. And 
[3546.11 - 3550.28] especially for the menopausal 
[3548.48 - 3552.05] ah patients or women have gone 
[3550.35 - 3556.09] through menopause Let. me break 
[3552.11 - 3558.92] it down. Evolution did not have 
[3556.15 - 3560.79] fridges. In the past. Evolution 
[3558.99 - 3563.99] in the past did not have seize 
[3560.86 - 3565.99] all round food, we add seasonal 
[3564.06 - 3568.50] fruits. Evolution in the past 
[3566.06 - 3569.86] grew crops where you had 
[3568.56 - 3572.13] abundance at one season of the 
[3569.93 - 3573.74] year, spring and summer. And 
[3572.20 - 3576.77] then autumn it tapered off and 
[3573.80 - 3578.37] winter was fasted. So, I do 
[3576.84 - 3581.51] believe that if we take the 
[3578.44 - 3583.41] last 00 years, man has evolved 
[3581.58 - 3584.98] faster than it's ever evolved. 
[3583.48 - 3585.98] Yeah. But our genetics have not 
[3585.05 - 3588.05] changed this much, which is why 
[3586.05 - 3590.09] hypertension, diabetes, you 
[3588.12 - 3591.35] have menopausal women much 
[3590.15 - 3593.92] larger today as compared to 
[3591.42 - 3596.46] their grannies. Or great granny 
[3593.99 - 3597.93] So, intermittent fasting from 
[3596.53 - 3600.43] my book after researching is a 
[3597.99 - 3602.33] thumbs up. But it has to be 
[3600.50 - 3603.53] done from a women's 
[3602.40 - 3606.87] perspective. I would advise 
[3603.60 - 3608.67] most women to not do the early 
[3606.94 - 3611.14] morning and late breakfast 
[3608.74 - 3612.64] because I have analysed it from 
[3611.21 - 3614.88] an emotional point of view, a 
[3612.71 - 3615.64] household point of view, a food 
[3614.94 - 3617.98] availability point of view and 
[3615.71 - 3620.58] a women's psychology point of 
[3618.05 - 3623.55] view. You should feed through 
[3620.65 - 3626.02] the day, eat dinner early as 
[3623.62 - 3627.69] possible, as early as possible. 
[3626.09 - 3629.06] Because then you can get up in 
[3627.76 - 3630.29] the morning and start your 
[3629.12 - 3632.43] Pilates you, can start your 
[3630.36 - 3634.16] yoga, you can be in a fed state 
[3632.49 - 3636.63] and once you are fed as a women 
[3634.23 - 3638.50] in menopause, you, feel 
[3636.70 - 3639.80] invincible and because you feel 
[3638.57 - 3641.44] invincible, you plow through 
[3639.87 - 3642.94] the day and then because you 
[3641.50 - 3644.57] are getting older, by the time 
[3643.01 - 3646.14] three o'clock comes down, you 
[3644.64 - 3647.38] begin to relax, you have your 
[3646.21 - 3649.21] cup of tea. In today's world 
[3647.44 - 3650.38] because of electricity and the 
[3649.28 - 3654.05] internet and we work in 
[3650.45 - 3654.78] different time zones women are 
[3654.12 - 3657.25] forced to work on those high 
[3654.85 - 3658.52] energy levels between three and 
[3657.32 - 3660.16] ten o'clock at night. And I 
[3658.59 - 3662.93] think that's not working for 
[3660.22 - 3664.03] her her hormones at that point 
[3662.99 - 3666.23] once she is gone through 
[3664.09 - 3667.16] menopause So. ah we need to 
[3666.30 - 3668.16] tone down the lights. We need 
[3667.23 - 3670.23] to work harder in the first 
[3668.23 - 3672.34] part of the day. Eat in the 
[3670.30 - 3674.27] first part of the day. And I do 
[3672.40 - 3676.27] believe that whoever's done 
[3674.34 - 3680.28] this has been able to ah have 
[3676.34 - 3683.55] better fat loss. And for me 
[3680.34 - 3684.25] I've if I, if, if I have, if I, 
[3683.61 - 3687.55] if Filipa, if you came to me 
[3684.31 - 3688.32] and I put a scale of 00, I 
[3687.62 - 3690.65] would immediately in my mind 
[3688.38 - 3692.12] put 60% to fat. Because the 
[3690.72 - 3693.52] moment a woman comes to me for 
[3692.19 - 3695.52] a diet plan, she doesn't 
[3693.59 - 3697.59] understand the medical, the 
[3695.59 - 3700.13] technical, the hormonal, the 
[3697.66 - 3701.90] exercise, the verbs. She just 
[3700.20 - 3702.87] understands my body doesn't 
[3701.96 - 3704.50] look how it looked 20 years 
[3702.93 - 3706.74] ago. Can you get rid of this 
[3704.57 - 3709.14] fat? But for me that 60% is 
[3706.80 - 3710.87] psychological intimate in 
[3709.20 - 3713.61] fasting, really helps in 
[3710.94 - 3715.11] targeting that fat burning. 
[3713.68 - 3717.61] Provided she is aware of a 
[3715.18 - 3720.15] muscle. She is done a muscle 
[3717.68 - 3723.28] check and she knows she has 
[3720.22 - 3725.25] 22KGs or 16 KGs or 12 KGs or 
[3723.35 - 3727.12] 55KG whatever her weight is of 
[3725.32 - 3729.29] of muscle and how much of fat 
[3727.19 - 3730.49] and she takes that muscle and 
[3729.36 - 3733.03] chisels away the fat and again 
[3730.56 - 3733.80] Phillipa I tell people 
[3733.09 - 3735.40] intermittent fasting and 
[3733.86 - 3737.83] exercise if done scientifically 
[3735.46 - 3739.13] and correctly. Not how Berta is 
[3737.90 - 3741.54] doing it my neighbours cross 
[3739.20 - 3743.01] fit trainer. Oh my neighbours 
[3741.60 - 3744.41] Pilates trainer. I am just 
[3743.07 - 3745.64] going to start Pilates and I'm 
[3744.47 - 3747.84] not going to plan my diet. I'm 
[3745.71 - 3749.41] not going to plan my exercise. 
[3747.91 - 3751.18] I think the haphazard approach 
[3749.48 - 3753.52] would give you haphazard 
[3751.25 - 3754.85] results. And so one in 10 women 
[3753.58 - 3756.85] would get hit the nail on head 
[3754.92 - 3758.59] and she would like whoa I got 
[3756.92 - 3760.05] this and then suddenly all her 
[3758.65 - 3762.79] neighbours are falling her diet 
[3760.12 - 3764.23] plan which is more of look than 
[3762.86 - 3765.93] ah you know scientific 
[3764.29 - 3768.46] deduction. Ah intermittent 
[3765.99 - 3771.43] fasting can be seriously deep 
[3768.53 - 3772.47] dived by wearing a glucose 
[3771.50 - 3773.80] monitor, get one of those 
[3772.53 - 3776.14] patches on, work with a 
[3773.87 - 3778.11] qualified dietitian or a 
[3776.20 - 3779.14] nutritionist. And be truthful 
[3778.17 - 3782.21] to yourself with your food 
[3779.21 - 3785.75] diary. So ah ah I am not a 
[3782.28 - 3788.18] woman but ah ah I I eat jam 
[3785.82 - 3788.89] biscuits. On fun days. On 
[3788.25 - 3790.42] Sundays. I have jam biscuits. I 
[3788.95 - 3791.62] have gluten free jam biscuits. 
[3790.49 - 3792.69] Why do you have gluten free jam 
[3791.69 - 3794.79] biscuits? Because I did my DNA 
[3792.76 - 3796.59] test. Sunday evening I am my 
[3794.86 - 3797.36] cuppa. I have my five jam 
[3796.66 - 3799.13] biscuits. But when I was 
[3797.43 - 3800.60] wearing the CGM monitor I saw a 
[3799.20 - 3803.83] 4 o'clock sugar spike. Massive 
[3800.66 - 3803.83] sugar spike 
[3804.00 - 3806.07] So, in a day when the other 
[3804.83 - 3808.30] days I was not having ah ah ah 
[3806.13 - 3811.41] a biscuit. So I was in denial 
[3808.37 - 3813.38] that I psychologically needed 
[3811.47 - 3815.24] to have these biscuits. Because 
[3813.44 - 3816.51] it's a childhood thing that jam 
[3815.31 - 3818.11] biscuits and you know I'm 
[3816.58 - 3821.48] Sunday de-stress. So, with the 
[3818.18 - 3822.95] same psychology which is 
[3821.55 - 3825.35] genderless, right? We all 
[3823.02 - 3827.92] cheat, we all lose food as a, 
[3825.42 - 3829.59] as a comfort perspective. Ah, I 
[3827.99 - 3830.56] would advise people to keep a 
[3829.66 - 3833.76] food diary, keep a monitoring 
[3830.63 - 3834.93] device if you can afford it, if 
[3833.83 - 3836.66] you can't, just keep a food 
[3835.00 - 3839.10] diary. Watch your weight, watch 
[3836.73 - 3840.67] your fat percentage and every 
[3839.17 - 3842.54] six months do a blood test for 
[3840.74 - 3843.50] the nutritional deficiencies of 
[3842.61 - 3844.54] the vitamins and minerals. 
[3843.57 - 3846.04] People are not doing that. 
[3844.61 - 3848.51] Doctors are looking at liver, 
[3846.11 - 3850.91] kidney, cholesterol profile, 
[3848.58 - 3853.65] your hemogram, how your 
[3850.98 - 3854.98] ezonophyls, how's your ESR? Not 
[3853.72 - 3857.89] asking for a vitamin and 
[3855.05 - 3859.52] mineral test because medicine 
[3857.95 - 3860.72] at this point doesn't say that 
[3859.59 - 3862.29] nutritional deficiency is the 
[3860.79 - 3864.49] cause of your disease but it is 
[3862.36 - 3868.20] the reason of most of our 
[3864.56 - 3871.10] issues in life. Yeah, I mean, 
[3868.26 - 3873.47] isn't that the truth? It the 
[3871.17 - 3876.04] system is kind of set up to 
[3873.54 - 3878.77] perpetuate the medical model 
[3876.11 - 3880.04] and and undoubtedly, you know, 
[3878.84 - 3883.05] there's the role for that but 
[3880.11 - 3885.38] but food as fuel, food as 
[3883.11 - 3888.02] nourishment, food as medicine, 
[3885.45 - 3889.75] it's definitely on my agenda 
[3888.08 - 3892.09] and and you know, you you kind 
[3889.82 - 3894.29] of mentioned then about the the 
[3892.15 - 3897.46] sugar spike doesn't just come 
[3894.36 - 3898.96] with the sugar spice but it has 
[3897.53 - 3900.66] accompanying emotions 
[3899.03 - 3904.10] associated with it and then the 
[3900.73 - 3905.73] subsequent dropped down and 
[3904.17 - 3907.07] cravings and so, you know, we 
[3905.80 - 3908.77] kind of think we're being kind 
[3907.14 - 3910.94] to ourselves by giving 
[3908.84 - 3913.51] ourselves a treat in inverted 
[3911.01 - 3916.01] commerce and and that actually 
[3913.58 - 3918.45] we're just totally undermining 
[3916.08 - 3920.72] the what what would be the 
[3918.51 - 3922.95] status quo of feeling fantastic 
[3920.78 - 3924.42] all the time. You know, and so 
[3923.02 - 3927.22] as soon as we start to do this, 
[3924.49 - 3930.03] that's when, you know, it's 
[3927.29 - 3932.36] really a challenge to to feel 
[3930.09 - 3933.93] fantastic all the time and 
[3932.43 - 3936.57] let's you know I really want 
[3934.00 - 3939.04] women to feel fantastic all the 
[3936.63 - 3941.50] time. And so with movement and 
[3939.10 - 3942.91] food I really you know I said 
[3941.57 - 3944.67] that. It's a match made in 
[3942.97 - 3947.14] heaven. Right? But you know 
[3944.74 - 3949.38] quite rightly the scientific 
[3947.21 - 3952.11] approach is a a demonstrating 
[3949.45 - 3953.75] that we are unique. We are 
[3952.18 - 3957.59] totally individual. And 
[3953.82 - 3957.59] although there are 
[3958.05 - 3961.99] generalities that we can apply 
[3959.32 - 3963.29] in our lives. Um and you know 
[3962.06 - 3964.59] and definitely we've talked 
[3963.36 - 3967.20] about quite a lot of those when 
[3964.66 - 3968.83] it comes to Pilates. How much 
[3967.26 - 3971.67] should we do in a week? How 
[3968.90 - 3973.47] much should we do in a day? Uh 
[3971.73 - 3975.30] you know and these are general 
[3973.54 - 3977.54] guidelines. But we do want 
[3975.37 - 3979.61] people to start to do more 
[3977.61 - 3981.41] rather than less. And so we've 
[3979.68 - 3983.41] got to make it manageable for 
[3981.48 - 3985.75] people to to you know because 
[3983.48 - 3987.15] if we said you should exercise 
[3985.82 - 3988.65] seven days a week for an hour 
[3987.22 - 3990.42] then they might just not do 
[3988.72 - 3992.89] anything at all. So we've got 
[3990.49 - 3994.66] make it manageable for people 
[3992.95 - 3997.19] but equally there is that. I as 
[3994.72 - 3998.79] a physiotherapist tailor the 
[3997.26 - 4001.30] work that I do to the 
[3998.86 - 4003.50] individual needs of my clients' 
[4001.36 - 4005.10] bodies and for the most part 
[4003.57 - 4007.44] you can't get to being in your 
[4005.17 - 4010.17] 50s and in your 60s without 
[4007.50 - 4015.74] experiencing some kind of aches 
[4010.24 - 4018.15] and pains or body issues you 
[4015.81 - 4020.82] know. So Phillipa I'm just 
[4018.21 - 4021.85] thinking when when when women 
[4020.88 - 4025.49] come to our nutrition clinic. I 
[4021.92 - 4026.99] constantly tell the hire a 
[4025.55 - 4028.49] personal trainer, Hire a 
[4027.05 - 4031.03] personal Pilates instructor, 
[4028.56 - 4032.99] hire ah a personal yoga 
[4031.09 - 4035.20] trainer. And you just mention a 
[4033.06 - 4036.93] point you and you are you are 
[4035.26 - 4039.03] in your 50s and 60s and I see a 
[4037.00 - 4040.47] lot of people doing these high 
[4039.10 - 4041.80] intensity trainings or low 
[4040.54 - 4043.24] intensity trainings. So the 
[4041.87 - 4044.67] first thing my my question is 
[4043.30 - 4046.91] two parts because I want the 
[4044.74 - 4048.51] audience to to understand what 
[4046.98 - 4050.05] what tools they need to do is 
[4048.58 - 4051.45] when they go out to a gym or 
[4050.11 - 4054.25] find a trainer or find somebody 
[4051.51 - 4056.99] online is one Why is it 
[4054.32 - 4059.19] important to take personal 
[4057.05 - 4060.59] tailor made advice? Why is it 
[4059.25 - 4062.09] better than a group class? What 
[4060.66 - 4063.89] are the pros and the cons of 
[4062.16 - 4067.03] getting a personal guided 
[4063.96 - 4067.76] approach? And should I do high 
[4067.10 - 4069.10] intensity or low intensity 
[4067.83 - 4071.43] because I got these women who I 
[4069.16 - 4075.04] you know I'm in the gym ah and 
[4071.50 - 4076.04] I see these ladies and so I I 
[4075.10 - 4077.17] want to go up to them and say 
[4076.10 - 4078.97] aunty please don't run on the 
[4077.24 - 4079.84] treadmill please just walk. You 
[4079.04 - 4082.14] are like 60 years of age please 
[4079.91 - 4083.45] just walk. And they are like 
[4082.21 - 4084.95] you can make a they have never 
[4083.51 - 4085.91] gotten on a treadmill. So even 
[4085.01 - 4088.02] the way they are running is 
[4085.98 - 4089.32] like You can just see the knees 
[4088.08 - 4091.72] going in another week's time. 
[4089.38 - 4093.29] So, how important is personal 
[4091.79 - 4094.92] advice and high intensity or 
[4093.36 - 4096.93] low intensity? How would you 
[4094.99 - 4101.53] approach it for everyone 
[4096.99 - 4103.43] watching in today? everybody's 
[4101.60 - 4106.03] starting point is different. 
[4103.50 - 4108.44] And so it may be, like me, that 
[4106.10 - 4109.70] you've always done it regular 
[4108.50 - 4111.51] exercise throughout the whole 
[4109.77 - 4113.91] of your life, and you acquire a 
[4111.57 - 4116.51] level of experience and 
[4113.98 - 4119.35] expertise that is cumulative. 
[4116.58 - 4122.15] And, and so, you know, I have 
[4119.41 - 4123.65] friends who run marathons well 
[4122.22 - 4127.02] into their 60s and potentially 
[4123.72 - 4128.49] into the 70s. Now, I think 
[4127.09 - 4129.49] marathons are are slightly 
[4128.56 - 4131.19] draining for the body, and 
[4129.56 - 4133.36] maybe we're we're overdoing it 
[4131.26 - 4135.43] with a marathon, but make the 
[4133.43 - 4136.50] point. I agree with you. I 
[4135.50 - 4139.20] agree with you. I think 10 
[4136.56 - 4141.17] kilometres is enough but no, 
[4139.27 - 4143.27] no, you quite right. Yeah. So, 
[4141.24 - 4145.01] but to be able to do these 
[4143.34 - 4147.28] things as we continue, you 
[4145.07 - 4149.24] know, as the clock continues to 
[4147.34 - 4151.01] tick is is kind of dependent on 
[4149.31 - 4153.92] what I said earlier which is 
[4151.08 - 4156.48] the how. The how are we moving? 
[4153.98 - 4159.02] So, high intensity interval 
[4156.55 - 4160.52] training has its benefits 
[4159.09 - 4161.42] undoubtedly. We know that 
[4160.59 - 4163.49] high-intensity interval 
[4161.49 - 4165.89] training will give you the the 
[4163.56 - 4167.23] brain chemistry shift that will 
[4165.96 - 4169.60] lift and levitate the mood. But 
[4167.30 - 4172.07] there's also research that 
[4169.66 - 4174.50] shows that if we just move a 
[4172.13 - 4176.44] bit longer, we're going to have 
[4174.57 - 4178.51] the same or similar effect. So, 
[4176.51 - 4180.41] that maybe if you're not 
[4178.57 - 4181.84] working quite at such a high 
[4180.48 - 4183.08] intensity, you just need to do 
[4181.91 - 4185.48] it for that little bit longer 
[4183.15 - 4187.15] to have the same effect. And 
[4185.55 - 4189.45] the biggest thing that I see in 
[4187.22 - 4192.29] my clinic is that people who 
[4189.52 - 4194.59] suddenly embark on a new regime 
[4192.35 - 4195.86] of exercise, particularly over 
[4194.66 - 4196.56] lockdown. I mean, I was 
[4195.92 - 4199.06] horrified with some of the 
[4196.62 - 4203.16] things that people doing with 
[4199.13 - 4204.10] the online videos. Um you know 
[4203.23 - 4205.50] unsupervised. And the next 
[4204.17 - 4207.20] thing they're on the 
[4205.57 - 4208.50] physiotherapy couch. Because 
[4207.27 - 4210.94] they don't have the proper 
[4208.57 - 4212.44] form, the proper technique and 
[4211.01 - 4215.98] you know and our bodies are 
[4212.51 - 4217.38] becoming less resilient and 
[4216.05 - 4219.21] less. You're not 20 years 
[4217.45 - 4220.85] anymore. Well you know we wish 
[4219.28 - 4224.05] we were but the reality of the 
[4220.92 - 4224.89] situation is we're not. And our 
[4224.12 - 4226.15] tissues. You know we may be 
[4224.95 - 4229.56] really willing in the mind. But 
[4226.22 - 4231.43] the tissue are changing and and 
[4229.62 - 4233.66] you know what's this what's 
[4231.49 - 4235.40] that saying? The mind is 
[4233.73 - 4237.63] willing. The the the spirit is 
[4235.46 - 4239.23] willing but the flesh is weak. 
[4237.70 - 4240.47] And I think for you as a for a 
[4239.30 - 4241.77] for a as a physiotherapist 
[4240.54 - 4243.54] that's that's so that's so 
[4241.84 - 4245.47] true. Ah Phillipa this is some 
[4243.60 - 4247.68] amazing stuff that you have 
[4245.54 - 4250.28] shared with us that ah people 
[4247.74 - 4252.68] need to go long. People need to 
[4250.35 - 4255.18] go slow. Ah people need to not 
[4252.75 - 4257.45] ah injure their bodies. In fact 
[4255.25 - 4259.52] when I work out at my trainer 
[4257.52 - 4261.66] ah I am 4seven and I tell him I 
[4259.59 - 4262.36] got a slight pain over here. I 
[4261.72 - 4263.96] am putting the dumbbell down. 
[4262.42 - 4265.56] Come on sir. Come on sir. can 
[4264.03 - 4266.99] do another rep. I'm like live 
[4265.63 - 4268.60] to fight another day. I'm 
[4267.06 - 4270.13] going to be here when I'm 
[4268.66 - 4273.67] seventy-five in this gym. So, I 
[4270.20 - 4275.17] think ah my message to everyone 
[4273.73 - 4276.47] out there because I work with 
[4275.24 - 4277.97] Elite athletes and I see them 
[4276.54 - 4280.38] retire because they hurt. A 
[4278.04 - 4283.08] women going through menopause 
[4280.44 - 4284.68] You. cannot retire hurt. 
[4283.15 - 4286.28] Because retired hurt is you on 
[4284.75 - 4287.48] the couch and it means then I 
[4286.35 - 4288.82] have only the department of 
[4287.55 - 4290.92] nutrition to control your 
[4288.88 - 4292.85] weight which means a lot of 
[4290.99 - 4295.49] restrictions. Whereas if I have 
[4292.92 - 4296.73] with me, you could enjoy that 
[4295.56 - 4298.19] cheesecake, you could enjoy 
[4296.79 - 4300.90] that Snickers bar, you could 
[4298.26 - 4303.27] enjoy that ah in Paris with 
[4300.96 - 4304.53] your husband or new boyfriend 
[4303.33 - 4306.10] if you are going through 
[4304.60 - 4309.04] menopause I. don't know but the 
[4306.17 - 4312.71] whole point is go slow and 
[4309.10 - 4315.38] steady on your body and it's 
[4312.77 - 4317.08] like I do know that all women 
[4315.44 - 4319.05] in the planet have an immense 
[4317.15 - 4320.61] amount of patience. So, when 
[4319.11 - 4321.32] they have that patience, I 
[4320.68 - 4324.59] would say have patience with 
[4321.38 - 4326.55] your pillar instructor. Don't 
[4324.65 - 4328.99] go to her and say ah could I 
[4326.62 - 4330.89] fit into this dress in the next 
[4329.06 - 4332.86] 14 days? Because that's when 
[4330.96 - 4334.56] Christmas is coming up. It's 
[4332.93 - 4336.90] like no. More like fourteen 
[4334.63 - 4338.60] months. That would be the more 
[4336.97 - 4340.94] realistic ah trend. Phillipa we 
[4338.67 - 4342.67] have been going great at this 
[4341.00 - 4344.54] session. Ah you know ah we are 
[4342.74 - 4346.54] getting a lot of questions that 
[4344.61 - 4347.81] are coming in. Ah but since our 
[4346.61 - 4349.18] time is restricted you are a 
[4347.88 - 4351.45] very busy person. I know that 
[4349.24 - 4352.95] as am I and it's a Sunday want 
[4351.51 - 4354.52] to get back to our families. 
[4353.02 - 4356.72] What I propose is I am going to 
[4354.58 - 4358.72] ask my team to get all these 
[4356.78 - 4360.02] questions together. We're 
[4358.79 - 4361.86] going to figure out those 
[4360.09 - 4364.43] questions in terms of written 
[4361.92 - 4366.46] answers and when this video 
[4364.49 - 4368.73] will be recorded and go online 
[4366.53 - 4370.50] on our YouTube channels, we'll 
[4368.80 - 4373.27] put it in the descriptor as our 
[4370.57 - 4375.47] Q and As answered also. So, 
[4373.34 - 4377.87] it's a resource for people with 
[4375.54 - 4379.57] menopause, women with menopause 
[4377.94 - 4382.11] where they can come and 
[4379.64 - 4385.15] understand and let's do, I'll 
[4382.18 - 4386.21] go first. What are my top five 
[4385.21 - 4389.25] or 10 tips for women watching 
[4386.28 - 4390.69] in? So, summary One, get a 
[4389.32 - 4391.82] blood test. Phillipa, you're, 
[4390.75 - 4392.92] going to come in. What are the 
[4391.89 - 4394.82] ten tips for for exercise, 
[4392.99 - 4396.12] alright? So, I am going first. 
[4394.89 - 4397.33] So, I am thinking from the 
[4396.19 - 4399.56] nutrition department, get a 
[4397.39 - 4400.19] blood test. If you can find out 
[4399.63 - 4402.73] if you can do a nutrition 
[4400.26 - 4404.03] genetic test, get that. If you 
[4402.80 - 4405.37] got a little extra money, get a 
[4404.10 - 4406.64] microbiome test, okay? So, that 
[4405.43 - 4408.10] will really tell us about the 
[4406.70 - 4409.97] gut health. Do a food 
[4408.17 - 4410.94] intolerance, food allergy test 
[4410.04 - 4412.11] because you are getting older. 
[4411.01 - 4415.64] So, you don't want to put the 
[4412.17 - 4417.48] food that's like that if you 
[4415.71 - 4419.71] have a nagging husband. So, it 
[4417.55 - 4420.35] of that intolerant food like 
[4419.78 - 4421.68] your nagging husband, right? 
[4420.41 - 4422.72] So, you want to, you want to 
[4421.75 - 4424.15] get, you want to get the nice 
[4422.78 - 4424.99] husband into you which is, you 
[4424.22 - 4426.42] know, you can't change your 
[4425.05 - 4428.09] husband, yeah, you can but if 
[4426.49 - 4429.22] if you want, you could change 
[4428.16 - 4431.49] the food very easily. So, I'm 
[4429.29 - 4432.96] giving you that tip, figure out 
[4431.56 - 4434.66] the cranky foods that are 
[4433.03 - 4435.60] irritating your gut, your 
[4434.73 - 4437.40] hormones. Get that out of the 
[4435.66 - 4438.47] way. Weight train, weight 
[4437.47 - 4441.57] train, weight train, with 
[4438.53 - 4443.67] Pilates yoga, walking, walking 
[4441.64 - 4445.27] is one exercise that burns fat. 
[4443.74 - 4449.04] I have helped women lose 17 KGs 
[4445.34 - 4450.44] of fat in two time. Fit into 
[4449.11 - 4452.01] dresses that they fitted at 
[4450.51 - 4454.85] their wedding time. But it was 
[4452.08 - 4456.12] two years of walking. It is not 
[4454.92 - 4458.45] ten thousand steps ladies. 
[4456.18 - 4460.39] 10000 is weight maintenance. 
[4458.52 - 4462.49] More you've got it's like it's 
[4460.45 - 4463.26] like a bank balance. Right? 
[4462.56 - 4465.29] Your husband gives you some 
[4463.32 - 4466.09] money, you want to spend it. 
[4465.36 - 4467.13] Over here you've got a fixed 
[4466.16 - 4469.13] deposit which is called fact. 
[4467.19 - 4472.13] You need to spend. Spend is 
[4469.20 - 4473.44] your exercise. Eating is 
[4472.20 - 4475.14] deposits. I cannot restrict 
[4473.50 - 4477.01] your eating down to zero. I 
[4475.20 - 4478.77] have to give you food to 
[4477.07 - 4479.94] nutritionally survive. So keep 
[4478.84 - 4481.44] this as a very very important 
[4480.01 - 4482.04] point. During your 
[4481.51 - 4484.21] perimenopause and menopause. 
[4482.11 - 4486.41] You have to eat. You have to 
[4484.28 - 4489.02] take nutritional supplements. 
[4486.48 - 4490.65] My top guys would be a protein 
[4489.08 - 4491.99] supplement. Preferably a soy 
[4490.72 - 4493.69] protein. If you are not 
[4492.05 - 4495.26] allergic to soy, a green pea 
[4493.76 - 4498.56] protein isolate. Uh there are 
[4495.32 - 4500.16] few nice brands on the market. 
[4498.63 - 4501.90] Go for an organic plant based 
[4500.23 - 4504.13] protein. If you are not 
[4501.96 - 4506.77] allergic to milk and you are 
[4504.20 - 4508.17] not in in the family of breast 
[4506.84 - 4509.67] cancer in ovarian cancer, then 
[4508.24 - 4511.11] may be dairy is okay. So, a 
[4509.74 - 4514.08] whey protein or a casein 
[4511.17 - 4516.08] protein. multivitamin. Yes, 
[4514.14 - 4518.48] yes, yes. But check your 
[4516.14 - 4520.41] calcium, magnesium, iron genes. 
[4518.55 - 4522.95] I highly recommend coenzyme Q10 
[4520.48 - 4525.52] if you are on a statin. I 
[4523.02 - 4528.56] highly recommend that you could 
[4525.59 - 4530.56] use coffee, one or two cups a 
[4528.62 - 4531.23] day. If you are a caffeine 
[4530.63 - 4533.56] responder as per your genetic 
[4531.29 - 4535.10] test. If you are a cafe non 
[4533.63 - 4536.53] responder taking caffeine 
[4535.16 - 4538.97] increases your incidences of 
[4536.60 - 4540.67] stroke and heart attack. 
[4539.03 - 4543.90] Finally, vitamin C, collagen 
[4540.74 - 4545.57] and D should be your best 
[4543.97 - 4547.34] friends. I repeat, vitamin C, 
[4545.64 - 4548.48] vitamin D and collagen should 
[4547.41 - 4549.78] be your best friends. They are 
[4548.54 - 4551.08] anti ageing, they are great on 
[4549.85 - 4552.48] your skin. There is a lot you 
[4551.15 - 4554.95] could get in touch with me, 
[4552.55 - 4555.98] Ryan Fernando we, do global 
[4555.02 - 4558.19] nutritional counselling for 
[4556.05 - 4559.99] women. I don't do ah the the 
[4558.25 - 4562.09] nutritional counselling as much 
[4560.05 - 4564.02] as my talented dietitians. I 
[4562.16 - 4564.93] have a few specialist 
[4564.09 - 4567.23] dietitians who deal with the 
[4564.99 - 4568.83] female hormonal cycle. Ah and 
[4567.30 - 4569.83] so if you are facing problems 
[4568.90 - 4570.53] or wherever you are in the 
[4569.90 - 4572.60] world, we can guide you to get 
[4570.60 - 4574.04] the diagnostics and then you 
[4572.67 - 4576.34] can work on Zoom with us. 
[4574.10 - 4581.51] Phillipa your, top five or ten 
[4576.40 - 4584.11] tips. my top tip is start small 
[4581.58 - 4586.15] and build it up. Because if we 
[4584.18 - 4588.08] start with unrealistic 
[4586.21 - 4589.38] expectations then we're just 
[4588.15 - 4592.15] we're going to fall at the 
[4589.45 - 4595.12] first hurdle. Have a goal in 
[4592.22 - 4597.53] mind and and map out a journey 
[4595.19 - 4598.93] to that goal. So something 
[4597.59 - 4601.96] every day if we can fit it in. 
[4598.99 - 4604.50] And if not 5 days out of seven. 
[4602.03 - 4608.00] So somewhere in the region of 
[4604.57 - 4610.57] 40 minutes every day 20 to 40 
[4608.07 - 4612.61] minutes every day of The 
[4610.64 - 4614.44] walking you mentioned but for 
[4612.67 - 4616.64] me from a Pilates perspective, 
[4614.51 - 4618.65] what I'm looking to do is to 
[4616.71 - 4620.52] build those muscles and for 
[4618.71 - 4622.72] somewhere in the region of 20 
[4620.58 - 4625.05] minutes every day or sorry, 
[4622.78 - 4626.49] three times a week to do some 
[4625.12 - 4628.99] kind of muscle building 
[4626.56 - 4631.49] activity. And so I incorporate 
[4629.06 - 4633.96] into my sessions, resistance, 
[4631.56 - 4636.80] equipment, it could be, as you 
[4634.03 - 4638.13] said, awaited hand weight or a 
[4636.86 - 4641.00] rubber resistance band. And, 
[4638.20 - 4642.57] actually this morning did an 
[4641.07 - 4644.14] amazing new workout with a 
[4642.64 - 4647.47] broom handle, would you believe 
[4644.21 - 4649.21] it? And a towel from the airing 
[4647.54 - 4650.65] cupboard. So, you know, there, 
[4649.28 - 4652.28] you don't have to invest in 
[4650.71 - 4654.88] expensive equipment for it to 
[4652.35 - 4658.55] be totally and 100 percent 
[4654.95 - 4660.12] effective. Keep it simple and 
[4658.62 - 4662.72] you're much more likely to to 
[4660.19 - 4664.99] achieve your goals. And you 
[4662.79 - 4666.43] know, take guidance because it, 
[4665.06 - 4668.56] there's a whole world of 
[4666.49 - 4672.47] difference between a squat and 
[4668.63 - 4675.04] a squat if you do it right, if 
[4672.53 - 4676.90] you do it well. And you know 
[4675.10 - 4678.97] the joints are not going to be 
[4676.97 - 4680.54] thanking us if we're not using 
[4679.04 - 4682.28] the proper technique, the 
[4680.61 - 4683.88] proper form. And with the 
[4682.34 - 4685.75] passage of time, this just 
[4683.94 - 4689.48] becomes more and more important 
[4685.81 - 4691.15] to do these movements well. 
[4689.55 - 4693.62] We'll move well and you know 
[4691.22 - 4695.22] what? We'll feel well as a 
[4693.69 - 4697.82] consequence of doing that. It's 
[4695.29 - 4698.53] so so important to incorporate 
[4697.89 - 4702.06] some movement into every bit of 
[4698.59 - 4703.70] our I already mentioned putting 
[4702.13 - 4705.53] through putting every joint in 
[4703.77 - 4707.67] your body through its full 
[4705.60 - 4709.54] range of motion every day. I 
[4707.74 - 4711.64] mean, you know, we don't even 
[4709.60 - 4715.61] think about our fingers, our 
[4711.71 - 4718.95] hands, our wrists, you know, 
[4715.68 - 4721.45] with the ability to isolate 
[4719.01 - 4724.52] movements to one bit of us is 
[4721.52 - 4727.12] is really something that, yeah,

[4732.16 - 4734.96] session with you, questions are 
[4733.23 - 4735.66] coming in. If people want to do 
[4735.03 - 4736.93] sessions with you, you are 
[4735.73 - 4739.47] saying keep it simple, move the 
[4737.00 - 4741.94] range of joints, take guidance. 
[4739.53 - 4743.57] So, where do I find Doctor 
[4742.00 - 4744.97] Phillipa Butler Where? do I 
[4743.64 - 4748.44] find you? Well, I'm online.

[4748.51 - 4752.51] Precision.co.UK and you know 
[4749.51 - 4755.38] what? It's spelled with a Z. P 
[4752.58 - 4759.55] R E. Yeah. So, don't don't put 
[4755.45 - 4761.96] the S in there. P R E C I Z I O 
[4759.62 - 4765.06] N. That was, you know, extra 
[4762.02 - 4766.43] kind of funky in the in the I 
[4765.13 - 4768.60] am thinking you are trying to 
[4766.49 - 4771.10] do an ed in the yoga pose kind 
[4768.66 - 4772.70] of thing. It's been wonderful 
[4771.17 - 4775.07] having you Phillipa It's. been 
[4772.77 - 4777.01] amazing. I hope people in New 
[4775.14 - 4780.48] York to Sydney across the 
[4777.07 - 4781.98] world. Uh have access to this. 
[4780.54 - 4784.35] The aim of today to get 
[4782.04 - 4787.38] Phillipa on board was 
[4784.41 - 4790.45] menopausal women should workout 
[4787.45 - 4793.05] out. Muscle is the only age 
[4790.52 - 4795.06] reversible organ. Uh your 
[4793.12 - 4797.03] hormones are driven by your 
[4795.12 - 4799.99] nutritive molecules into your 
[4797.09 - 4801.80] life. Get an understanding of 
[4800.06 - 4805.30] the good nutrition that can 
[4801.86 - 4808.10] help you get aware. Figure out 
[4805.37 - 4810.44] the lack of molecules in you. 
[4808.17 - 4812.07] Whether it's nutritive or 
[4810.51 - 4813.91] hormonal. Figure it out with 
[4812.14 - 4815.88] your doctor. Figure it out with 
[4813.98 - 4819.01] your nutritionist. Figure it 
[4815.94 - 4820.98] out with your body instructor. 
[4819.08 - 4823.08] And once you get that done 
[4821.05 - 4823.98] figure out the pain points in 
[4823.15 - 4827.32] your life. The pain points 
[4824.05 - 4828.92] could from exercise, get an 
[4827.39 - 4831.09] expert. The pain points could 
[4828.99 - 4833.03] come from a nutrition issue, 
[4831.16 - 4834.96] get an expert. The pain point 
[4833.09 - 4836.53] which we did not discuss today 
[4835.03 - 4839.00] could come from an emotional 
[4836.60 - 4840.64] standpoint. But that's another 
[4839.07 - 4843.37] discussion for another day 
[4840.70 - 4844.91] where we talk about the mind 
[4843.44 - 4847.61] health of women and and how 
[4844.97 - 4849.14] they go through that. And we'll 
[4847.68 - 4850.28] get you back on board again 
[4849.21 - 4852.45] Phillipa when we get the mind 
[4850.34 - 4853.38] coach again. So this has been 
[4852.51 - 4856.55] an amazing amazing session with 
[4853.45 - 4858.22] everyone. you for tuning in as 
[4856.62 - 4860.92] in as in traditional Indian
