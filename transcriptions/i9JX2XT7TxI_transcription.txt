Transcript: coffee has one of the highest amount of antioxidants on the planet so I don't recommend too many cups of coffee but one to two cups of coffee in the day can help an individual get not only the caffeine which stimulates the brain but just the antioxidants and my all-time favorite is dark chocolate in the exam season I would tell every kid have hot cocoa before you study don't eat a chocolate bar because of the sugar in it which is going and cancel out the benefits but I'm talking about dark chocolate put it in a hot chocolate mix that's got a lot of sugar also right no you put a lot of sugar because you had sugar so when you do your drinking chocolate it's loaded with 55 60% sugar so you've got a train people you got to train your palette not to take so much of sugar
