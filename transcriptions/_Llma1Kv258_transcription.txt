[2.34 - 8.70] I think to start with every adult should
[6.06 - 10.68] know some very basic numbers okay you
[8.70 - 12.24] must know your height and weight I know
[10.68 - 14.76] I'm stating the obvious but there are so
[12.24 - 16.86] many people who don't you must know at
[14.76 - 20.22] least once you're your blood pressure
[16.86 - 22.02] your cholesterol your sugar these are
[20.22 - 24.42] all simple things which can be done with
[22.02 - 26.16] one simple inexpensive blood test and
[24.42 - 28.20] somebody measuring your blood pressure
[26.16 - 30.54] the problem is these are all silent
[28.20 - 32.64] issues all these three big ones blood
[30.54 - 35.76] pressure cholesterol and sugar if your
[32.64 - 37.98] numbers are way high you won't know it
[35.76 - 40.02] until you measure it so if you ask a
[37.98 - 41.76] room full of people do you have you know
[40.02 - 43.38] high cholesterol very few people may put
[41.76 - 45.06] the hand down but then if you ask them
[43.38 - 47.04] how many of you are actually measured in
[45.06 - 48.84] the last one year again very few people
[47.04 - 50.76] will put the hand down so you can't
[48.84 - 52.26] assume you've got good cholesterol or
[50.76 - 54.30] sugar or blood pressure until you
[52.26 - 56.82] measure it so if this is the minimum
[54.30 - 60.00] testing you need to do once a year now
[56.82 - 62.52] if any of these numbers come High then
[60.00 - 64.86] yes you need to test further something
[62.52 - 67.44] else I would two more points I would add
[64.86 - 69.96] if somebody has a strong family history
[67.44 - 72.36] of heart disease by that I mean some
[69.96 - 76.14] direct relation mother father brother
[72.36 - 78.18] sister has has died young when I say
[76.14 - 80.88] young say below the age of 60 not just
[78.18 - 83.16] had a heart disease but died young below
[80.88 - 85.68] the age of 60. that would be a sort of a
[83.16 - 88.08] long Bell in my mind so speak to your
[85.68 - 91.14] doctor he or she may want you to do
[88.08 - 93.66] further tests if you want to embark on
[91.14 - 95.64] vigorous exercise right not just a
[93.66 - 99.36] simple wrist walking program if you want
[95.64 - 100.92] to embark on invigorous exercise talk to
[99.36 - 104.12] your doctor to see whether additional
[100.92 - 104.12] tests are required or not
