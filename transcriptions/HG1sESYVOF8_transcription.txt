[3.00 - 7.00] stress and sleep uh when it comes to
[5.00 - 10.00] stress it's a very very important to
[7.00 - 15.04] find a way to declutter your brain every
[10.00 - 16.76] day we get about 23 to 25 GB worth of
[15.04 - 18.60] information that our brain has to
[16.76 - 20.56] process right so think about your
[18.60 - 23.16] computers and when it crashes and the
[20.56 - 25.28] hard disk essentially stress levels are
[23.16 - 27.88] related to how much processing you're
[25.28 - 30.16] doing and not allowing your brain to
[27.88 - 33.16] figure out what's important to keep what
[30.16 - 35.92] to discard and what to not worry about
[33.16 - 37.72] so decluttering is important and that
[35.92 - 39.88] comes in a number of different ways it
[37.72 - 41.64] could be taking a very very short mini

[41.64 - 45.60] city so that you just have less visual
[43.48 - 48.28] stimulation it could be locking yourself
[45.60 - 49.76] up and just reading a book with nobody
[48.28 - 51.88] around you because then you're focused

[58.40 - 63.04] and good quality sleep because it's
