[0.04 - 4.96] did you know that it can take up to 13
[2.28 - 6.36] years for some women to get correctly
[4.96 - 10.76] diagnosed with
[6.36 - 13.12] PCOS over 50% of women with PCOS report
[10.76 - 15.20] that it negatively affects their work
[13.12 - 18.12] with some even missing work due to
[15.20 - 21.28] symptoms in India the number of PCOS
[18.12 - 24.12] cases is on the rise so I had to make
[21.28 - 26.20] this video this video will explain
[24.12 - 28.84] everything about this condition let's
[26.20 - 31.36] get started now pcus is a hormonal
[28.84 - 35.28] disorder that affects up to 10% of the
[31.36 - 36.24] women of reproductive age between 1990
[35.28 - 39.44] and
[36.24 - 40.88] 2019 the incident of pcus increased
[39.44 - 43.76] globally by
[40.88 - 47.00] 54% with the highest rates among
[43.76 - 49.28] teenagers age 15 to 19 this condition
[47.00 - 52.12] involves irregular menstrual cycles
[49.28 - 55.16] excess Androgen levels and polycystic
[52.12 - 57.36] ovaries leading to symptoms like acne
[55.16 - 59.84] hair loss difficulty with weight
[57.36 - 61.60] management it can also increase the risk
[59.84 - 64.20] of of serious health issues like
[61.60 - 67.04] diabetes heart disease infertility and
[64.20 - 70.04] even depression pcus is one of the
[67.04 - 75.24] leading causes of infertility and is
[70.04 - 77.60] responsible for 70% of the cases of anov
[75.24 - 81.44] infertility there are several common
[77.60 - 83.96] misconceptions about pcus first it's not
[81.44 - 87.16] just a reproductive disorder it's a
[83.96 - 90.08] complex endocrine disorder that can also
[87.16 - 94.48] impact metabolic and psychological
[90.08 - 97.60] health for example 37% of women with PCS
[94.48 - 100.52] experience depression compared to 14.2%
[97.60 - 104.04] of those without PCS another myth is
[100.52 - 106.16] that all women with PCS are overweight
[104.04 - 107.96] while weight gain is common due to
[106.16 - 111.80] insulin resistance and hormonal
[107.96 - 113.88] imbalance lean women can also have PCS
[111.80 - 116.64] some believe that PCS goes away after
[113.88 - 119.68] menopause although some symptoms like
[116.64 - 122.16] irregular periods May naturally resolve
[119.68 - 125.56] that underlining metabolic and hormonal
[122.16 - 128.52] imbalances can still persist and no
[125.56 - 131.56] birth control pills do not cure pcus
[128.52 - 133.88] they help regulate the menstrual cycles
[131.56 - 136.48] and reduce Androgen levels but the
[133.88 - 138.56] underlying hormonal imbalance actually
[136.48 - 140.72] remains lifestyle changes and other
[138.56 - 143.24] treatments are often needed to manage
[140.72 - 146.08] the condition comprehensively women with
[143.24 - 148.68] PCS face several challenges diagnostic
[146.08 - 153.48] delays are common with an average delay
[148.68 - 155.72] of over 4 years up to 52% women report
[153.48 - 158.60] receiving insufficient information from
[155.72 - 161.24] their Healthcare Providers and about 70%
[158.60 - 164.40] feel dismissed or not listened to by
[161.24 - 167.60] their doctors many General Practitioners
[164.40 - 170.96] lack the necessary training to diagnose
[167.60 - 173.20] and manage pcus effectively leading to
[170.96 - 175.44] dissatisfaction among patients now
[173.20 - 177.36] listen in closely apart from the usual
[175.44 - 180.12] symptoms of PCS such as irregular
[177.36 - 182.52] menstrual cycles excess Androgen levels
[180.12 - 184.24] polycystic ovaries insulin resistance
[182.52 - 186.52] weight gain acne thinning of hair on the
[184.24 - 189.40] scalp there are other symptoms that you
[186.52 - 190.92] might not be aware of and these are
[189.40 - 192.48] darkening of the skin particularly in
[190.92 - 195.40] the areas like the neck groin or
[192.48 - 197.96] underarms watch for this the other
[195.40 - 201.44] symptom could be pelvic pains which can
[197.96 - 204.24] be irregular or less directly related to
[201.44 - 206.28] the menstrual cycle headaches or
[204.24 - 209.04] migraines linked to hormonal imbalances
[206.28 - 211.76] they're quite common sleep apnea or
[209.04 - 212.88] snoring and this disturbs your sleep
[211.76 - 215.00] especially in the women who are
[212.88 - 216.76] overweight or have insulin resistance
[215.00 - 219.32] dry or flaky skin due to hormonal
[216.76 - 221.76] changes is huge digestive issues like
[219.32 - 223.08] bloating or irregular ball movements
[221.76 - 224.96] potentially related to insulin
[223.08 - 227.16] resistance or other metabolic changes is
[224.96 - 229.60] often seen now traditional medicine
[227.16 - 233.12] often focuses on managing the symptoms
[229.60 - 236.08] of PCS through medication or surgical
[233.12 - 238.04] interventions however holistic aspects
[236.08 - 239.88] are sometimes overlooked I would like to
[238.04 - 242.64] mention some points I think that we all
[239.88 - 245.72] know about them but we do not practice
[242.64 - 248.08] them thoroughly first one stress
[245.72 - 251.24] management techniques like mindfulness
[248.08 - 252.96] yoga meditation and relaxation exercises
[251.24 - 255.20] can really help you manage your stress
[252.96 - 257.16] and improve your overall well-being
[255.20 - 259.56] actionable steps will be waking up a
[257.16 - 262.52] little early starting with 30 minutes
[259.56 - 264.44] and with time build consistency which
[262.52 - 266.96] will help you in your breath work yoga
[264.44 - 269.36] meditation or any exercise which can be
[266.96 - 271.52] scaled up to 1 hour by the way if you
[269.36 - 274.12] don't know where to start I've pasted a
[271.52 - 276.32] link to my favorite guided breath work
[274.12 - 279.12] videos the link is in the description
[276.32 - 281.56] below tune in and kick to your day but
[279.12 - 284.00] to rise early you need to sleep well
[281.56 - 286.64] which brings me to my second Point Sleep
[284.00 - 289.44] Quality post sleep can negatively impact
[286.64 - 291.32] hormonal balance and insulin sensitivity
[289.44 - 293.44] ensuring good sleep hygiene and
[291.32 - 295.32] addressing any sleep orders that can
[293.44 - 298.28] support overall health and symptom
[295.32 - 300.92] management so what do I do go easy on
[298.28 - 303.68] your dinner and finish it off 3 hours
[300.92 - 306.76] prior after that don't use too much of a
[303.68 - 309.60] screen with blue light TV go easy wind
[306.76 - 312.56] down read a book some calming music warm
[309.60 - 314.56] lights mild hot showers read a nice
[312.56 - 316.96] fictional book this will help you sleep
[314.56 - 319.00] or get sleepy faster you know what even
[316.96 - 321.00] herbal and complimentary therapies may
[319.00 - 323.60] work some herbal supplements and
[321.00 - 326.52] complimentary therapies like spearmint
[323.60 - 329.12] te for reducing excess hair growth or
[326.52 - 331.72] even acupuncture for hormonal balance
[329.12 - 333.40] may often additional support gut health
[331.72 - 335.52] the health of the gut microbiome can
[333.40 - 338.00] influence inflammation and hormonal
[335.52 - 339.96] balance so eat foods that support your
[338.00 - 341.96] gut health what works for me doesn't
[339.96 - 343.88] work for you so your gut needs a
[341.96 - 345.24] personalized diet now I practiced at the
[343.88 - 347.60] qua nutrition clinics where we do
[345.24 - 350.04] needful tests like microbiome testing
[347.60 - 352.12] food intolerance testing genetic testing
[350.04 - 354.28] and even the normal blood test before we
[352.12 - 356.44] plan the diet so to get yours there's a
[354.28 - 359.04] link to a Google form in my description
[356.44 - 361.92] below please fill it out and my team can
[359.04 - 364.76] get back to with the earliest now PCOS
[361.92 - 367.76] can be presented in different phenotypes
[364.76 - 369.96] including hyperandrogenic ovulatory
[367.76 - 372.32] nonovulatory and
[369.96 - 374.32] Mild understanding that not all
[372.32 - 377.00] individuals with PCS have the same
[374.32 - 379.12] symptoms helps in tailoring treatment
[377.00 - 382.68] and avoiding a one-size fits-all
[379.12 - 384.80] approach in conclusion PCOS is not just
[382.68 - 387.16] a reproductive disorder but also
[384.80 - 390.20] influences your metabolic and
[387.16 - 392.48] psychological Health women with PC us
[390.20 - 395.16] are at a risk of being diagnosed very
[392.48 - 397.60] late or misdiagnosed due to a knowledge
[395.16 - 400.56] Gap among practitioners besides the
[397.60 - 403.72] usual symptoms PCOS can also lead to
[400.56 - 406.88] skin darkening pelvic pains and problems
[403.72 - 409.28] like sleep apnea therefore I believe
[406.88 - 412.56] managing diet and exercising are the
[409.28 - 414.88] most common methods of managing PCS but
[412.56 - 417.04] methods such as Mental Health Management
[414.88 - 420.72] sleep hygiene maintenance and herbal
[417.04 - 422.56] therapies are often overlooked PCOS can
[420.72 - 424.60] manifest in different ways in different
[422.56 - 427.08] people so it's important to get a full
[424.60 - 429.72] body checkup once in a while to help in
[427.08 - 431.68] early diagnosis and the management of
[429.72 - 434.12] the disease so if you're someone who has
[431.68 - 436.36] been diagnosed with PCS tell us your
[434.12 - 438.44] story of how you first found out about
[436.36 - 440.36] it in the comment section below we'd
