[0.12 - 5.84] recently a patient who came back with
[2.44 - 8.92] severe nerve damage after getting an IV
[5.84 - 12.08] drip from a salon so if you go to a
[8.92 - 14.32] completely unqualified untrained person
[12.08 - 16.24] major things can go wrong what you may
[14.32 - 18.88] think is just an acne cream or what you
[16.24 - 20.92] may think is just a small laser may
[18.88 - 23.24] actually cause a lot of harm if you're
[20.92 - 26.20] not done in the right way if not you
[23.24 - 28.68] could actually go blind is this why it's
[26.20 - 30.68] better to take a face massage at a
[28.68 - 33.28] Dermatology Clinic
[30.68 - 34.96] rather than one of these Spas where that
[33.28 - 37.60] person like like rubbing your face and
[34.96 - 40.80] going at it how important is nutrition
[37.60 - 43.28] to you to me skin is just literally like
[40.80 - 46.00] a diagnostic tool for what's happening
[43.28 - 48.04] inside for example if there's anemia
[46.00 - 50.56] skin is pale if there's excess sugar
[48.04 - 52.24] skin looks dark protein goes down you
[50.56 - 56.00] can actually see brittle hair brittle
[52.24 - 58.48] nails so everything is about what you
[56.00 - 60.68] have put into you is what is seen
[58.48 - 63.28] outside I think our grandmothers were
[60.68 - 65.92] younger because they also didn't kill
[63.28 - 69.92] themselves to stay lean I stayed you
[65.92 - 72.68] won't believe between 50 and 53 kgs all
[69.92 - 74.80] my life and these days teenagers are so
[72.68 - 76.48] paranoid about losing their hair this is
[74.80 - 78.80] huge right now they are scared to wash
[76.48 - 81.52] their hair they think washing hair leads
[78.80 - 83.60] to hair fall which is a big myth now
[81.52 - 85.52] what do I do all of us want to look

[180.64 - 185.96] hey it's a great day I've got a
[182.84 - 188.20] celebrity in town and this person makes
[185.96 - 191.24] you and me look more and more beautiful
[188.20 - 193.32] as we grow older Dr Rashmi welcome to my
[191.24 - 194.92] podcast great to have you here today
[193.32 - 196.32] thank you Ryan I've actually been
[194.92 - 197.96] waiting for a chitchat with you because
[196.32 - 200.60] I have my own personal questions about
[197.96 - 202.96] nutrition I know and you know I I wanted
[200.60 - 205.28] to ask you this question which is uh
[202.96 - 207.16] when I came in I was like I forgot my
[205.28 - 209.28] biochemistry from Goa Medical College
[207.16 - 211.72] and my Dean would say Ryan you need to
[209.28 - 214.80] be better so my first question was is
[211.72 - 216.60] skin dead or is skin alive and I was
[214.80 - 218.84] wondering where which part is dead and
[216.60 - 221.44] which part is alive so portion of it is
[218.84 - 225.00] dead obviously a large portion is alive
[221.44 - 227.72] only the top layer the stratum coronium
[225.00 - 231.52] is almost a dead layer is a dead layer
[227.72 - 233.76] so it's just the Keratin that is put out
[231.52 - 237.16] with let's say clumped melanin what is
[233.76 - 239.84] this keratin keratin is a protein so
[237.16 - 243.68] cells die and become protein whether it
[239.84 - 246.84] is here or um I'm sure you dive deep
[243.68 - 249.88] into anti-aging molecular sence yourself
[246.84 - 252.44] so if you look at the mtor theory it is
[249.88 - 254.48] dead protein which is hanging around
[252.44 - 257.44] various tissues which cause the
[254.48 - 261.00] inflammation so any tissue which kind of
[257.44 - 265.36] stops its function grows and finishes
[261.00 - 267.20] its function and dies now in skin we die
[265.36 - 269.28] and we throw that out correct so we
[267.20 - 272.24] share a lot of skin every day yeah you
[269.28 - 274.60] every day you end up there was some um
[272.24 - 277.28] person I can't remember the name said
[274.60 - 280.36] that it was in a movie controversially
[277.28 - 283.64] said how a whole load of dust in the
[280.36 - 285.92] house is skin cells skin cells so it it
[283.64 - 289.44] was in a controversial skin of color
[285.92 - 292.56] movie so it it is it skin there which is
[289.44 - 294.88] actually dead and fallen down um so the
[292.56 - 298.56] Dead part of the skin is the outermost
[294.88 - 300.60] layer of the outer layer so you have the
[298.56 - 302.60] dermis and the EP epidermis right the
[300.60 - 304.68] epidermis is the outer layer so EP is
[302.60 - 307.36] the outer layer correct EP is the outer
[304.68 - 309.68] so there is dermis which is Derm is skin
[307.36 - 312.72] dermology comes from there okay so there
[309.68 - 317.00] is dermis then there is epidermis then
[312.72 - 318.76] there is subdermis also so these are the
[317.00 - 321.32] pretty much layers of the skin that you
[318.76 - 323.48] feel underneath subdermis is usually the
[321.32 - 325.84] fat that you see in the skin then you
[323.48 - 328.08] have the dermis which is the layer where
[325.84 - 330.44] there is lot of blood vessels collagen
[328.08 - 332.24] elastin ground substance all of that
[330.44 - 333.88] that makes the bulk of the skin is it
[332.24 - 335.56] true that the skin is the largest organ
[333.88 - 337.44] in the human body it's enveloping and
[335.56 - 339.08] wrapping the whole thing right so it is
[337.44 - 341.68] the largest if you consider skin an
[339.08 - 344.32] organ yeah then it is the largest body
[341.68 - 346.44] surface Dr Rashmi tell me something is
[344.32 - 348.32] skin also there in Our arteries and
[346.44 - 350.32] blood vessels could we call that skin or
[348.32 - 352.76] that's something different no that is
[350.32 - 354.92] that is that is um endothelium we call
[352.76 - 357.52] it so that is different that behaves
[354.92 - 358.96] very differently so you know if I was
[357.52 - 360.88] like a construction guy and I had to
[358.96 - 362.88] construct a house I use bricks in the
[360.88 - 364.92] bathroom I use bricks in the hall I use
[362.88 - 367.12] bricks in the but you would do various
[364.92 - 369.24] the bricks inside the house and the
[367.12 - 371.32] outside you are making it weatherproof
[369.24 - 373.60] so the brick would be different so
[371.32 - 375.84] outside you may use a slightly rougher
[373.60 - 378.48] material but you are more trying to do a
[375.84 - 380.28] barrier so it shouldn't you know put
[378.48 - 382.52] water inside from the rain water cannot
[380.28 - 384.00] get absorbed and get into your house so
[382.52 - 386.36] thinking of various properties for that
[384.00 - 388.28] brick while an endothelium is a
[386.36 - 390.48] different kind of a brick where you're
[388.28 - 392.76] looking at more for example the gut
[390.48 - 396.00] endothelium you're looking at some kind
[392.76 - 399.04] of exchange there or the endothelium of
[396.00 - 400.88] your let's say the lung or this now
[399.04 - 402.72] explains to me why a dermatologist is
[400.88 - 404.84] not a
[402.72 - 407.92] gastroenterologist so so for everyone
[404.84 - 410.60] out there the simplest term is a
[407.92 - 413.12] dermatologist is a skin doctor so in
[410.60 - 417.32] India a dermatologist is not just a
[413.12 - 421.32] dermatologist our degree is either a DVD
[417.32 - 423.52] or a ddv or an MD in dermatology our
[421.32 - 426.60] whole body is called as Indian
[423.52 - 429.96] association of dermatologist venerology
[426.60 - 433.76] and leolist okay so it's the DV is
[429.96 - 437.24] diseases of skin sexually transmitted
[433.76 - 440.28] diseases and leprosy so in India the
[437.24 - 443.32] degree is all of this put together but a
[440.28 - 446.32] lot of us don't practice everything okay
[443.32 - 449.56] for example I've never seen leprosy
[446.32 - 451.44] patients after my passing out of college
[449.56 - 453.28] so if somebody would come to me it would
[451.44 - 455.08] be disservice for me to say just because
[453.28 - 457.20] I have the degree I can treat leprosy
[455.08 - 459.76] because I don't know the latest advances
[457.20 - 460.96] or I don't know what is medicine at the
[459.76 - 463.60] end of the day practice it's still
[460.96 - 466.96] called a practice right so if I haven't
[463.60 - 469.80] practiced seeing venerology or leprology
[466.96 - 471.96] for this many years I'm not best at it
[469.80 - 475.08] so when you say you practice what is
[471.96 - 479.20] your normal day like oh my God crazy it
[475.08 - 480.48] is now I in practice or in general to
[479.20 - 483.28] day
[480.48 - 485.40] both in general I wake up I was I was
[483.28 - 491.32] joking yesterday with one of my
[485.40 - 493.00] cousins 5 57 or 5:51 is when I wake up
[491.32 - 495.00] and it'll be the same for many many many
[493.00 - 496.88] many days unless something changes so I
[495.00 - 499.64] wake up as precisely as that without an
[496.88 - 504.24] alarm Okay so I wake up at around that
[499.64 - 506.24] 550 is and then um yeah I just love to
[504.24 - 507.88] see the sun watch the sunrise and I'm
[506.24 - 511.00] lucky that from my home I can watch the
[507.88 - 513.44] sun literally come out of the Horizon so
[511.00 - 514.96] I stand there and watch the sunrise and
[513.44 - 517.56] then I have a dog I play with her for
[514.96 - 520.64] some time I have my little hot water
[517.56 - 523.68] with some dip in the morning I do that I
[520.64 - 526.20] have my thyroid medication and yeah so
[523.68 - 528.64] the daily chores of the morning I I like
[526.20 - 530.56] to do my temple little Temple where I
[528.64 - 532.32] put the flower and the flow all of that
[530.56 - 534.52] I like to water my own little garden
[532.32 - 536.68] whatever little we have in Bombay so I
[534.52 - 538.24] do all of that and by 8 I'm on my
[536.68 - 540.04] computer desk where I finish off my
[538.24 - 542.16] emails blah blah all of that
[540.04 - 543.44] because I lecture a lot globally there
[542.16 - 544.96] is something or the other lecture that I
[543.44 - 547.28] need to prepare so I'm preparing in the
[544.96 - 549.84] morning that's it 9 I'm getting ready
[547.28 - 553.16] 9:45 I'm out to the
[549.84 - 556.44] clinic then we see anywhere between our
[553.16 - 558.68] 40 to 45 patients every day so it's a
[556.44 - 561.56] continuous and I am very particular
[558.68 - 564.20] about seeing every patient myself we did
[561.56 - 566.76] have Junior doctors earlier dmats to
[564.20 - 569.72] take the initial history do a few things
[566.76 - 572.56] but somehow I thought unless I ga the
[569.72 - 575.52] history myself something is missing so
[572.56 - 577.36] tell me something for the uninitiated
[575.52 - 579.12] out there who everyone wants to look
[577.36 - 582.24] beautiful today wants to have great skin
[579.12 - 584.04] the skin is the largest organ yeah when
[582.24 - 586.76] there are two types of ways to look at
[584.04 - 588.96] it one is I've got a problem like I had
[586.76 - 590.76] adult acne all my life so I got a
[588.96 - 593.12] problem fair enough but you have clear
[590.76 - 594.92] skin yeah so I'm assuming that when
[593.12 - 598.36] you're 25 years of
[594.92 - 600.20] age what would be the reason for you to
[598.36 - 601.44] go and meet Ault matologist from a
[600.20 - 603.92] maintenance point of view so let's
[601.44 - 607.60] divide it into two parts right one part
[603.92 - 609.48] is the prevention the preventive um
[607.60 - 611.04] servicing that we can do and then
[609.48 - 614.20] there's something which is there's a
[611.04 - 616.52] problem yeah so what's your take on what
[614.20 - 618.60] age should we start looking at
[616.52 - 619.84] prevention yeah uh what are the things
[618.60 - 621.40] that we need to do in prevention and
[619.84 - 623.72] then we'll go into the people who have
[621.40 - 625.28] got cudas like me on my face and we we
[623.72 - 627.96] have dermatologists on speed dialing
[625.28 - 629.76] like what can I do doctor I do okay so
[627.96 - 631.48] by and large I keep telling patients
[629.76 - 633.08] when you go to a doctor or even look at
[631.48 - 635.84] your own skin and plan what you want to
[633.08 - 639.60] do two main things like you necessarily
[635.84 - 642.36] said skin problem and skin goal skin
[639.60 - 644.36] goal goal okay yeah so you may have like
[642.36 - 646.16] you said I have smooth skin but my skin
[644.36 - 648.64] goal at this age is to maintain my
[646.16 - 651.52] hydration and make my skin look as
[648.64 - 653.44] youthful mhm as I would like it to be so
[651.52 - 656.24] that's my skin goal for the longest time
[653.44 - 658.40] mhm and maybe prevent pigmentation at
[656.24 - 661.52] this time in my life so these are my
[658.40 - 663.56] skin goals but what are my skin V or
[661.52 - 666.84] problems is the other thing that I want
[663.56 - 670.28] to deal with um I have an itchy eye
[666.84 - 671.44] sometimes so I want to prevent that
[670.28 - 673.20] around the eye because I don't want
[671.44 - 675.44] crinkly eye coming and when when an
[673.20 - 677.76] itchy eye is there and you scratch it
[675.44 - 679.84] the BL capillaries around the ey so
[677.76 - 681.72] delicate when you do this it kind of
[679.84 - 684.80] breaks and it may add to your dark
[681.72 - 686.64] Circle A lot of times it's justop I was
[684.80 - 689.72] about to ask you about dark circles just
[686.64 - 691.04] allergy at Toopy so-called hay fever
[689.72 - 693.84] what we call you know
[691.04 - 696.76] sensitization atopic dysis you call so
[693.84 - 698.48] all of these come under a category where
[696.76 - 701.48] you can have early morning sneezing
[698.48 - 704.00] itchy eye itchy nose and you end up
[701.48 - 706.36] doing this to your eye you're disrupting
[704.00 - 708.44] and Breaking All the capillaries and it
[706.36 - 710.20] leaks the blood and what happens to all
[708.44 - 712.28] that hemosiderin or the pigment in the
[710.20 - 714.76] blood it just sits there between the
[712.28 - 717.24] tissue and as you grow older your
[714.76 - 719.24] lymphatic drainage from this area
[717.24 - 720.80] becomes poorer and poorer what is lym
[719.24 - 723.76] lymphatic
[720.80 - 726.32] drainage so lymphatic drain so there is
[723.76 - 728.04] blood vessels mhm there is artery which
[726.32 - 729.80] gets the good blood from the heart to
[728.04 - 731.88] the rest of your body to function the to
[729.80 - 733.84] pull it back is I studied I stud a
[731.88 - 736.52] little B fantastic so way to pull it all
[733.84 - 738.48] back for the main fact call a bad blood
[736.52 - 741.28] correct and it'll clean it up and it'll
[738.48 - 743.48] send it back again from the from the
[741.28 - 745.96] lungs and then heart will pump it
[743.48 - 748.84] everywhere else correct now there is one
[745.96 - 751.48] more thing which adds so all this blood
[748.84 - 754.28] vessels whether it is vein or artery can
[751.48 - 756.84] leak away somewhere a little and some
[754.28 - 758.40] fluid can be just sitting in your tissue
[756.84 - 760.60] micro leaks it's not that blood is
[758.40 - 762.72] leaking some serum leaks away there is
[760.60 - 765.88] leak from the let's say gut here there
[762.72 - 768.04] everywhere so that leaky fluid which is
[765.88 - 770.76] there sometimes simply inflammation will
[768.04 - 772.88] bring in fluid to a tissue all of this
[770.76 - 775.28] will be sitting there and they will also
[772.88 - 778.64] be pulled by other channels which are
[775.28 - 780.36] lymphatic channels lymph is a fluid now
[778.64 - 782.44] that is then taken out so if you see a
[780.36 - 784.96] lot of massure they'll tell you
[782.44 - 786.40] lymphatic drainage so they will say you
[784.96 - 787.80] massage from here and then massage from
[786.40 - 789.52] here but they have to be really good at
[787.80 - 791.08] that P they will have to be really good
[789.52 - 793.24] at that they have to know the anatomy of
[791.08 - 794.80] the other it could damage your skin yeah
[793.24 - 796.84] you should know which direction you
[794.80 - 799.32] should know where your lymphatic lymph
[796.84 - 802.16] nodes are is this why it's better to
[799.32 - 804.88] take a face massage at a Dermatology
[802.16 - 806.76] Clinic rather than one of these Spas
[804.88 - 809.44] where that person like like rubbing your
[806.76 - 812.16] face and going at it very hard yeah but
[809.44 - 814.12] I must also say in their defense today
[812.16 - 816.68] if you see the curriculum of a
[814.12 - 818.56] legitimate Spa therapist or a massure
[816.68 - 821.32] they trained they yeah they go through
[818.56 - 823.76] some I think noway a lot of Spas have
[821.32 - 826.08] dermatologists as part of the team and
[823.76 - 827.92] everything yeah that is a slightly
[826.08 - 830.12] controversial topic whether we should be
[827.92 - 832.84] included in a spa spa should be included
[830.12 - 835.96] in a Dermatology Center all this is now
[832.84 - 838.52] getting very merging but you need to be
[835.96 - 842.16] if you give ADV if you to give advice to
[838.52 - 844.28] me M and say that um okay doc I want to
[842.16 - 846.44] go to a spa but I want to be going to a
[844.28 - 850.48] spa when the people are good doc I want
[846.44 - 853.72] to go to uh Dermatology Clinic to maybe
[850.48 - 856.20] prevent pigmentation acne uh look
[853.72 - 857.80] younger what should I be looking for in
[856.20 - 860.12] the Dermatology Clinic and what should
[857.80 - 862.64] be looking for in the spa as per your
[860.12 - 864.96] expertise thank you for this question
[862.64 - 868.04] because I've had recently a patient who
[864.96 - 869.72] came back with severe complications
[868.04 - 873.76] after getting
[869.72 - 876.56] an IV drip from a
[873.76 - 879.32] salon yeah and I have another patient
[876.56 - 882.52] who came back to me a few months ago who
[879.32 - 884.44] came with severe facial irritation not
[882.52 - 886.96] just irritation she ended up actually
[884.44 - 889.60] having a slight little nerve damage
[886.96 - 893.36] after doing an equipment energy based
[889.60 - 895.20] equipment in a salon so she says I was
[893.36 - 897.60] sitting doing my pedicure this oh you're
[895.20 - 899.04] doing a pedicure let's just run a drip
[897.60 - 901.44] or you're doing a manicure let's just
[899.04 - 902.60] just finish off your some hu or some RF
[901.44 - 905.92] on the
[902.60 - 909.24] face so please don't do these things
[905.92 - 911.40] because as easy as these equipments look
[909.24 - 914.36] one it's very difficult for you as a lay
[911.40 - 917.72] man to say if the equipment firstly is
[914.36 - 919.48] legitimate or not so there is an us FDA
[917.72 - 922.24] there is a European FDA which is called
[919.48 - 923.92] a c Mark there is a Korean FDA there is
[922.24 - 927.16] an Indian every company of course has
[923.92 - 929.56] their own FDA for the tool us FDA is the
[927.16 - 932.00] most stringent for the unin ated out
[929.56 - 934.20] there what does FDA mean Food and Drug
[932.00 - 936.12] Administration correct I was thinking
[934.20 - 938.16] for a second suddenly yeah because Food
[936.12 - 939.44] and Drug Administration the tools also
[938.16 - 941.04] go through the same that's what I was
[939.44 - 942.76] about to ask you is it only the medicine
[941.04 - 944.80] or is it the tools also the medical
[942.76 - 947.36] tools also go go through this so if
[944.80 - 949.32] you're buying equipment for your clinic
[947.36 - 951.96] you're looking for that as a doctor but
[949.32 - 953.72] as a as a lay man I would not know what
[951.96 - 955.72] that equipment would be and today the
[953.72 - 957.64] equipment manufacturers the MEO or the
[955.72 - 960.04] copy equipment manufacturers have become
[957.64 - 962.76] so brilliant they make the outer body
[960.04 - 965.24] look exactly like the original machine
[962.76 - 966.76] and the name there will be slightly
[965.24 - 968.36] different where you can't even make out
[966.76 - 970.76] that what is different if you if you
[968.36 - 973.12] really don't know so the whole point
[970.76 - 974.64] first is when you go when you're looking
[973.12 - 976.12] at anything there are three four things
[974.64 - 977.32] you need to do one look at the doctor
[976.12 - 980.04] and know that know what her
[977.32 - 982.64] qualifications are so do do you think
[980.04 - 985.32] it's right like I remember I took my dad
[982.64 - 987.44] to a doctor and I said doctor if you
[985.32 - 990.36] don't mind may I know your
[987.44 - 992.28] qualifications that's does a patient can
[990.36 - 995.04] a patient ask the doctor birth right
[992.28 - 996.96] your Birthright to do that like a so
[995.04 - 999.88] this one very sweet patient from a small
[996.96 - 1001.80] town came in and uh you know how I
[999.88 - 1003.96] always get these teenagers or these 20
[1001.80 - 1006.48] something and the parents with them mhm
[1003.96 - 1008.48] and uh I can see this Dynamics because I
[1006.48 - 1010.68] have a 20 something at home so it's like
[1008.48 - 1013.16] always mother talks father talks like
[1010.68 - 1015.28] come on come on come on we be happening
[1013.16 - 1016.96] okay so like don't embarrass us come on
[1015.28 - 1018.08] we'll be happening so here the same
[1016.96 - 1019.56] thing happens that mother will be
[1018.08 - 1021.52] complaining something
[1019.56 - 1023.24] the children will have eyes open wide
[1021.52 - 1024.96] whatever our parents we be dis our
[1023.24 - 1026.16] parents kind come on come on we be
[1024.96 - 1027.80] happen what happened in this inci so
[1026.16 - 1030.88] that parent
[1027.80 - 1033.72] said I want to know your degree it was
[1030.88 - 1035.44] so sweet I was like I'm so glad you're
[1033.72 - 1036.80] doing this and child was like come on
[1035.44 - 1039.08] what's Happening like you can't ask a
[1036.80 - 1040.72] doctor this I'm like no you must and
[1039.08 - 1042.68] more people should ask what is the
[1040.72 - 1043.88] qualification of the doctor because it
[1042.68 - 1046.20] is very
[1043.88 - 1048.12] important what you may think is just an
[1046.20 - 1049.80] acne cream or what you may think is just
[1048.12 - 1051.88] a small laser
[1049.80 - 1054.24] may actually cause a lot of harm if
[1051.88 - 1056.28] you're not done in the right way
[1054.24 - 1058.00] medicines today especially in India
[1056.28 - 1059.68] everything is aaable OTC and everyone's
[1058.00 - 1061.80] self-prescribing right yeah because
[1059.68 - 1064.36] everything is available OTC and there
[1061.80 - 1066.96] are so many so-called skincare experts
[1064.36 - 1069.48] on the wide space of I want to talk to
[1066.96 - 1071.64] you about this now I mean we are experts
[1069.48 - 1074.36] but then I always tell my team doctors
[1071.64 - 1076.88] are the true experts they are qualified
[1074.36 - 1078.28] they're not certified yeah all these
[1076.88 - 1080.00] influencers are certified and they're
[1078.28 - 1081.56] doing these in Instagram videos and all
[1080.00 - 1083.00] what certification also we don't know
[1081.56 - 1084.64] that is never mind so so coming back to
[1083.00 - 1087.12] the clinic the lady asked you about your
[1084.64 - 1089.16] qualifications so I very happy I so I
[1087.12 - 1090.48] was I want to say that I ended up of
[1089.16 - 1094.00] course explaining to them this this this
[1090.48 - 1095.80] is my qualification so I want everyone
[1094.00 - 1098.44] to be able to ask their doctors and
[1095.80 - 1100.60] don't shy away from it what is it so if
[1098.44 - 1104.56] you're going in for let's say a hair
[1100.60 - 1108.12] removal laser or simply a Botox a filler
[1104.56 - 1109.40] a peel a facial you could maybe also go
[1108.12 - 1112.20] now I don't know is going to troll me
[1109.40 - 1114.60] for this but you could end up going in
[1112.20 - 1116.48] for an mbbs Doctor Who's called as an
[1114.60 - 1118.24] aesthetic physician or a cosmetic
[1116.48 - 1120.84] physician aesthetic physician or a
[1118.24 - 1123.80] cosmetic physician that physician is the
[1120.84 - 1125.20] stressful stressing term here now there
[1123.80 - 1127.32] also you need to make sure there are a
[1125.20 - 1129.76] lot of doctors who are not from
[1127.32 - 1132.76] mbbs could be a BHMs or could be
[1129.76 - 1135.16] something else which cannot be
[1132.76 - 1137.28] prescribing you certain medicines so you
[1135.16 - 1139.64] need to be very careful when you say
[1137.28 - 1141.40] mbbs doctors they are Bor so it's not
[1139.64 - 1143.68] that they don't know any one thing we
[1141.40 - 1145.76] also have a small little Dermatology
[1143.68 - 1147.28] posting but you're not a master of
[1145.76 - 1149.28] Dermatology who would you recruit into
[1147.28 - 1152.20] your clinic you are a global speaker
[1149.28 - 1154.20] teacher you have your own Clinic yeah
[1152.20 - 1155.72] who would you recruit into your clinic
[1154.20 - 1157.64] because then I know that Dr Rashi is
[1155.72 - 1159.96] recruiting the right person so that's
[1157.64 - 1162.32] the doctor to be going to yeah so I
[1159.96 - 1165.56] would only recruit A specialized
[1162.32 - 1168.92] dermatologist that's number one mhm um
[1165.56 - 1171.28] two in my hydrobat clinic I did have one
[1168.92 - 1173.12] of the doctors who are mbbs because
[1171.28 - 1175.28] there are times that an like I said
[1173.12 - 1177.76] there are certain things an mbbs can do
[1175.28 - 1179.32] under a guidance of a derat they're just
[1177.76 - 1182.20] Physicians they're Physicians so they're
[1179.32 - 1184.92] still mbbs they are not non-physicians
[1182.20 - 1187.56] so they are not a BHMs which is a
[1184.92 - 1189.68] homeopath or an ayurveda doctor they are
[1187.56 - 1191.20] best at what they are taught they can't
[1189.68 - 1192.80] be prescribing English medicine because
[1191.20 - 1195.00] that's not the training they go through
[1192.80 - 1197.88] simple they're equally fabulous doctors
[1195.00 - 1199.48] in their stream not in an other stream
[1197.88 - 1200.68] it's like would you want to come to me
[1199.48 - 1202.56] for
[1200.68 - 1204.16] Homeopathy obviously that's that's a
[1202.56 - 1206.88] nice way to put it that's all so it's
[1204.16 - 1209.64] like you specialized in as much as I'm
[1206.88 - 1211.16] an ayurveda Enthusiast and I'm a South
[1209.64 - 1214.80] Indian grown up my grandfather was an
[1211.16 - 1217.52] ayurveda Pandit I can't prescribe Aura
[1214.80 - 1219.68] that's not what I'm trained with so you
[1217.52 - 1222.24] end up doing either an mbbs I would
[1219.68 - 1224.40] recruit or then I would recruit a
[1222.24 - 1226.08] dermatologist now so if you're an mbbs
[1224.40 - 1228.68] you could do all this then you need to
[1226.08 - 1232.24] go to a dermatologist if you're having
[1228.68 - 1234.88] serious issues certain pigmentation hair
[1232.24 - 1237.20] loss acne these are all things which you
[1234.88 - 1239.48] need a though it sounds aesthetic you
[1237.20 - 1241.92] need a specialized dermatologist means
[1239.48 - 1243.24] looking beautiful correct so it could be
[1241.92 - 1246.80] anyone from a beautician is an
[1243.24 - 1249.00] aesthetician M uh Spa therapist is an
[1246.80 - 1251.36] aesthetician technicians in your office
[1249.00 - 1254.92] is aesthetic technicians so these are
[1251.36 - 1258.76] all people who are ancillary services in
[1254.92 - 1261.36] Aesthetics whose main goal is to
[1258.76 - 1263.36] get you the outcome of looking your best
[1261.36 - 1266.60] has time changed now wherein more and
[1263.36 - 1268.16] more people are are are taking care of
[1266.60 - 1270.48] themselves from an aesthetic point of
[1268.16 - 1272.00] view yeah as compared to maybe a
[1270.48 - 1274.92] clinical
[1272.00 - 1277.08] issue yeah so it or does that Define you
[1274.92 - 1278.84] as a doctor like I'm going to do
[1277.08 - 1280.60] clinical practice or I'm going to do
[1278.84 - 1282.56] aesthetic practice a lot of people ended
[1280.60 - 1284.64] up thinking initially I'm a clinical
[1282.56 - 1286.00] dermatologist and L sometimes even look
[1284.64 - 1289.24] down upon aesthetic
[1286.00 - 1291.48] dermatologists but to me today everybody
[1289.24 - 1293.40] has understood aesthetic Dermatology is
[1291.48 - 1296.28] nothing but an extension of a clinical
[1293.40 - 1299.20] Dermatology for example how I look at my
[1296.28 - 1301.76] patients differently and why I have a
[1299.20 - 1303.36] certain practice and certain kind of
[1301.76 - 1305.28] patients who come to me who are much
[1303.36 - 1307.40] more aware and enlightened about
[1305.28 - 1308.92] skincare is because if you come to me
[1307.40 - 1310.84] with a pigmentation I am not just
[1308.92 - 1312.60] looking at your pigment we are looking
[1310.84 - 1313.76] at the health of the skin the cause of
[1312.60 - 1316.16] the
[1313.76 - 1318.16] pigment it could be anything for example
[1316.16 - 1320.16] if you come with a patch on the skin it
[1318.16 - 1322.16] is not necessarily every time that it is
[1320.16 - 1324.00] melasma which is the most commonly
[1322.16 - 1326.32] understood thing right so it's not
[1324.00 - 1329.32] necessarily melasma it sometimes could
[1326.32 - 1332.60] be a initiation of a horis Nei a small
[1329.32 - 1334.64] little thing it could be um acanthosis
[1332.60 - 1337.84] on the face it could be frictional
[1334.64 - 1340.88] melanosis on the face it could be lpp on
[1337.84 - 1343.08] the face variant and ashid dermatosis on
[1340.88 - 1345.32] the face it could be any of this so when
[1343.08 - 1346.92] you go to a dermatologist they are able
[1345.32 - 1350.48] to firstly
[1346.92 - 1353.32] diagnose what is the pigmentation H what
[1350.48 - 1355.64] is the origin of it iology of it which
[1353.32 - 1357.68] layer is the pigment there which
[1355.64 - 1360.20] condition is in both the layers which is
[1357.68 - 1362.72] in one layer all of this accordingly the
[1360.20 - 1365.08] treatment can be chosen otherwise you
[1362.72 - 1367.32] may have a popular laser but you may
[1365.08 - 1371.56] just be firing in the wrong energies and
[1367.32 - 1375.28] the wrong wrong place so this is why
[1371.56 - 1379.04] it's important to go to a legitimate
[1375.28 - 1381.24] dermatologist and a person who is like
[1379.04 - 1384.00] Mo the other day someone ended up saying
[1381.24 - 1385.68] that yeah every dermatologist can be a
[1384.00 - 1389.36] hair transplant
[1385.68 - 1391.80] surgeon mhm but you can't necessarily
[1389.36 - 1393.84] claim so which means to say that if you
[1391.80 - 1396.40] want to do a hair transplant surgery a
[1393.84 - 1398.56] dermatologist is qualified to do that
[1396.40 - 1400.92] but none of us or most of us don't have
[1398.56 - 1402.72] the training in our College days or in
[1400.92 - 1404.36] your postgraduation days you have to go
[1402.72 - 1406.44] and super specialize in that exactly
[1404.36 - 1408.56] there's no super specialization degree
[1406.44 - 1410.88] but you have to go and work under
[1408.56 - 1414.00] someone train under someone for years to
[1410.88 - 1417.08] be a specialist hair transplant person
[1414.00 - 1419.44] MH so then you go to them for that
[1417.08 - 1422.12] likewise maybe for a Botox a filler for
[1419.44 - 1424.04] anti-aging for equipment devices some of
[1422.12 - 1425.60] us had that interest and specialized in
[1424.04 - 1428.24] it right from the
[1425.60 - 1430.84] beginning so all dermatologists may not
[1428.24 - 1433.04] be that great in doing anti-aging
[1430.84 - 1435.24] treatments I take pride in doing that
[1433.04 - 1437.08] because I've always loved it speaking of
[1435.24 - 1439.32] anti-aging my antennas went up the
[1437.08 - 1442.40] moment you use the word Botox
[1439.32 - 1444.72] okay and um all of us want to look
[1442.40 - 1446.64] younger yeah even as men today want to
[1444.72 - 1449.88] look younger why not what is a
[1446.64 - 1451.96] difference between Botox and filler my
[1449.88 - 1454.00] God I thought this question has been
[1451.96 - 1455.32] understood but I see people asking even
[1454.00 - 1457.60] now this question most people haven't
[1455.32 - 1460.00] understood it so simple I don't know the
[1457.60 - 1462.20] difference I do yeah so it's simple so
[1460.00 - 1464.04] basically I know Botox is some enzyme or
[1462.20 - 1467.64] some poison you put in and the musle
[1464.04 - 1470.36] muscles Freeze from the B for no this is
[1467.64 - 1470.36] this is my Mone
[1470.72 - 1478.00] initiated okay so what is a Botox and so
[1474.24 - 1480.00] Botox basically just put simply Botox is
[1478.00 - 1481.56] a powder that we turn it into liquid
[1480.00 - 1483.60] from a little bottle pull it out and
[1481.56 - 1485.28] inject into you filler is more like a
[1483.60 - 1488.40] transparent jelly which we pull it out
[1485.28 - 1491.08] and inject into you simple now what does
[1488.40 - 1494.40] Botox do it let's say for a simple man's
[1491.08 - 1496.08] term it eases your expression lines
[1494.40 - 1498.72] which means to say if I have a line when
[1496.08 - 1500.92] I frown I use a Botox if I have these
[1498.72 - 1503.76] lines when I raise my brow up I use a
[1500.92 - 1507.00] Botox you smile and I have cross feet I
[1503.76 - 1509.60] use a Botox while if I have a line here
[1507.00 - 1512.12] which is sitting there etched right it
[1509.60 - 1513.96] is not because I'm moving it is sitting
[1512.12 - 1517.32] there so that I will fill in with a
[1513.96 - 1520.08] filler so filler is an inert substance
[1517.32 - 1522.48] like a clay which I'm putting in and it
[1520.08 - 1524.32] is sitting there if I want a cheekbone
[1522.48 - 1526.72] I'm putting in it is sitting there if I
[1524.32 - 1528.72] want to put give a cheekbone then I end
[1526.72 - 1531.24] up putting a little bit there mm if I
[1528.72 - 1533.44] want to put in a chin lip I'm putting in
[1531.24 - 1536.80] a filler basically anywhere where I want
[1533.44 - 1539.08] to mold is where I use a filler filler
[1536.80 - 1541.24] okay now how do they act filler like I
[1539.08 - 1544.76] said is simply inert goes in and sits
[1541.24 - 1548.36] where I put therefore I I I always say
[1544.76 - 1550.92] filler is a job of an artist you master
[1548.36 - 1553.52] the science you get your Anatomy right
[1550.92 - 1555.68] you know your product right how then you
[1553.52 - 1559.04] put these two together to create a
[1555.68 - 1561.84] beautiful face yeah to create a
[1559.04 - 1564.04] beautiful face is in the hand of the
[1561.84 - 1566.64] artist not the tool you may have picked
[1564.04 - 1570.12] the right tool then what do you do with
[1566.64 - 1571.68] the tool is why you need to go really do
[1570.12 - 1573.80] your research when you do the aesthetic
[1571.68 - 1576.56] treatments because the outcome is not
[1573.80 - 1579.36] mathematics can't be taught okay it
[1576.56 - 1581.28] can't be taught from a from a teacher to
[1579.36 - 1582.60] a pupil at all it's not painting by the
[1581.28 - 1584.24] numbers can be taught so there those are
[1582.60 - 1585.64] the basics but it's not the same
[1584.24 - 1587.56] template that you can put on everybody's
[1585.64 - 1589.76] face no you don't want to create masks
[1587.56 - 1591.88] so you are creating in bringing out the
[1589.76 - 1594.48] best correcting those little flaws
[1591.88 - 1596.32] enhancing the best features in the
[1594.48 - 1599.08] person that you're treating so therefore
[1596.32 - 1601.44] that's a huge art while a Botox can be
[1599.08 - 1604.40] equated to let's say painting by the
[1601.44 - 1606.76] numbers because if I decide what is a
[1604.40 - 1609.04] bulk of my muscle what is the extent of
[1606.76 - 1611.40] my muscle if I know where is the inter
[1609.04 - 1613.16] digitation with another muscle and I can
[1611.40 - 1616.20] calculate and say this many units these
[1613.16 - 1618.64] points and I'm done so if you know the
[1616.20 - 1620.44] anatomy really really well and you're
[1618.64 - 1623.64] able to mark it on the surface really
[1620.44 - 1626.08] really well then Botox is a simple thing
[1623.64 - 1629.68] how does Botox act when I inject that
[1626.08 - 1631.92] into it so the muscle sends a signal and
[1629.68 - 1633.88] when it says I'm angry you frown MH
[1631.92 - 1636.40] correct so the muscle said you're angry
[1633.88 - 1637.48] the muscle does not end up telling
[1636.40 - 1640.00] anything there's a nerve that's
[1637.48 - 1642.80] conducting now nerve comes and releases
[1640.00 - 1644.76] atile Coline atile Coline has a receptor
[1642.80 - 1646.84] in the muscle that is what muscle
[1644.76 - 1650.32] responds to and contracts so that's why
[1646.84 - 1654.16] you frown now if I negate the atile
[1650.32 - 1656.24] Coline from react responding the the
[1654.16 - 1658.24] receptor from responding to the atile
[1656.24 - 1659.88] Coline it won't respond I can keep
[1658.24 - 1663.64] saying I'm angry but this will say I'm
[1659.88 - 1666.20] happy I'm calm so that is why Botox is
[1663.64 - 1668.20] also looked upon as an anti-depressant
[1666.20 - 1669.72] do you know that yeah it makes makes
[1668.20 - 1671.64] sense there there's a scientific paper
[1669.72 - 1672.84] which says yes because you look into the
[1671.64 - 1675.08] mirror every morning and you're not
[1672.84 - 1677.64] drowning you're looking happy so mind
[1675.08 - 1679.88] says Ah I'm happy and it's like a
[1677.64 - 1681.88] feedback so that is why Botox is an
[1679.88 - 1685.32] antidepressent so basically it nullifies
[1681.88 - 1687.96] the signaling liquid from the nerve to
[1685.32 - 1689.84] the muscle so therefore the muscle
[1687.96 - 1690.80] action doesn't happen and the FR line
[1689.84 - 1693.68] doesn't
[1690.80 - 1696.56] form that is basic difference but
[1693.68 - 1698.12] there's a lot more we can do with botox
[1696.56 - 1699.92] where in we can narrow slim the face
[1698.12 - 1701.76] down slim the nostril down pick the tip
[1699.92 - 1704.24] of the nose up all these is very
[1701.76 - 1705.52] experienced injection techniques so
[1704.24 - 1707.16] there's so much more can be done but
[1705.52 - 1709.00] this is a basic difference so while a
[1707.16 - 1711.68] Botox wears off in in 3
[1709.00 - 1712.56] months oh btox actually wears off yeah
[1711.68 - 1715.12] yeah yeah Oh I thought it was a
[1712.56 - 1716.52] permanent procedure not at all not at
[1715.12 - 1717.88] all how would I then have my patients
[1716.52 - 1720.76] keep coming back to
[1717.88 - 1724.16] me so every 3 months you need to do the
[1720.76 - 1727.08] retouch up but while a filler goes in
[1724.16 - 1729.72] and stays textbook wise 6 months to a
[1727.08 - 1731.84] year but we have now seen in our own
[1729.72 - 1735.72] experiences that it stays for a long
[1731.84 - 1737.08] time so that one is a boon and a bane if
[1735.72 - 1738.76] it stays for a long time and it's a
[1737.08 - 1741.88] great job on the face you enjoy it for a
[1738.76 - 1743.60] long time if it's a bad job then you're
[1741.88 - 1746.28] also living with it for a long time so
[1743.60 - 1748.20] are there any risk to these fillers of
[1746.28 - 1750.60] oh yeah oh yeah and I think I think the
[1748.20 - 1753.04] risk would come in from going to the
[1750.60 - 1756.20] wrong person also so if you go to a
[1753.04 - 1758.48] completely unqualified untrained person
[1756.20 - 1760.68] major things can go wrong imagine you're
[1758.48 - 1762.08] actually doing things blind it's not
[1760.68 - 1764.12] like a surgeon you're opening up and
[1762.08 - 1765.52] doing right so I don't have a vision of
[1764.12 - 1766.92] oh this is the artery this is the nerve
[1765.52 - 1768.68] let me avoid this let me do this and let
[1766.92 - 1770.72] me cut here and let me cut here I'm
[1768.68 - 1774.28] doing it on a face with the envelope
[1770.72 - 1776.56] intact mhm so I'm going through it so I
[1774.28 - 1779.72] need to know my anatomy like the back of
[1776.56 - 1781.28] my hand I need to do multiple CER
[1779.72 - 1783.64] dissections which I keep even now
[1781.28 - 1786.72] indulging in to make sure my anatomy is
[1783.64 - 1789.16] refreshed and as we are growing older
[1786.72 - 1791.32] there are so many more newer papers
[1789.16 - 1793.36] coming up in anatomy where more
[1791.32 - 1795.36] dissections are done in the face with a
[1793.36 - 1797.24] different lens now right because they're
[1795.36 - 1799.88] viewing the anatomist also are viewing
[1797.24 - 1801.20] the face not just with a simple lens but
[1799.88 - 1803.00] saying oh my God these are the newer
[1801.20 - 1804.68] procedures that the doctors are doing so
[1803.00 - 1807.04] let me look at it more closely look at
[1804.68 - 1809.68] it more differently so we now know every
[1807.04 - 1812.40] plane what's happening any deviation in
[1809.68 - 1814.12] arteries what are the percentage of
[1812.40 - 1816.16] people with the same artery going in the
[1814.12 - 1818.12] same place so you need to know your
[1816.16 - 1820.84] anatomy and the tissue reaction very
[1818.12 - 1823.52] well if not you could actually go
[1820.84 - 1826.20] blind you could actually have a tissue
[1823.52 - 1829.72] dep you could have a entire nose
[1826.20 - 1831.28] literally falling off so we've had cases
[1829.72 - 1833.24] such as this around the world not much
[1831.28 - 1836.00] in India or at least it doesn't come out
[1833.24 - 1838.12] much but uh there's a lot of very scary
[1836.00 - 1839.68] things that can happen with filler
[1838.12 - 1841.36] whatever happens with botox usually
[1839.68 - 1844.24] recovers because like I said it wears
[1841.36 - 1846.60] off mhm whatever happens with fillers
[1844.24 - 1848.20] also mostly recovers because the face is
[1846.60 - 1851.12] such a wonderful organ there's so much
[1848.20 - 1853.40] blood supply so kind of recovers but
[1851.12 - 1855.44] blindness is
[1853.40 - 1857.64] irreparable I'm just seeing you sitting
[1855.44 - 1859.68] in your clinic and if somebody walks in
[1857.64 - 1861.32] you probably able to within about 30
[1859.68 - 1862.84] seconds say whether this person has had
[1861.32 - 1864.40] some treatment or not to their face yeah
[1862.84 - 1865.60] yeah instantly and they'll sometimes
[1864.40 - 1867.32] they'll sit and say oh I've done nothing
[1865.60 - 1869.80] to my face and I will know exactly then
[1867.32 - 1871.00] I'll I'll put my P pen on paper and say
[1869.80 - 1873.16] this this this this you've done your
[1871.00 - 1874.44] fill out they're like no but that was 5
[1873.16 - 1875.52] years ago I said but you have done right
[1874.44 - 1879.56] when I ask you history you should have
[1875.52 - 1882.44] told me that so I can just see exactly
[1879.56 - 1884.08] so there are a lot of myths about skin
[1882.44 - 1885.96] care there are a lot of certified
[1884.08 - 1887.60] influencers that are there now today on
[1885.96 - 1889.20] Instagram which come and troll you and
[1887.60 - 1891.12] me and they think they know it
[1889.20 - 1892.36] everything they just have a camera and
[1891.12 - 1894.28] then they have a mic and then they're
[1892.36 - 1895.88] talking about as if they know the world
[1894.28 - 1898.68] but they don't have a clinical practice
[1895.88 - 1901.28] scary what are some of the common myths
[1898.68 - 1903.28] that are out there or Hocus Pocus stuff
[1901.28 - 1907.04] that makes your blood boil when you hear
[1903.28 - 1909.24] about it see today I should say the
[1907.04 - 1911.00] bloggers also read up a lot so they
[1909.24 - 1912.52] sound intelligent and they tell you the
[1911.00 - 1914.56] right things so they may not be much
[1912.52 - 1915.84] depth if you really to to sound
[1914.56 - 1917.36] intelligent but you don't have the
[1915.84 - 1919.52] clinical practice no depth and no
[1917.36 - 1921.12] clinical no degrees so that's something
[1919.52 - 1923.92] which you need to be very clear of who
[1921.12 - 1926.16] you're listening to or who you're who
[1923.92 - 1927.28] you're even as a completely qualified
[1926.16 - 1928.52] doctor there are a lot of times people
[1927.28 - 1931.12] get angry with me because I don't
[1928.52 - 1933.20] suggest a product but I can't how will I
[1931.12 - 1935.36] suggest a product online which one is
[1933.20 - 1936.60] the best sunscreen what kind of a
[1935.36 - 1938.12] question is that I can't tell you
[1936.60 - 1939.60] because I don't know your skin type I
[1938.12 - 1941.40] don't know your sun exposure I don't
[1939.60 - 1944.00] know where you live Ryan Fernando can
[1941.40 - 1945.24] you recommend a diet plan yeah hello I
[1944.00 - 1946.40] don't know your gender I don't know your
[1945.24 - 1947.60] age I don't know your body fat
[1946.40 - 1948.92] percentage and then I'm angry you only
[1947.60 - 1951.16] do it for celebrities you don't do it
[1948.92 - 1954.24] for me you can't do free for me I'm a
[1951.16 - 1956.40] poor person and everything so the same
[1954.24 - 1957.48] same page and then something I would
[1956.40 - 1960.52] have applied they'll say which one are
[1957.48 - 1962.60] you applying but that's for my skin so
[1960.52 - 1965.16] like that what boils me is when people
[1962.60 - 1967.80] end up coming online is bioindividual
[1965.16 - 1969.20] very very so one person could use a
[1967.80 - 1971.00] sunscreen and another person could use a
[1969.20 - 1973.36] sunscreen and they could have two
[1971.00 - 1974.92] different effects on the SK yes so even
[1973.36 - 1976.44] you're like looking at the skin and
[1974.92 - 1979.00] saying okay you can't use this sunscreen
[1976.44 - 1982.44] you got to use this sunscreen yeah yeah
[1979.00 - 1984.08] ah I just thought it was SPF SPF is a
[1982.44 - 1985.92] general thing there are many factors
[1984.08 - 1986.92] that you see in a sunscreen SPF is one
[1985.92 - 1988.12] tell us a little bit about it because
[1986.92 - 1989.64] you got a lot of sun it's going to it's
[1988.12 - 1991.72] only going to get hotter heat wave is
[1989.64 - 1995.52] coming up heat wave is coming up
[1991.72 - 1998.80] so right from the kids to older people
[1995.52 - 2000.80] talk to us about skin care routine um
[1998.80 - 2002.56] you know the free tips to everyone out
[2000.80 - 2005.24] there who's listening in we got Dr
[2002.56 - 2007.92] Rashmi in here to me she's this she's
[2005.24 - 2009.24] the verat kohi of Dermatology so like
[2007.92 - 2011.12] hitting everything out of the pot let's
[2009.24 - 2012.68] get some free tips from us what what
[2011.12 - 2014.40] would you recommend from a skincare
[2012.68 - 2018.00] routine point of view I remember her
[2014.40 - 2020.72] hearing ctm yeah cleans when started off
[2018.00 - 2022.68] in life yeah CM but I'm too lazy to do
[2020.72 - 2025.68] it so where would you take skincare
[2022.68 - 2029.16] routine for all of us so like you said
[2025.68 - 2031.44] the first thing for skin is hygiene I
[2029.16 - 2034.16] would start right from there so your
[2031.44 - 2036.80] scalp hygiene is included in skin
[2034.16 - 2038.52] hygiene so very very important so you
[2036.80 - 2041.28] need to have a clean a lot of times
[2038.52 - 2042.92] teenagers come to me with acne and these
[2041.28 - 2045.44] days teenagers are so paranoid about
[2042.92 - 2047.32] losing their hair mhm there's also early
[2045.44 - 2049.20] graying early balding that we see right
[2047.32 - 2051.56] so they are all oh yeah big time as
[2049.20 - 2054.32] compared to like 10 years ago this is
[2051.56 - 2056.28] huge right now so therefore they're
[2054.32 - 2058.80] scared to wash their hair they think
[2056.28 - 2061.28] washing hair leads to hair fall which is
[2058.80 - 2064.24] a big myth not at all keep your scalp
[2061.28 - 2068.08] clean say that again from me washing
[2064.24 - 2070.76] hair will not lead to hairall at all in
[2068.08 - 2073.64] fact accumulation of your dandruff your
[2070.76 - 2077.12] sebum your dirt on your scalp will lead
[2073.64 - 2081.04] to inflammation which leads to hair
[2077.12 - 2083.20] fall that's a sixer right now yeah
[2081.04 - 2084.76] because everyone's saying today I don't
[2083.20 - 2087.04] wash my hair don't wash your hair and
[2084.76 - 2089.00] everything no not the doctor says you
[2087.04 - 2093.52] got to wash your hair but how do we do
[2089.00 - 2097.36] it yes so depends on scalp type okay so
[2093.52 - 2099.04] if you have a very dry scalp how do you
[2097.36 - 2101.28] know the difference between dry scalp
[2099.04 - 2103.56] and and dandruff is my NE is your next
[2101.28 - 2105.24] question so I'm preempting it so if you
[2103.56 - 2107.92] have a dry scalp you will know that the
[2105.24 - 2109.68] day you wash your hair mhm immediately
[2107.92 - 2112.08] once you dry it it starts getting flaky
[2109.68 - 2114.72] it start getting itchy and a little
[2112.08 - 2116.40] sensitive um and then if someone kind of
[2114.72 - 2118.88] opens up your hair and sees the scalp it
[2116.40 - 2121.08] may feel a little red as well so now
[2118.88 - 2123.96] this you know is dry scalp
[2121.08 - 2126.40] flakiness so then you don't wash your
[2123.96 - 2129.08] hair every day you can wash it alternate
[2126.40 - 2131.20] day so that some oil accumulate there
[2129.08 - 2133.88] wait for it to kind of accumulate but if
[2131.20 - 2136.92] you have an oily scalp then you can wash
[2133.88 - 2139.84] your scalp every single day with your
[2136.92 - 2142.04] chosen shampoo now if you do have
[2139.84 - 2143.96] dandruff then again you need to wash it
[2142.04 - 2147.56] every single days you're not a
[2143.96 - 2150.16] letting the yeast and the fat of your
[2147.56 - 2151.52] skin which is with the skin of the scalp
[2150.16 - 2153.48] is putting out that's the food for the
[2151.52 - 2155.88] East so you're going to kill both so
[2153.48 - 2157.96] you're going to wash it off every day
[2155.88 - 2160.64] this is what you do now if if you have
[2157.96 - 2163.04] we only talking about scalp right now so
[2160.64 - 2164.84] if you have a scalp a certain way and a
[2163.04 - 2167.60] hair a certain way most people end up
[2164.84 - 2170.84] asking do my scalp scalp is oily but my
[2167.60 - 2173.60] hair is dry now what do I do so that's
[2170.84 - 2176.44] when you wash your scalp with the said
[2173.60 - 2179.08] shampoo every single day and you don't
[2176.44 - 2182.36] have to shampoo your hair at all hair is
[2179.08 - 2185.48] dry hair is not dirty we are all in AC
[2182.36 - 2187.60] closed environments so you wash your
[2185.48 - 2190.20] hair just so that you get some hydration
[2187.60 - 2192.00] and shine on it once in a week with the
[2190.20 - 2194.08] shampoo but you shampoo your scalp every
[2192.00 - 2196.52] day and put conditioner for the hair and
[2194.08 - 2198.52] come out of the bath so this is what you
[2196.52 - 2200.84] would wash your hair and your scalp
[2198.52 - 2203.60] separately anti- dander shampoo can only
[2200.84 - 2206.12] go on the scalp but a hydrating shampoo
[2203.60 - 2208.48] can go on your hair so that's how you
[2206.12 - 2210.72] look for hair and scalp shampoo so that
[2208.48 - 2212.60] is scalp hygiene now skin hygiene
[2210.72 - 2214.08] depends again on your skin type now
[2212.60 - 2216.80] whatever is your skin you're having a
[2214.08 - 2218.72] bath I prefer a liquid soap to a solid
[2216.80 - 2220.60] soap only because you don't keep pulling
[2218.72 - 2222.04] applying putting it back and again
[2220.60 - 2222.92] picking up applying putting it back
[2222.04 - 2226.08] what's the
[2222.92 - 2227.72] logic there is it's a soap right and
[2226.08 - 2229.24] you're touching it on your skin there
[2227.72 - 2231.00] could be germs there could be dust
[2229.24 - 2232.88] accumulating do we wash our soap before
[2231.00 - 2235.60] really using two three people might use
[2232.88 - 2237.20] the same thing in the house I just feel
[2235.60 - 2239.88] it is a
[2237.20 - 2242.00] little unhygienic concept about it
[2239.88 - 2245.60] though the whole world lives on bra
[2242.00 - 2247.16] going like yeah I feel uh personally
[2245.60 - 2248.80] it's it's it's not something that I want
[2247.16 - 2250.48] to touch tou put back touch put back so
[2248.80 - 2252.44] it's easy to take it out of a dispenser
[2250.48 - 2255.12] use it and you're done what is sitting
[2252.44 - 2257.40] inside is still untouched right true so
[2255.12 - 2260.28] true and if 10 people in a house use one
[2257.40 - 2262.48] bathroom for example not all 10 are
[2260.28 - 2264.56] using the same soap and putting it back
[2262.48 - 2266.28] so you still I'm the soap dishes sitting
[2264.56 - 2267.72] sometimes I've seen there'll be a soap
[2266.28 - 2270.60] dish there'll be a soap with a lot of
[2267.72 - 2272.48] water in it so nobody is even cleaning
[2270.60 - 2275.16] and emptying that so I find that whole
[2272.48 - 2276.88] thing a little unhygienic so it's easier
[2275.16 - 2277.96] for something coming out of a tube or a
[2276.88 - 2279.72] dispenser
[2277.96 - 2281.64] where you know what's inside is clean so
[2279.72 - 2283.76] that's the bathing ritual with bathing
[2281.64 - 2285.84] ritual and bathing how many times twice
[2283.76 - 2287.16] is okay more than that is not good for
[2285.84 - 2290.76] skin because you're ripping your own
[2287.16 - 2292.68] oils off I have a lot of athletes and
[2290.76 - 2295.20] they train like three four times a day
[2292.68 - 2298.52] wow okay so this has been my advice to
[2295.20 - 2301.52] them use the soap once a day on the
[2298.52 - 2303.76] entire body and in your private parts
[2301.52 - 2305.32] underarms and all all the body folds all
[2303.76 - 2308.20] the body folds you do that for body
[2305.32 - 2310.36] order and the that is two B and in
[2308.20 - 2312.40] thirdd or fourth just use plain water is
[2310.36 - 2314.72] that okay that's okay maybe if they're
[2312.40 - 2316.48] athletes you may still want them to use
[2314.72 - 2318.40] whatever little soaps even at their body
[2316.48 - 2320.56] folds each time they have a bath because
[2318.40 - 2324.08] they to sweat it out correct but other
[2320.56 - 2325.64] than that yeah soap only once okay
[2324.08 - 2327.88] awesome awesome is there any other
[2325.64 - 2330.60] skincare routine that we now get into
[2327.88 - 2332.40] Beyond bathing yeah so I think hygiene
[2330.60 - 2334.76] wise this is what that you need to be
[2332.40 - 2336.36] very careful about and washing the face
[2334.76 - 2338.12] would again be not more than two times
[2336.36 - 2340.64] if you really have an o oily skin then
[2338.12 - 2342.64] the third time I've seen a lot of people
[2340.64 - 2343.76] say oh but I'm just washing with water
[2342.64 - 2345.84] so this is this is something that I want
[2343.76 - 2347.88] to I want to share with you because I
[2345.84 - 2351.28] wrote a book called wheatless right and
[2347.88 - 2353.52] I had I had pimples my entire life and I
[2351.28 - 2355.40] as a teenager had this thought process
[2353.52 - 2357.44] if I washed my face more and I think
[2355.40 - 2359.72] many of you teenagers out there feel the
[2357.44 - 2361.44] same that I thought many years ago which
[2359.72 - 2363.64] is if I wash my face more I will not
[2361.44 - 2366.84] have more pimples so can you throw some
[2363.64 - 2371.20] light on this so by and large body works
[2366.84 - 2373.24] on a feed back mechanism mhm so mostly
[2371.20 - 2376.20] acne patients that when you say teenage
[2373.24 - 2378.44] boys have oily skin mhm you're washing
[2376.20 - 2380.40] the face off every time you feel oily
[2378.44 - 2383.28] even if you don't use a face wash you
[2380.40 - 2385.28] still making the skin dry what does the
[2383.28 - 2387.56] skin do when it is dry it says I'm used
[2385.28 - 2389.44] to a certain oiliness so skin is too dry
[2387.56 - 2391.48] let me throw out some more let me throw
[2389.44 - 2393.24] out some more so you're giving a wrong
[2391.48 - 2396.44] feedback where it is constantly throwing
[2393.24 - 2398.52] out more oil mhm so that is not at all
[2396.44 - 2400.80] happening my multiple times washing the
[2398.52 - 2403.72] face is only bad for you and if you're
[2400.80 - 2405.44] using multiple times face wash most acne
[2403.72 - 2407.68] patients have face wash which is either
[2405.44 - 2409.52] a salicylic acid based or a benzol
[2407.68 - 2411.96] peroxide acid based something even if
[2409.52 - 2413.64] it's a simple tea tree oil based to cut
[2411.96 - 2416.72] out the oil from the top that is an
[2413.64 - 2420.52] irritant also so how if the people are
[2416.72 - 2422.88] doing their own self skin care no so you
[2420.52 - 2424.96] end up washing your face with your said
[2422.88 - 2426.60] face wash not more than so sometimes
[2424.96 - 2429.68] these things actually be harming your
[2426.60 - 2431.44] skin very skin is a delicate barrier
[2429.68 - 2434.72] delicate barrier so so don't try and
[2431.44 - 2436.44] self fix it no not at all not at all and
[2434.72 - 2438.36] don't try doing anything to it if you
[2436.44 - 2440.08] don't want to don't keep touching it
[2438.36 - 2441.52] don't keep doing anything you see a lot
[2440.08 - 2443.24] of people sitting for an hour they have
[2441.52 - 2444.64] already touched the face 10 times yeah I
[2443.24 - 2446.96] have got a lot of kids who come into my
[2444.64 - 2449.16] nutrition counseling and they're like
[2446.96 - 2450.44] yeah yeah I'm like don't touch your face
[2449.16 - 2453.16] and they have already touched one 10
[2450.44 - 2456.08] places and come explain the logic why
[2453.16 - 2457.92] kids when studying when in school should
[2456.08 - 2460.40] not touch their face
[2457.92 - 2462.24] one because all hygiene like I keep
[2460.40 - 2463.40] saying going back to the hygiene rule
[2462.24 - 2464.72] you would have touched the railing of
[2463.40 - 2466.76] the steps because you have to skip on
[2464.72 - 2468.36] the step anden come down and then you
[2466.76 - 2469.64] touched your book that paper has God
[2468.36 - 2471.32] knows how many things absorbed and
[2469.64 - 2473.96] sitting on it how much dust might
[2471.32 - 2475.08] sitting on it and then your pencil your
[2473.96 - 2476.32] friend also would have bitten it you
[2475.08 - 2477.44] would have also bitten it that is also
[2476.32 - 2480.36] in your hand you would have touched this
[2477.44 - 2482.44] side that side bench table uniform Kaa
[2480.36 - 2485.28] everything is dirty your football your
[2482.44 - 2486.44] throwball everything shoelace all that
[2485.28 - 2489.84] and kids don't wash their hands in
[2486.44 - 2491.12] school all the shoelace everything and
[2489.84 - 2493.20] then you're sitting like this or you're
[2491.12 - 2495.16] touching your face or you're I am par I
[2493.20 - 2497.40] don't touch my face only if you see so
[2495.16 - 2500.00] even as an example I won't do this so
[2497.40 - 2502.52] you don't touch your face because there
[2500.00 - 2504.20] is there is so much in your I already
[2502.52 - 2505.44] did that five times in this podcast and
[2504.20 - 2506.44] that's why I told you even as an example
[2505.44 - 2508.40] I don't do this I'm going to fit like
[2506.44 - 2511.80] this in this podcast hands not on my
[2508.40 - 2513.68] face yes totally so that's very
[2511.80 - 2516.44] important for you to make sure that you
[2513.68 - 2518.16] don't keep touching your face that's a
[2516.44 - 2519.68] valid point that it's so valid we don't
[2518.16 - 2521.92] you know we don't teach the youngsters
[2519.68 - 2524.28] these things simple things simple things
[2521.92 - 2526.68] don't wash your face on hygiene so much
[2524.28 - 2529.52] wash your scalp don't wash your face too
[2526.68 - 2531.80] much don't touch your face at all these
[2529.52 - 2534.40] are a few things if you do also skin is
[2531.80 - 2536.36] good Dr Rashmi is it true that the face
[2534.40 - 2538.28] skin is the most sensitive skin in the
[2536.36 - 2540.40] human body or like needs that's only
[2538.28 - 2542.72] because it is exposed Like You cover
[2540.40 - 2544.80] everything up what is the most exposed
[2542.72 - 2546.32] all the time is this much no correct
[2544.80 - 2548.56] even if you cover the neck this much
[2546.32 - 2551.08] though is always Expos so the sun wind
[2548.56 - 2552.48] pollution what you apply cream lotion
[2551.08 - 2555.16] everything is done to this much hand is
[2552.48 - 2557.12] only touching this much so it's the most
[2555.16 - 2559.80] sensitive area of your face more
[2557.12 - 2562.44] sensitized rather than sensitive so now
[2559.80 - 2566.04] that we know cleansing and cleaning and
[2562.44 - 2568.40] not to touch our face how do we protect
[2566.04 - 2570.32] ourselves so protection of course the
[2568.40 - 2571.56] minute you say protection people say SPF
[2570.32 - 2572.88] right because we are only thinking we
[2571.56 - 2574.88] protecting from the Sun there's so much
[2572.88 - 2577.40] more to protect from but let's start
[2574.88 - 2579.44] from SPF so when you pick up sun
[2577.40 - 2581.48] protection is very important in the
[2579.44 - 2582.92] sunny hours whether you are indoor
[2581.48 - 2585.92] whether you're outdoor whether there's a
[2582.92 - 2587.92] cloud cover you need sun protection if
[2585.92 - 2590.20] the Sun is up and giving you light if
[2587.92 - 2591.84] there is day you need sunscreen so
[2590.20 - 2594.40] that's number one now how do you choose
[2591.84 - 2597.48] the sunscreen right you need to look at
[2594.40 - 2601.72] a number called SPF which is sun
[2597.48 - 2604.12] protection factor which means one SPF
[2601.72 - 2608.24] will give me 10 minutes of safety in the
[2604.12 - 2610.88] sun Under the Sun so if it is 50 SPF
[2608.24 - 2614.32] ideally I will get 50 into 10 500
[2610.88 - 2616.36] minutes of safety mhm now do I really
[2614.32 - 2618.20] get that maybe not because to get that
[2616.36 - 2619.56] there is a certain quantity of sunscreen
[2618.20 - 2622.12] that we need to apply which most of us
[2619.56 - 2623.72] don't so every third fourth hour you can
[2622.12 - 2626.04] reapply the sunscreen if you're really
[2623.72 - 2627.64] out in the sun if you're in the shade
[2626.04 - 2630.44] maybe not that many times again and
[2627.64 - 2632.24] again so that is number one which is SPF
[2630.44 - 2633.08] second Factor you see on the sunscreen
[2632.24 - 2636.80] is
[2633.08 - 2639.68] TPA which is tan protection index M
[2636.80 - 2642.40] which is usually triple plus 4 plus 1
[2639.68 - 2644.76] plus 4 plus is the highest so you see
[2642.40 - 2647.48] what is the tan protection that protects
[2644.76 - 2649.72] you from tan the other indication that
[2647.48 - 2652.48] you can see is IR protection which is
[2649.72 - 2654.36] infrared protection that is what causes
[2652.48 - 2656.92] this hot sensation when you're under the
[2654.36 - 2659.32] sun the infrared spectrum of the Sun Sun
[2656.92 - 2661.24] Ray is what gives you that heat so if
[2659.32 - 2663.68] you have issues like redness of the skin
[2661.24 - 2665.44] already irritated skin skin which is
[2663.68 - 2667.20] lighter than the rest of them your
[2665.44 - 2669.96] burning becomes so much more so you need
[2667.20 - 2672.12] to look at the IR if you have acne any
[2669.96 - 2674.00] inflammatory disorders make sure it is
[2672.12 - 2676.56] IR positive your skin care your
[2674.00 - 2678.40] sunscreen so this is your sunscreen now
[2676.56 - 2680.80] there are different types there is gel
[2678.40 - 2683.52] based sunscreen there is Fusion
[2680.80 - 2685.84] technology which is more like a like a
[2683.52 - 2688.48] liquid like a milk which flows there's
[2685.84 - 2690.80] transparent sunscreens these are million
[2688.48 - 2693.04] type of sunscreens which are available
[2690.80 - 2694.92] depending on whether your skin is oily
[2693.04 - 2696.28] whether it is not oily you choose a few
[2694.92 - 2698.44] Brands and you take you know what's
[2696.28 - 2701.36] going through my head right no sunscreen
[2698.44 - 2703.96] is like an umbrella for your skin yeah
[2701.36 - 2708.32] yes it's like assistant is holding an
[2703.96 - 2710.60] umbrella for you y yep wow so that is
[2708.32 - 2712.48] that and then you can also end up
[2710.60 - 2714.28] choosing the form of sunscreen you want
[2712.48 - 2716.96] do you want like a creamy application
[2714.28 - 2718.92] format do you want a powder format do
[2716.96 - 2721.32] you want a stick format which is so much
[2718.92 - 2723.80] easier do you want an aerosol format
[2721.32 - 2724.92] which is even more easier now aerosol
[2723.80 - 2727.16] not happening there are certain
[2724.92 - 2728.80] chemicals which makes it aerosol which
[2727.16 - 2730.24] could be eventually harmful for your
[2728.80 - 2732.56] General Health so I don't usually say
[2730.24 - 2735.36] aerosols or sunscreen sprays for
[2732.56 - 2736.48] children um stick is very easy for
[2735.36 - 2737.52] children because they'll be running
[2736.48 - 2738.80] around you can just catch them and you
[2737.52 - 2741.64] can just do the stick and make them run
[2738.80 - 2743.40] away okay uh powder is nice on an oily
[2741.64 - 2747.24] skin because it also acts as an
[2743.40 - 2749.40] absorbent M um Emulsion is nice for a
[2747.24 - 2752.24] dry skin or anybody else who doesn't
[2749.40 - 2753.80] like too much of a cakey feeling silicon
[2752.24 - 2755.56] based ones are nice for people who want
[2753.80 - 2757.88] just a matte effect but don't mind
[2755.56 - 2761.16] applying things so so this is a very
[2757.88 - 2763.80] large view of sunscreen now above 50 SPF
[2761.16 - 2767.04] is useless because Beyond 50 to 100
[2763.80 - 2770.08] you'll only get a protection of some 02
[2767.04 - 2771.88] or 03 per extra even if it was 100 SPF
[2770.08 - 2774.36] so after 50 if they're writing something
[2771.88 - 2776.12] it's mostly just a marketing to reapply
[2774.36 - 2779.32] it's it is you should reapply that
[2776.12 - 2781.52] doesn't mean 100 means 100 into 10 50 is
[2779.32 - 2783.04] the best after that is just a marketing
[2781.52 - 2785.68] thing that people end up putting more
[2783.04 - 2786.60] number you mentioned that you I was my
[2785.68 - 2789.20] mind I'm thinking okay I'm going to
[2786.60 - 2791.60] apply again I got to I've applied it
[2789.20 - 2793.40] once do I need to wash my face and then
[2791.60 - 2795.00] apply it the second time yeah because I
[2793.40 - 2797.08] was thinking like layer upon layer of
[2795.00 - 2799.32] something you like a lot of times I end
[2797.08 - 2801.48] up telling my patients that in if you're
[2799.32 - 2803.08] going on a sunny holiday like a beach
[2801.48 - 2804.84] holiday don't put a moisturizer and
[2803.08 - 2806.40] sunscreen firstly because if it's sticky
[2804.84 - 2808.52] then you won't apply enough sunscreen I
[2806.40 - 2809.96] want you to apply liberal sunscreen so
[2808.52 - 2812.04] don't put moisturizer at all today
[2809.96 - 2814.36] sunscreen has hydronic acid yo cing
[2812.04 - 2817.08] agent things in it so choose the right
[2814.36 - 2819.40] sunscreen and apply you can even do
[2817.08 - 2821.40] sunscreen so you apply an Emulsion
[2819.40 - 2823.60] sunscreen which has all these extra skin
[2821.40 - 2825.60] friendly ingredients plus you apply
[2823.60 - 2827.24] either the powder or the stick or the
[2825.60 - 2829.48] silicone whichever you like and your
[2827.24 - 2830.92] skin likes on top of it so you're double
[2829.48 - 2833.00] layering it so that's called double
[2830.92 - 2835.52] sunscreen so that is something that you
[2833.00 - 2837.72] can end up using which might be extra
[2835.52 - 2840.36] protection for you but if you want to
[2837.72 - 2842.52] reapply then you can reapply either a
[2840.36 - 2844.80] powder or a stick depending on your skin
[2842.52 - 2846.64] care then you don't have to wash off but
[2844.80 - 2848.40] if you have sweat and dirt and Grime on
[2846.64 - 2850.72] your face then it's best to wash off and
[2848.40 - 2852.16] then reapply anything so we have
[2850.72 - 2854.00] completed
[2852.16 - 2856.92] cleansing then
[2854.00 - 2859.72] protection now is nourishment yeah
[2856.92 - 2862.36] what's your take on nourishment simple
[2859.72 - 2864.48] moisturizer so it could simply be that
[2862.36 - 2866.48] if your skin is for example mature and
[2864.48 - 2868.60] you need more then you can look at
[2866.48 - 2870.20] ceramides you can look at peptides you
[2868.60 - 2873.04] can look at all of this to nourish it
[2870.20 - 2874.96] even further or if you're looking at
[2873.04 - 2876.84] simply my skin is feeling very
[2874.96 - 2879.32] dehydrated then you look at more High
[2876.84 - 2881.56] honic acid what gives you that
[2879.32 - 2883.32] water so you look at the necessary
[2881.56 - 2885.52] ingredients in your nourishment
[2883.32 - 2888.44] nourishment is mostly like quenching the
[2885.52 - 2894.04] skin feeding the skin certain vitamins
[2888.44 - 2895.72] like C B5 B3 naside all this can go in
[2894.04 - 2898.36] you know doctor I'm smiling because once
[2895.72 - 2900.08] I went shopping with my wife and I was
[2898.36 - 2903.68] in this beauty store and I was looking
[2900.08 - 2906.48] at a shampoo bottle is nanite collagen
[2903.68 - 2907.96] arine B1 B2 I was like I can drink this
[2906.48 - 2910.60] sh
[2907.96 - 2913.12] bottle so nourishment even happens
[2910.60 - 2916.16] externally is there a way that skin
[2913.12 - 2918.20] scientists uh when they do the research
[2916.16 - 2920.84] they're able to see the nourishment on
[2918.20 - 2923.48] the skin Matrix do you look at as a
[2920.84 - 2925.32] hydrometer or something to check there
[2923.48 - 2927.32] are there are there are a lot of things
[2925.32 - 2929.24] there are hydrometers that you can you
[2927.32 - 2930.88] know see how you reading these studies
[2929.24 - 2932.40] and then saying okay I want to give my
[2930.88 - 2934.80] patient ceramide I want to give my
[2932.40 - 2936.36] patient depti no you know reading each
[2934.80 - 2939.16] patient becomes honestly difficult there
[2936.36 - 2940.80] are lot lot of cameras now um I can't
[2939.16 - 2942.64] even remember the name there are so many
[2940.80 - 2943.92] that you can put your face in and they
[2942.64 - 2945.56] will tell you where is the pigment where
[2943.92 - 2947.92] is the UI damage where is this where is
[2945.56 - 2950.84] that all of that but honestly with a
[2947.92 - 2954.12] naked eye yeah these are all more and
[2950.84 - 2956.04] more fanciness to kind of make it all
[2954.12 - 2958.00] look oh my God all this is happening but
[2956.04 - 2960.16] a lot of times you can look at them and
[2958.00 - 2963.36] you can say like for example if you want
[2960.16 - 2965.12] to see a genetic Gene for diabetes you
[2963.36 - 2967.04] don't need to necessarily do a gene
[2965.12 - 2968.56] testing you can ask the blood test
[2967.04 - 2969.84] simple or you can say family history
[2968.56 - 2971.88] blood test also don't want family
[2969.84 - 2973.68] history look at him he's obese Central
[2971.88 - 2975.08] girth is high BMR is different then you
[2973.68 - 2977.36] say oh I'm predicting you're going to be
[2975.08 - 2980.12] diabetic in some time his eating pattern
[2977.36 - 2981.80] that you can make clinical as simple as
[2980.12 - 2984.36] that is or as complex as you want to
[2981.80 - 2986.16] when your nourishment start when should
[2984.36 - 2987.96] nourishment start again the day you're
[2986.16 - 2990.16] born the oiling that is done to you is
[2987.96 - 2992.40] nourishment to the skin I've seen most
[2990.16 - 2994.12] families after the baby the kid is five
[2992.40 - 2996.20] six years of age then there is no
[2994.12 - 2998.80] skincare routine I keep shouting my son
[2996.20 - 3000.12] I can go put moisturizer I can go put
[2998.80 - 3002.68] moisturizer you're going to suffer like
[3000.12 - 3006.00] Papa with with bad skin and you can't
[3002.68 - 3009.12] rejuvenate it in your 40s and 50s true
[3006.00 - 3011.04] so teenagers how important is it for
[3009.12 - 3012.76] them to nourish because where I'm going
[3011.04 - 3015.92] with this doct is we'll come back later
[3012.76 - 3017.88] which is how people eat today yeah but I
[3015.92 - 3021.04] want people to also understand is that
[3017.88 - 3023.36] skin care routine is so important so for
[3021.04 - 3026.12] teenagers the nourishment routine what
[3023.36 - 3027.68] would you advise so you're so right you
[3026.12 - 3029.40] know when the kid is born till it is
[3027.68 - 3031.48] under our control we putting oil
[3029.40 - 3033.00] whatever whatever whatever after what
[3031.48 - 3034.96] when it is out of our control and says
[3033.00 - 3037.56] do not touch me then the Skin Care is
[3034.96 - 3040.40] gone for a toss till they start
[3037.56 - 3041.88] Instagram and they start looking at
[3040.40 - 3044.60] various other people
[3041.88 - 3046.80] looking saying now I want and then they
[3044.60 - 3049.44] go and do all s of wrong things at after
[3046.80 - 3052.08] around 13 14 depending on which family
[3049.44 - 3054.44] gives Instagram at what time so that
[3052.08 - 3055.96] inrim which is actually the very crucial
[3054.44 - 3058.36] period because everybody's also going
[3055.96 - 3060.80] through hormone changes M maximum sun
[3058.36 - 3062.72] exposure happens then correct dust wind
[3060.80 - 3064.68] happens then you're expanding in your
[3062.72 - 3068.32] body so there's growth of everything
[3064.68 - 3070.44] happening then your nutrition is formed
[3068.32 - 3073.04] in your head as your pattern your pallet
[3070.44 - 3074.40] is being formed so it's very important
[3073.04 - 3076.80] that everything is affecting you the
[3074.40 - 3080.16] hormone the nutrition your growth spurt
[3076.80 - 3083.00] itself your exposure to everything so
[3080.16 - 3085.44] therefore at that time skin care
[3083.00 - 3088.32] inculcated into a person like brushing
[3085.44 - 3090.32] your teeth is very very important mhm
[3088.32 - 3092.24] hygiene like I say small Skin Care at
[3090.32 - 3094.24] that moment could be hygiene make sure
[3092.24 - 3095.84] your scalp is clean make sure the kid is
[3094.24 - 3098.08] actually having a head wash at least
[3095.84 - 3100.36] alternate days making sure kid is
[3098.08 - 3102.12] changing their bed sheets pillow cases
[3100.36 - 3104.52] in a where is washed a particular way
[3102.12 - 3107.52] changed a particular way moisturizing
[3104.52 - 3110.04] the body maybe not a long hot shower
[3107.52 - 3111.76] these are small small hot shower right
[3110.04 - 3114.12] that destroys teenage skin correct
[3111.76 - 3115.60] completely I know so many teenagers and
[3114.12 - 3117.56] parents complain to me that they are in
[3115.60 - 3120.32] the bathroom forever and when they come
[3117.56 - 3122.96] out the bathrooms like a sa yeah you
[3120.32 - 3126.56] know so okay so everyone out there Dr
[3122.96 - 3129.72] Rashmi skin expert dermatologist the
[3126.56 - 3132.24] guru of skin is saying youngsters don't
[3129.72 - 3135.68] have hot showers for too long tepid
[3132.24 - 3139.32] water room temperature water and
[3135.68 - 3142.00] speaking of temperature water uh I see
[3139.32 - 3143.76] sometimes people talking about ice bowl
[3142.00 - 3146.08] and putting your face into tighten your
[3143.76 - 3148.48] pole what's your opinion on that it just
[3146.08 - 3149.60] it's like a again shock to the skin
[3148.48 - 3151.76] right so we don't want to be shocking
[3149.60 - 3153.84] the skin actually um if you shock there
[3151.76 - 3156.52] are certain protective mechanism which
[3153.84 - 3160.00] actually comes alive in you so it's okay
[3156.52 - 3162.56] to shock but please beware I myself did
[3160.00 - 3164.64] a real once said that you know with
[3162.56 - 3168.04] easier way we all don't have you know
[3164.64 - 3170.68] ice buckets to dip in after the um
[3168.04 - 3172.68] workout so you finish workout come in
[3170.68 - 3174.56] have a hot water shower and immediately
[3172.68 - 3176.28] turn the thing to cold and that time it
[3174.56 - 3178.48] was Jan I think or December when I did
[3176.28 - 3179.92] this real you got a catch no I'll tell
[3178.48 - 3181.44] you what happened then I did a ice cold
[3179.92 - 3182.84] immediately and I said have a shower and
[3181.44 - 3184.12] that that's done your body you go
[3182.84 - 3185.60] through right so that's your shock and
[3184.12 - 3188.04] you've got what you have to from the ice
[3185.60 - 3189.88] and you're done then I got a DM from a
[3188.04 - 3191.16] from one of my followers saying dog I
[3189.88 - 3194.36] think you should put a disclaimer in
[3191.16 - 3197.32] this reel because I did this once much
[3194.36 - 3198.56] before and um I ended up fainting
[3197.32 - 3201.36] passing out
[3198.56 - 3202.48] there so that shock can be that extent
[3201.36 - 3205.08] of Vaso
[3202.48 - 3206.88] constriction that if you are a low blood
[3205.08 - 3209.72] pressure patient you can just all in the
[3206.88 - 3212.60] shower so please when you listen to
[3209.72 - 3214.84] things understand these things that we
[3212.60 - 3216.80] give out on 3 seconds because you all
[3214.84 - 3218.68] don't have patience to listen to Long
[3216.80 - 3220.16] format now thankfully to all of you
[3218.68 - 3222.12] podcast has become a thing that people
[3220.16 - 3223.72] want to listen otherwise oh no attention
[3222.12 - 3224.88] span 30 second talk finish in 30 seconds
[3223.72 - 3226.92] finish in 30 seconds you're like how do
[3224.88 - 3229.28] I give everything in 30 seconds you say
[3226.92 - 3231.32] something so it's fully out of context
[3229.28 - 3234.48] it's not generalized then you end up
[3231.32 - 3236.12] doing it and things may go wrong so my
[3234.48 - 3238.24] whole point is I believe in shock I
[3236.12 - 3240.84] believe even icing but has to be done by
[3238.24 - 3242.48] the right people right context after the
[3240.84 - 3244.68] physician has looked at you and said
[3242.48 - 3247.00] you're generally a healthy person and
[3244.68 - 3248.92] can take that shock other you fall into
[3247.00 - 3251.64] your ice tub something else might happen
[3248.92 - 3253.28] so speaking of correcting what people
[3251.64 - 3254.96] should not be doing the fourth pillar
[3253.28 - 3257.04] comes in right which is correction and
[3254.96 - 3258.84] skin talk to us about correction
[3257.04 - 3260.56] correction for me is when you have a
[3258.84 - 3262.48] problem you have an acne you go to your
[3260.56 - 3263.88] Dermatology she'll give you a correction
[3262.48 - 3265.20] that is your correction you have
[3263.88 - 3267.08] pigmentation you've gone to your doctor
[3265.20 - 3268.96] she's given you most I like doing
[3267.08 - 3270.76] correction at night nourishing at night
[3268.96 - 3273.28] morning just
[3270.76 - 3276.60] protection makes sense yeah makes real
[3273.28 - 3280.24] sense the face is the soul to the world
[3276.60 - 3284.68] right and you are what you eat very much
[3280.24 - 3288.56] so I wanted to bring you in as the guru
[3284.68 - 3292.40] of the skin which is how important is
[3288.56 - 3294.60] nutrition to you everything to me skin
[3292.40 - 3296.92] is just literally like a diagnostic tool
[3294.60 - 3299.04] for what's happening inside
[3296.92 - 3301.24] for example if there's anemia skin is
[3299.04 - 3305.80] pale if there's excess sugar skin looks
[3301.24 - 3307.88] dark if there is uh let's say vitamin uh
[3305.80 - 3311.72] upheaval certain vitamins make you look
[3307.88 - 3313.60] very cracked and very dark and protein
[3311.72 - 3316.96] goes down you can actually see brittle
[3313.60 - 3319.56] hair brittle nails so everything is
[3316.96 - 3322.60] about what you have put into you is what
[3319.56 - 3324.48] is seen outside there is these zero fat
[3322.60 - 3326.32] diets people do instantly you end up
[3324.48 - 3329.60] looking at the skin getting looking very
[3326.32 - 3332.80] very aged and crinkled and dry so
[3329.60 - 3337.16] literally what you put in how how good
[3332.80 - 3339.32] is your core is how the skin glows so
[3337.16 - 3342.00] skin hair and nail are but simply
[3339.32 - 3345.76] byproducts of
[3342.00 - 3347.40] well-being okay so having said that Ryan
[3345.76 - 3350.92] I want to ask
[3347.40 - 3354.56] you how do you end up you know I've seen
[3350.92 - 3356.92] a lot of dietitians who eliminate no uh
[3354.56 - 3359.28] sugar at all or no
[3356.92 - 3361.80] uh fruit at all or let's say no oil at
[3359.28 - 3364.96] all which is more sinful what is your
[3361.80 - 3367.32] take on Elimination Diet or are you all
[3364.96 - 3370.08] inclusive but in a
[3367.32 - 3372.20] limit for me over the years of practice
[3370.08 - 3374.92] I've seen bio individuality works and no
[3372.20 - 3377.00] one size fits all true so there are
[3374.92 - 3378.88] people who you know when you turn the
[3377.00 - 3381.32] skin from outside and put it inside it
[3378.88 - 3384.32] becomes your gut yeah and they have very
[3381.32 - 3388.04] resilient skin inside the gut is really
[3384.32 - 3390.36] strong so the Elimination Diet actually
[3388.04 - 3391.64] cures up certain of their issues and
[3390.36 - 3393.84] then they can get back to eating
[3391.64 - 3396.20] normally but then there are some of us
[3393.84 - 3398.32] who are got very sensitive guts or
[3396.20 - 3400.32] sensitive skin I believe that when you
[3398.32 - 3402.36] put food inside and it sits inside your
[3400.32 - 3404.00] stomach your skin sometimes can show
[3402.36 - 3408.32] what you have done of course of course
[3404.00 - 3411.76] and so from that perspective um I do the
[3408.32 - 3414.00] blood test I do the nutrigenomics in the
[3411.76 - 3416.84] nutrigenomics I'm very fond to look at
[3414.00 - 3419.00] the caffeine sensitivity the
[3416.84 - 3421.60] lactose sensitivity and the gluten
[3419.00 - 3423.72] sensitivity now if a person tries to say
[3421.60 - 3425.76] that no but you know I've eaten wheat my
[3423.72 - 3428.48] entire life and there's no problem then
[3425.76 - 3430.84] I do a food intolerance blood test so if
[3428.48 - 3433.20] I get enough of signals coming to me
[3430.84 - 3436.40] saying that hey this is not working then
[3433.20 - 3439.52] I try and begin to counsel the client
[3436.40 - 3442.04] saying that hey let's try 3 to six weeks
[3439.52 - 3445.32] on a nutrition plan and let's see if
[3442.04 - 3448.48] there's any Improvement now within the
[3445.32 - 3451.88] first 3 to 5 days is the the gut
[3448.48 - 3455.80] feeling is there and within 10 to 15
[3451.88 - 3458.64] days 90 out of 100 clients will say my
[3455.80 - 3462.28] skin has cleared up of course so from
[3458.64 - 3464.16] that perspective um a lot of people um
[3462.28 - 3465.72] one of the side effects of a great diet
[3464.16 - 3469.28] I won't call it a side effect I'll say a
[3465.72 - 3472.32] good effect a good effect of falling a a
[3469.28 - 3476.36] bio individualized diet is that your
[3472.32 - 3478.88] skin begins to Glow yeah so true so I to
[3476.36 - 3481.40] keep telling my patients to end up doing
[3478.88 - 3483.40] like a food Dairy I tell them just start
[3481.40 - 3486.04] writing down everything do a journaling
[3483.40 - 3489.04] of food so you yourself can understand
[3486.04 - 3490.84] the day you're feeling Burpy bloated and
[3489.04 - 3492.96] you will see very next few days maybe
[3490.84 - 3496.56] there's an acne which will erupt out so
[3492.96 - 3497.56] you know what to eliminate that way so
[3496.56 - 3500.72] as a
[3497.56 - 3503.76] dermatologist and a skin Guru in my
[3500.72 - 3506.48] department of nutrition are there any
[3503.76 - 3509.28] supplements or Botanicals
[3506.48 - 3512.64] that over your years of experience you
[3509.28 - 3515.44] kind of use them as your best friends
[3512.64 - 3517.96] yeah lot of them in fact I believe in
[3515.44 - 3519.76] micronutrition replugging because
[3517.96 - 3521.88] there's one macron nutrition of course
[3519.76 - 3524.60] which experts such as you really take
[3521.88 - 3526.56] care and understand what cab which cab
[3524.60 - 3528.76] how much Cab For example what protein
[3526.56 - 3530.32] which protein how much protein all of
[3528.76 - 3533.72] this is and the oils all of this is
[3530.32 - 3536.88] taken care of then as much as we may eat
[3533.72 - 3538.64] right we may eat healthy the produce
[3536.88 - 3540.24] itself is not like before right there's
[3538.64 - 3542.64] not enough nutrition in the produce
[3540.24 - 3545.04] itself so you need that little micro
[3542.64 - 3547.52] plugging of nutrition to happen so
[3545.04 - 3549.60] that's when I believe in supplementation
[3547.52 - 3551.76] and in supplementation I've realized
[3549.60 - 3554.28] that I not only look at
[3551.76 - 3556.32] English medicines or not medicines let's
[3554.28 - 3558.72] say vitamins and minerals and amino
[3556.32 - 3561.20] acids Etc but I also like for example
[3558.72 - 3563.08] milk thisle it's a fabulous
[3561.20 - 3565.72] anti-inflammatory and it just comes from
[3563.08 - 3568.80] English intelligence like curcumin comes
[3565.72 - 3570.60] from intelligence so like that I like to
[3568.80 - 3573.24] mix these little things shatavari for
[3570.60 - 3576.40] example comes from our ayurvedic
[3573.24 - 3578.96] intelligence so I like to mix the
[3576.40 - 3581.24] English and the other traditional and
[3578.96 - 3583.44] plug them together towards a goal either
[3581.24 - 3586.64] it is an antioxidant or an
[3583.44 - 3588.52] anti-inflammatory or it is let's say
[3586.64 - 3590.96] something which calms down the hormonal
[3588.52 - 3593.04] upheaval just before a menstrual cycle
[3590.96 - 3594.60] so these are things that I like to put
[3593.04 - 3596.88] together and I believe in them as
[3594.60 - 3599.16] micronutrients to support
[3596.88 - 3601.76] the functioning of the body when people
[3599.16 - 3604.52] walk into your clinic I'm I'm just
[3601.76 - 3607.48] thinking if I was a fly on the wall how
[3604.52 - 3609.32] much of you look of you looking at them
[3607.48 - 3610.88] you would say that is it because they're
[3609.32 - 3614.56] eating too much and therefore they have
[3610.88 - 3618.16] bad skin yeah every every single person
[3614.56 - 3621.16] in my clinic I ask them about their diet
[3618.16 - 3623.20] it is very important for me everybody so
[3621.16 - 3625.28] we ask them about their diet and I just
[3623.20 - 3627.96] tell them I'll send you an elimination
[3625.28 - 3630.00] list and an inclusion list I'm not a
[3627.96 - 3632.52] dietetics expert so I can't give you a
[3630.00 - 3634.16] diet chart and what to do nor will I be
[3632.52 - 3636.52] able to monitor you because I don't have
[3634.16 - 3638.40] that kind of time and bandwidth to that
[3636.52 - 3640.00] subject so then I tell them either you
[3638.40 - 3641.72] can go to your nutritionist and show
[3640.00 - 3643.64] them this elimination list and double
[3641.72 - 3645.20] check with them we also have a
[3643.64 - 3646.84] nutritional supplement list that I will
[3645.20 - 3651.36] give them to
[3646.84 - 3653.88] support so that to me is very important
[3651.36 - 3656.12] a starter point so this comes under the
[3653.88 - 3658.20] nourishment part of one of your pillars
[3656.12 - 3661.20] yeah can any of the nutritional products
[3658.20 - 3664.40] help in the correction part yeah yes a
[3661.20 - 3667.76] lot of them simply for example a vitamin
[3664.40 - 3670.20] D yeah so a lot of them come with very
[3667.76 - 3673.56] fulminant or very infective acne which
[3670.20 - 3676.00] is looking red and angry then I do ask
[3673.56 - 3678.60] them let's say for example for their
[3676.00 - 3680.16] hormonal issues which I ask clinically
[3678.60 - 3682.00] is their breast tenderness do you have
[3680.16 - 3684.04] headache do you have mood swings do you
[3682.00 - 3685.96] have flushing on your face then if all
[3684.04 - 3687.48] of this for example they say yes then I
[3685.96 - 3690.00] already know clinically the prolactin
[3687.48 - 3691.68] may be high mhm then we end up looking
[3690.00 - 3694.32] at their hormone testing to see if
[3691.68 - 3696.44] prolactin is high I won't simply go and
[3694.32 - 3698.64] give a drug to bring the prolactin down
[3696.44 - 3700.28] but I will also check their vitamin D
[3698.64 - 3702.28] because I know the minute I correct the
[3700.28 - 3704.48] vitamin D prolactin will automatically
[3702.28 - 3706.84] start coming down a little or if they
[3704.48 - 3708.88] are on Ant acids then I know that can
[3706.84 - 3710.48] also increase the prolactin levels so
[3708.88 - 3712.72] I'll tell them to cut that so the
[3710.48 - 3714.32] nutrition and what you put into your gut
[3712.72 - 3718.32] becomes so important the way the
[3714.32 - 3721.72] hormones behave there are lot of pro-
[3718.32 - 3724.36] estrogen nutrition uh elements such as
[3721.72 - 3727.32] let's say um flax
[3724.36 - 3729.56] seeds uh soy all of these are very Pro
[3727.32 - 3731.32] estrogenic right so if you're already
[3729.56 - 3734.08] high on estrogen if you're already
[3731.32 - 3736.88] getting a lot of let's say oily skin
[3734.08 - 3739.40] acne prone skin I am not going to load
[3736.88 - 3742.32] you more with that so these are a few
[3739.40 - 3746.20] things that I work with and balance it
[3742.32 - 3749.56] out what is Dr rashmi's nutrition uh
[3746.20 - 3752.64] shedule like so you have beautiful skin
[3749.56 - 3755.36] so I'm I'm so you're like doing stuff on
[3752.64 - 3758.64] yourself and doing the pillars of
[3755.36 - 3760.64] cleansing um what was the second one uh
[3758.64 - 3762.72] protection protction nourishment and
[3760.64 - 3764.36] correction when necessary so from a from
[3762.72 - 3767.56] a nutrition point of view what does your
[3764.36 - 3770.64] day look like so I think I'm pretty much
[3767.56 - 3774.68] a South Indian mhm yeah and I stayed you
[3770.64 - 3777.12] won't believe between 50 and 53 kgs all
[3774.68 - 3780.16] my life all my life from being a
[3777.12 - 3781.68] teenager to now um only last two months
[3780.16 - 3783.40] I've put on after the podcast I'm going
[3781.68 - 3786.32] to ask you tips free
[3783.40 - 3788.12] tips so put on some 2 to three kgs but
[3786.32 - 3789.12] what I have always lived with is three
[3788.12 - 3792.32] meals a
[3789.12 - 3795.36] day so I have my breakfast my lunch and
[3792.32 - 3797.64] my dinner and it is always I know
[3795.36 - 3799.68] intermittent fasting is become a style
[3797.64 - 3801.76] now or a theory that most people are
[3799.68 - 3803.24] talking about but that's how I led life
[3801.76 - 3805.12] my mom always served dinner by around
[3803.24 - 3807.16] 6:37 so even today I have my dinner by
[3805.12 - 3809.96] 6:37 and you continue practice after
[3807.16 - 3811.84] that uh no I finish practice by 7:00
[3809.96 - 3813.56] okay so sometimes it's 7:30 so it goes a
[3811.84 - 3815.44] little delay otherwise that's that's how
[3813.56 - 3817.76] I practice so I have my breakfast at
[3815.44 - 3819.36] 9:00 lunch sometimes because of practice
[3817.76 - 3821.16] gets up and down but I'd like to have it
[3819.36 - 3824.00] at 2:00 then I have my dinner at 7:00
[3821.16 - 3826.76] and I'm done I don't snack in between if
[3824.00 - 3828.40] I feel very hungry by around 12ish if I
[3826.76 - 3831.12] know my lunch is getting delayed I have
[3828.40 - 3832.68] half a Peru which I remove the seed but
[3831.12 - 3835.76] I don't remove the skin so I just have
[3832.68 - 3838.80] half a perro or one orange or one uh
[3835.76 - 3842.48] citrus fruit that's all is what my diet
[3838.80 - 3844.92] is what I've learned and observed why I
[3842.48 - 3846.52] have a constant weight and my skin also
[3844.92 - 3849.44] is good and
[3846.52 - 3852.20] nourished I take one size of let's say
[3849.44 - 3854.28] this much now this is my salad this is
[3852.20 - 3855.72] my soup this is my vegetable this is my
[3854.28 - 3858.40] chicken fish whatever and this is my
[3855.72 - 3861.24] rice okay so what I do is very
[3858.40 - 3863.68] unconsciously I've seen over the years
[3861.24 - 3865.56] my carb is not very big carb is equal to
[3863.68 - 3868.36] my vegetable equal to my protein which
[3865.56 - 3869.60] could could be either a black Dal Gussy
[3868.36 - 3871.60] or something like that or it is the
[3869.60 - 3873.20] chicken or the fish of the day so just
[3871.60 - 3875.32] that much if there is a salad or a soup
[3873.20 - 3878.28] it is just that much so I'm not binging
[3875.32 - 3880.24] on a carb as a natural thing but I don't
[3878.28 - 3882.00] eliminate carb because I know you should
[3880.24 - 3883.84] tell us please tell us about not
[3882.00 - 3886.16] eliminating carbs and I want to ask you
[3883.84 - 3887.72] more so that's been what I atat and a
[3886.16 - 3889.24] few of my supplements that I like can
[3887.72 - 3891.24] change according to the season and my
[3889.24 - 3893.80] age what are the supplements that you
[3891.24 - 3896.16] take so I make sure Primrose is
[3893.80 - 3899.40] something that I like so even evening R
[3896.16 - 3901.60] evening primrose with the flax seed with
[3899.40 - 3903.68] uh with a vitamin E now that as a
[3901.60 - 3905.64] combination works best for you in terms
[3903.68 - 3907.72] of all the omegas that you need but take
[3905.64 - 3910.20] advice take advice from your personal
[3907.72 - 3912.20] Dermatology doctor or a qualified
[3910.20 - 3913.68] dietitian when you take a nutritional
[3912.20 - 3914.84] supplement a lot of people do self
[3913.68 - 3916.12] prescription so this is your
[3914.84 - 3919.28] prescription to yourself like for
[3916.12 - 3921.32] example I see everyone taking glutathion
[3919.28 - 3923.52] vitamin C effervescent tablet in
[3921.32 - 3925.08] effervescent there's so much soda by cup
[3923.52 - 3926.40] which you don't need actually killing
[3925.08 - 3928.04] you're destroying the glutathion but
[3926.40 - 3930.12] that's another story exactly you're
[3928.04 - 3932.64] destroying the glutathion to you're
[3930.12 - 3934.32] changing the pH of the entire gut why
[3932.64 - 3936.92] would you do that you should tell us
[3934.32 - 3938.20] more about that or you take gummies
[3936.92 - 3939.92] because everybody is saying so there's
[3938.20 - 3941.44] so much cellulose and sugar in it you
[3939.92 - 3943.00] just don't need it so yeah
[3941.44 - 3944.80] self-medication not happening about
[3943.00 - 3947.12] nutrition the right format is important
[3944.80 - 3949.64] there's so much science behind it so I
[3947.12 - 3951.64] take bright which is a set of um
[3949.64 - 3953.72] antioxidants with of course the popular
[3951.64 - 3956.16] glutathion in it and many more then I
[3953.72 - 3958.56] take a hydrate which has col collagen in
[3956.16 - 3960.36] a tablet form so I don't have to mask
[3958.56 - 3962.80] the smell and the taste of collagen in a
[3960.36 - 3964.92] liquid form or a powder form so it's
[3962.80 - 3966.88] more in a tablet form with edible
[3964.92 - 3968.92] hyaluronic acid with luttin all of that
[3966.88 - 3971.20] to hydrate so I take something to hold
[3968.92 - 3972.88] the water I take something which is the
[3971.20 - 3975.16] Omega oils which I told you to hold the
[3972.88 - 3976.48] oil and I take something which is an
[3975.16 - 3978.32] antioxidant and an
[3976.48 - 3981.08] anti-inflammatory so these are something
[3978.32 - 3982.88] I'm quite regular with and um I
[3981.08 - 3985.36] definitely see the difference that those
[3982.88 - 3988.52] micronutrient plugging will do to you as
[3985.36 - 3990.72] you grow and if you are to choose five
[3988.52 - 3993.68] of your favorite
[3990.72 - 3996.60] foods rice rice
[3993.68 - 3998.72] rice from a skin perspective skin
[3996.60 - 4000.00] perspective you know I also say from a
[3998.72 - 4001.88] skin perspective there's something
[4000.00 - 4003.56] called as a gut skin axis scientifically
[4001.88 - 4006.24] there's so much more towards the
[4003.56 - 4009.36] microbiome the absorption all of that
[4006.24 - 4012.48] but for me gut skin axis only means eat
[4009.36 - 4014.76] the food that quenches your soul MH for
[4012.48 - 4016.24] me it's curd rice and the day I eat
[4014.76 - 4019.28] something which quench is my soul my
[4016.24 - 4020.76] fish curry and rice this makes me happy
[4019.28 - 4022.48] and when you are happy there's so many
[4020.76 - 4024.96] more happy hormones releases stress
[4022.48 - 4027.52] reduces skin automatically looks good so
[4024.96 - 4029.60] one is the whole nutrition perspective
[4027.52 - 4031.36] which is Elemental knowledge and science
[4029.60 - 4033.80] the physiological part and then the
[4031.36 - 4035.56] psychological part psychological happy
[4033.80 - 4037.20] part so I'm like take something which
[4035.56 - 4039.64] sooths your gut sooths your memory

[4046.08 - 4050.76] and you can take only five foods with
[4048.20 - 4053.24] you and none of your medical equipment
[4050.76 - 4055.24] or your clinic your skin therapist
[4053.24 - 4057.44] nobody's there with you what are the
[4055.24 - 4061.84] five foods you'd carry with you to that
[4057.44 - 4066.36] Island water mhm rice
[4061.84 - 4068.48] mhm remember your skin huh then um can I
[4066.36 - 4070.12] can I take veggies and grow yeah you can
[4068.48 - 4071.44] take veggies and grow so I'll take some
[4070.12 - 4073.24] veggies and then sew there and then
[4071.44 - 4075.72] start growing them some veggies okay
[4073.24 - 4078.08] lots of veggies the fish is there in the
[4075.72 - 4079.44] island yes so that's my Omega C there H
[4078.08 - 4081.96] so I'll catch the fish that's how good
[4079.44 - 4085.20] is omega3 for the skin very good okay
[4081.96 - 4087.44] very good so my fish is come last one
[4085.20 - 4089.04] you can't take sweet no I won't take
[4087.44 - 4089.92] sweet sweet why won't you take sweet
[4089.04 - 4092.12] that's because it's going to kill
[4089.92 - 4093.80] everything that is going to firstly my
[4092.12 - 4095.64] perspective of now I want to stay
[4093.80 - 4097.56] youthful on my skin right it's going to
[4095.64 - 4099.36] make my collagen brittle and it's going
[4097.56 - 4101.80] to break the collagen and kill it make
[4099.36 - 4104.08] the elastin brittle so I don't want it
[4101.80 - 4106.28] it speeds the end glycation of anything
[4104.08 - 4109.72] so the protein becomes brittle I don't
[4106.28 - 4112.48] want sweet for multiple reasons if I'm
[4109.72 - 4114.28] if I'm eating sweet increase the glucose
[4112.48 - 4116.16] and therefore inclusing insulin is that
[4114.28 - 4118.08] why our grandmothers were much younger
[4116.16 - 4120.04] than the current generation in terms of
[4118.08 - 4122.60] their skin and their looks because they
[4120.04 - 4124.32] didn't have that much access to Sugar I
[4122.60 - 4126.76] think our grandmothers were younger
[4124.32 - 4129.32] because they also didn't kill themselves
[4126.76 - 4132.44] to stay lean there was lot more
[4129.32 - 4134.60] subcutaneous fat which is very important
[4132.44 - 4137.56] it is not just a source of nice coating
[4134.60 - 4139.92] under the skin it is also that coating
[4137.56 - 4141.84] holds back even the Skin's collagen
[4139.92 - 4143.76] really well holds a little bit of
[4141.84 - 4146.20] estrogen there for a longer time there's
[4143.76 - 4148.48] a peripheral conversion and estrogen
[4146.20 - 4150.16] there so that is why they looked a lot
[4148.48 - 4151.76] younger and they were less stressed
[4150.16 - 4153.92] there was less pollution less Sun so
[4151.76 - 4156.68] there was multiple Factor true true wise
[4153.92 - 4159.64] words yeah you know you talked about
[4156.68 - 4162.48] glycation so this is basically in my
[4159.64 - 4167.52] opinion sugar going and slapping correct
[4162.48 - 4170.56] so we have HB A1C correct is that the
[4167.52 - 4173.36] same process liation of hemoglobin yeah
[4170.56 - 4175.20] that is a cumulative 3mon analysis of
[4173.36 - 4177.08] how your body is behaving with sugar
[4175.20 - 4179.40] correct so basically the sugar is
[4177.08 - 4183.00] slapping hemoglobin and you can see that
[4179.40 - 4186.84] 3mon period dis glycation happen for
[4183.00 - 4190.20] your skin yeah so glycation is nothing
[4186.84 - 4194.40] but hardening of the protein there so
[4190.20 - 4195.88] that makes it makes the skin c h that's
[4194.40 - 4200.04] why you're saying don't have sugar
[4195.88 - 4202.84] huh and also what happens is um when you
[4200.04 - 4204.96] have sugar that Spike of sugar gives you
[4202.84 - 4207.32] a spike of insulin every time you spike
[4204.96 - 4209.28] sugar insulin keeps spiking K insulin
[4207.32 - 4211.16] sits there because it's spiked out so
[4209.28 - 4213.16] much and the body doesn't even work with
[4211.16 - 4214.76] insulin the way it should work so doc
[4213.16 - 4216.84] what you're tell it's insulin resistance
[4214.76 - 4218.48] doc what you're telling me is I mean
[4216.84 - 4221.28] when we say sugar people think only
[4218.48 - 4223.20] table sugar no but our insulin Spike
[4221.28 - 4225.68] goes up with the carbohydrates that come
[4223.20 - 4228.88] from our food and so if you're eating
[4225.68 - 4231.96] too much you have these constant spikes
[4228.88 - 4234.52] of insulin which is actually aging you
[4231.96 - 4238.00] yeah so would fasting also making you
[4234.52 - 4239.76] darker also making your skin thicker not
[4238.00 - 4241.56] the good thickness of skin that you want
[4239.76 - 4243.60] with collagen but bad thickness of
[4241.56 - 4244.56] elastosis kind of hard thickness that
[4243.60 - 4249.52] you don't
[4244.56 - 4251.44] like so skin simply goes bad with sugar
[4249.52 - 4254.76] also there's insulin like growth factors
[4251.44 - 4255.84] that it stimulates so acne increases so
[4254.76 - 4259.28] sugar is
[4255.84 - 4261.00] a bad story so I get a lot of teenagers
[4259.28 - 4263.56] so like they're like they buy all of
[4261.00 - 4265.60] these products and they do the skin care
[4263.56 - 4267.36] but they're forgetting their diet very
[4265.60 - 4268.72] important and when I say sugar like you
[4267.36 - 4270.92] rightly said they only think tablespoon
[4268.72 - 4272.84] of sugar they'll simply be having an ice
[4270.92 - 4275.56] cream they'll have a cookie which is
[4272.84 - 4278.64] sugar and dairy and mea which is
[4275.56 - 4281.32] processed food which is which is lethal
[4278.64 - 4283.28] that combination is lethal so a cookie a
[4281.32 - 4286.08] cake an ice cream a processed cheese a
[4283.28 - 4288.04] processed meat all these are lethal
[4286.08 - 4289.68] because they have all the three So when
[4288.04 - 4293.12] you say lethal I got a lot of teenage
[4289.68 - 4296.40] girls who are overweight skin is bad
[4293.12 - 4299.96] yeah pcod is a new condition for the
[4296.40 - 4302.16] last decade polycystic ovarian disorder
[4299.96 - 4305.40] do you see a lot of pcod cases and what
[4302.16 - 4308.40] are the Skin Care issues associated with
[4305.40 - 4310.24] this condition so PCOS is literally a
[4308.40 - 4313.48] lifestyle disease is what I call it
[4310.24 - 4315.00] starts off by wrong eating by stress
[4313.48 - 4317.80] these are two things which if I can
[4315.00 - 4319.56] narrow Odon are the triggers for this
[4317.80 - 4320.96] does it happen with these teenage girls
[4319.56 - 4323.40] when they're finding their identity
[4320.96 - 4325.12] early teen years mom don't correct me on
[4323.40 - 4326.76] eating I want to eat whatever I want I'm
[4325.12 - 4328.32] stressed out you think that could be a
[4326.76 - 4329.88] starting point yeah stress and eating
[4328.32 - 4331.84] are the two starting points that's your
[4329.88 - 4334.36] lifestyle which the mother intervene at
[4331.84 - 4337.24] that point yeah so when I have PCOS
[4334.36 - 4339.28] patients coming in I have the mother the
[4337.24 - 4341.56] father and when the girl is sitting I
[4339.28 - 4344.36] tell them you can't tell the child not
[4341.56 - 4345.96] to eat XYZ I can't tell the child you
[4344.36 - 4348.24] better get lose that weight that you've
[4345.96 - 4351.76] gained when both of you are this on the
[4348.24 - 4354.24] weighing scale so parents family parents
[4351.76 - 4356.96] need to lead by exactly you have to be a
[4354.24 - 4359.64] family together to help the child to
[4356.96 - 4362.52] look a certain way be a certain way it's
[4359.64 - 4364.96] not about looks it's about health so you
[4362.52 - 4367.12] have to end up having what the family
[4364.96 - 4370.48] eats is what shows on the kids and you
[4367.12 - 4372.40] all together so it has to be a food
[4370.48 - 4375.56] Habit in C if you as parents are going
[4372.40 - 4377.76] out every day partying and eating and a
[4375.56 - 4380.28] teenage child to sit down and eat gka
[4377.76 - 4382.48] it's not going to happen and at home if
[4380.28 - 4384.64] you have this much cooking and that much
[4382.48 - 4388.04] happening it is it has to be a
[4384.64 - 4390.76] discipline that's in the family so
[4388.04 - 4393.80] that's important now cut the question of
[4390.76 - 4395.76] PC in my practice it's a big chunk of
[4393.80 - 4399.32] practice these days because they present
[4395.76 - 4401.84] one with acne two because there's
[4399.32 - 4403.36] insulin resistance also Associated PCOS
[4401.84 - 4405.28] there's lot of skin pigmentation
[4403.36 - 4406.88] especially on the neck on the forehead
[4405.28 - 4409.16] on the temples on the cheeks that can
[4406.88 - 4412.08] happen you could end up having excessive
[4409.16 - 4414.52] hair growth on the face so very maleik
[4412.08 - 4416.88] terminal hair yeah heroism is what can
[4414.52 - 4420.36] happen on the face you have hair fall
[4416.88 - 4422.32] from the scalp all of this is part of
[4420.36 - 4424.84] PCOS sometimes their periods might be
[4422.32 - 4426.00] very regular so today also when I saw
[4424.84 - 4427.44] the results and I told a patient oh
[4426.00 - 4429.20] you're marginally pcis we'll have to do
[4427.44 - 4430.84] this she said but my periods are regular
[4429.20 - 4433.68] periods can still be regular you can
[4430.84 - 4435.52] still have PS you needn't be obese or
[4433.68 - 4438.72] overweight you can still be p P which is
[4435.52 - 4441.40] a lean PCOS we call it so it could be
[4438.72 - 4443.08] either a source from the ovary which is
[4441.40 - 4445.64] kind of driving it wrong or it could be
[4443.08 - 4447.76] adrenals which is driving it wrong so we
[4445.64 - 4450.20] do some blood test to figure out what is
[4447.76 - 4452.40] driving your PCOS and treat it
[4450.20 - 4454.36] accordingly very important for us to
[4452.40 - 4456.44] also correct the
[4454.36 - 4458.56] nutrition a doctor said correct your
[4456.44 - 4461.52] nutrition for pcod condition and parents
[4458.56 - 4463.76] you need to lead by example now speaking
[4461.52 - 4466.52] about uh you know parents I remember
[4463.76 - 4468.68] when I went to study uh my mom told me
[4466.52 - 4471.92] don't drink tap water when I went to
[4468.68 - 4473.96] Scotland now when I went to Scotland you
[4471.92 - 4475.92] know that in Europe water can be drunk
[4473.96 - 4478.52] from the T but some of this Indian
[4475.92 - 4480.56] mentality mindsets we still you can't
[4478.52 - 4483.60] take it so then I found out that bottle
[4480.56 - 4485.88] water was really expensive and uh orange
[4483.60 - 4488.60] juice was really cheap so I ended up
[4485.88 - 4491.36] drinking orange juice for insulin Spike
[4488.60 - 4493.08] and how yeah I ended up drinking orange
[4491.36 - 4494.52] juice for nearly four to five months and
[4493.08 - 4497.36] then suddenly my nails started going
[4494.52 - 4499.92] yellow oh and I got scared and I went to
[4497.36 - 4501.32] the doctor at the NHS and he says he he
[4499.92 - 4503.12] did all the questions the doctors asked
[4501.32 - 4504.84] he just said are you drinking too much
[4503.12 - 4507.68] of orange juice so I think there was
[4504.84 - 4510.40] this case of pigment of people having uh
[4507.68 - 4513.72] too much of nutrition so as a doctor
[4510.40 - 4516.24] have you seen cases where eating too
[4513.72 - 4518.68] much of carrots or orange juice or for
[4516.24 - 4520.36] that matter any food in your career like
[4518.68 - 4521.56] you can look at a person like what do
[4520.36 - 4524.56] you orange
[4521.56 - 4527.72] fellow so are the things that you can
[4524.56 - 4530.48] tell people out there that which is yeah
[4527.72 - 4532.28] like oh I know you're doing this nut and
[4530.48 - 4534.84] you have a skin problem or your skin is
[4532.28 - 4537.16] orange in color so share with us some of
[4534.84 - 4540.56] the secrets that you get out of I think
[4537.16 - 4542.92] the only thing I say is everything even
[4540.56 - 4544.88] the probably nectar is good in a limit
[4542.92 - 4549.08] you over drink it God knows what happens
[4544.88 - 4550.76] MH so you need to be in limit everything
[4549.08 - 4552.60] like you would say as a nutrition carb
[4550.76 - 4555.16] is good in a limit you can't eliminate
[4552.60 - 4557.48] this is good in a limit so likewise for
[4555.16 - 4559.36] me everything is good in the limit so
[4557.48 - 4562.12] especially vitamin tablets that you keep
[4559.36 - 4563.68] popping be very careful so there are to
[4562.12 - 4566.04] simplify it there's a set of vitamins
[4563.68 - 4567.92] let's say a d e k which is fat soluble
[4566.04 - 4569.92] vitamins you end up having them without
[4567.92 - 4571.16] the doctor's prescription you're going
[4569.92 - 4574.00] to end up with
[4571.16 - 4575.96] toxicosis so likewise a lot of food
[4574.00 - 4578.20] substance in excess but honestly right
[4575.96 - 4580.04] now I don't see much of people in food
[4578.20 - 4581.44] binging which becomes excess except
[4580.04 - 4584.60] glucose
[4581.44 - 4587.08] insulin okay which are the foods that a
[4584.60 - 4588.72] teen teager or anybody who has oily skin
[4587.08 - 4592.08] that they should avoid what do you tell
[4588.72 - 4593.96] them I usually generally tell them fried
[4592.08 - 4595.44] food not because fry exactly oil comes
[4593.96 - 4597.04] out on the skin because fried food is
[4595.44 - 4598.88] highly inflammatory especially if it is
[4597.04 - 4600.88] refried with oils which are already so
[4598.88 - 4602.60] all the street food that we get today is
[4600.88 - 4604.96] really bad and somebody the other day
[4602.60 - 4607.00] told me you will know the answer that
[4604.96 - 4609.12] there is a way a certain oil that they
[4607.00 - 4611.68] use which is apparently the cheap oil
[4609.12 - 4614.04] the palm oil yeah where you can't say
[4611.68 - 4617.40] which oil it is or the flavor you don't
[4614.04 - 4620.16] get so we did the costing of oils okay
[4617.40 - 4623.76] and so if you and I look look at pure
[4620.16 - 4625.84] ghee it's in excess of 700 rupees a kg
[4623.76 - 4628.88] okay whereas the other oils will come
[4625.84 - 4630.04] down the the range and palm oil comes in
[4628.88 - 4633.00] at the
[4630.04 - 4635.20] cheapest so if you and I opened up a
[4633.00 - 4637.52] restaurant and imagine cooking a food
[4635.20 - 4638.96] and G how expensive the dish would be so
[4637.52 - 4641.52] you're looking at the profitability of
[4638.96 - 4644.20] the restaurant yeah so restaurants are
[4641.52 - 4646.20] not looking at the nutritional element
[4644.20 - 4648.52] of foods they're looking at the
[4646.20 - 4651.12] financial element or the profitability
[4648.52 - 4653.36] return so the palm oil is something that
[4651.12 - 4656.24] I think the fried fruit on the streets
[4653.36 - 4657.80] is what is is slapping us but that's the
[4656.24 - 4660.00] inflammatory markup is there any other
[4657.80 - 4662.04] foods that you sugars we said already
[4660.00 - 4663.80] yeah so what are the foods that needs to
[4662.04 - 4665.96] be avoided if you have an acne prone
[4663.80 - 4668.96] oily skin one of course is anything that
[4665.96 - 4670.20] is fried and fried in the wrong oil two
[4668.96 - 4672.44] you could also stop anything which
[4670.20 - 4674.04] spikes your glucose there for your
[4672.44 - 4675.80] insulin so anything that is sweet to the
[4674.04 - 4678.72] tongue has to be be avoided not just
[4675.80 - 4680.92] tablespoon of sugar and third will be
[4678.72 - 4683.08] inflammatory which means to say whatever
[4680.92 - 4684.56] makes you feel bloated Burpy you know
[4683.08 - 4686.52] the next day skin is feeling red and
[4684.56 - 4688.56] irritated it could be different for
[4686.52 - 4690.24] different things for one it could be mea
[4688.56 - 4693.08] for one it could be wheat for one it
[4690.24 - 4695.20] could be milk so whether it is dairy or
[4693.08 - 4697.52] mea or gluten I leave it to you to
[4695.20 - 4699.68] decide if you're so Keen you could go to
[4697.52 - 4702.04] you and do a food tolerance test and do
[4699.68 - 4704.20] all of that to figure out which is it
[4702.04 - 4706.76] you know one way when people don't want
[4704.20 - 4709.12] to do the test resting I just asked them
[4706.76 - 4712.08] to check their resting heart rate for 10
[4709.12 - 4716.32] days then I tell them you eliminate
[4712.08 - 4718.24] these Basic kuili Foods yeah and we
[4716.32 - 4720.24] invariably see a drop in the resting
[4718.24 - 4722.56] heart rate really by three to five
[4720.24 - 4725.60] points but that's significant enough to
[4722.56 - 4730.32] convince my client that there
[4725.60 - 4732.68] does show a link between the food wow
[4730.32 - 4734.92] and your inflammatory markers a simple a
[4732.68 - 4736.28] simple dipstick test that you can do
[4734.92 - 4738.64] many people do not want to do a food
[4736.28 - 4741.52] intolerance test many people are in
[4738.64 - 4743.80] denial that food could be the causative
[4741.52 - 4746.16] condition so now I want to ask you for
[4743.80 - 4749.04] PCOS if I can ask you to give me a free
[4746.16 - 4751.48] diet for all my patients of PCOS so so
[4749.04 - 4755.28] number one is what I feel is that you
[4751.48 - 4756.92] know and you laugh at this but I I call
[4755.28 - 4760.80] the cysts in the ovary as the pimples
[4756.92 - 4762.64] inside the ovaries yeah right okay now
[4760.80 - 4764.84] why do we get pimples it's because some
[4762.64 - 4766.28] food you're eating that is wrong yeah
[4764.84 - 4770.00] you already told me that don't need too
[4766.28 - 4772.28] much of sugar uh and um PCOS is insulin
[4770.00 - 4775.96] resistance so we have this whole Cascade
[4772.28 - 4779.32] that comes back yeah I have identified
[4775.96 - 4782.36] it as a logical conjecture that between
[4779.32 - 4785.68] the ages of 11 and 15 as the girl is
[4782.36 - 4788.36] growing up she's forming her identity
[4785.68 - 4790.44] her mensis and hormonal structure starts
[4788.36 - 4792.76] in so there is the mood fluctuation
[4790.44 - 4795.80] there is a behavioral change uh she's
[4792.76 - 4797.52] moving into adult mindset of thinking
[4795.80 - 4800.32] and therefore I believe that food
[4797.52 - 4802.48] represents one independent adult choic
[4800.32 - 4806.60] making decision not when you're 18 but
[4802.48 - 4809.84] at a much younger age wow H so now what
[4806.60 - 4812.48] happens is most of the fathers don't
[4809.84 - 4814.88] interfere and I think a lot of the
[4812.48 - 4817.12] mothers are also working so the
[4814.88 - 4820.96] conversations are not at the dinner
[4817.12 - 4824.20] table or at the lunch table anymore so
[4820.96 - 4827.20] the girl now is exposed to Media which
[4824.20 - 4830.12] says I need to have this Slim Trim
[4827.20 - 4831.92] figure and a lot of girls understand
[4830.12 - 4834.36] that by
[4831.92 - 4835.96] starvation you get there I get there and
[4834.36 - 4838.92] they stop eating so nutrition now
[4835.96 - 4841.24] suddenly drops and when they do eat
[4838.92 - 4843.36] they're eating from a craving
[4841.24 - 4845.80] perspective yeah and when you are
[4843.36 - 4847.40] stressed out research has already shown
[4845.80 - 4849.84] people who are stressed will gravitate
[4847.40 - 4852.36] to high fat and high sugar foods so now
[4849.84 - 4854.80] we come back into the whole behavioral
[4852.36 - 4857.48] mechanism when The Limited food choices
[4854.80 - 4861.36] in a week in a month in a year are
[4857.48 - 4863.52] bombarding your hormonal system yeah and
[4861.36 - 4865.80] coupled to the fact that we are so
[4863.52 - 4868.36] focused on academics in today's day and
[4865.80 - 4870.36] age for the woman to be contributing she
[4868.36 - 4873.00] has to lead she has to become
[4870.36 - 4876.04] powerful um you're focusing so much on
[4873.00 - 4878.44] academics physical activity is being
[4876.04 - 4881.28] lost so as a result you're putting on
[4878.44 - 4884.24] weight and I think by the time three
[4881.28 - 4889.00] years have gone 13 to 16 10th standard
[4884.24 - 4890.56] we have got that 5 8 kg fat gain and I
[4889.00 - 4893.16] think that's where the pcod condition
[4890.56 - 4895.12] begins to start flaring in and coming in
[4893.16 - 4898.64] and then we have the insecticides
[4895.12 - 4901.08] pesticides the pseudo estrogen molecules
[4898.64 - 4903.36] from Plastics from microwaving so I
[4901.08 - 4905.76] always tell people don't fry your food
[4903.36 - 4907.96] because trans fat goes and kues you so
[4905.76 - 4910.24] no fried food so I see teenagers look at
[4907.96 - 4913.44] me like not even me French fries I say
[4910.24 - 4917.00] specifically noten fries right and and
[4913.44 - 4920.28] so um I spend a lot of time educating
[4917.00 - 4922.56] the girl child that she needs to walk
[4920.28 - 4925.36] Walking is one of the best fat burning
[4922.56 - 4927.20] exercises uh because many girls have
[4925.36 - 4929.12] anemia and can't do these high-end
[4927.20 - 4930.44] sporting activities they're out of
[4929.12 - 4933.00] breath and then they say this is not for
[4930.44 - 4935.32] me whereas walking is a sustainable to
[4933.00 - 4939.20] do and then we're looking at elimination
[4935.32 - 4941.92] of the high glycemic index carbohydrates
[4939.20 - 4945.16] correct I don't say grainfree but I
[4941.92 - 4947.24] choose a more intelligent grain
[4945.16 - 4948.64] which could be based on if the parents
[4947.24 - 4951.56] give me a permission to do the food
[4948.64 - 4954.72] intolerance test if they don't what I do
[4951.56 - 4956.96] is I do a simple thing one week one week
[4954.72 - 4959.20] eat this grain this grain tell me how's
[4956.96 - 4961.44] your potty do you have gas does the wing
[4959.20 - 4963.84] scale go up so a lot of times we find
[4961.44 - 4966.52] out then people let's say for example
[4963.84 - 4969.52] eat only maida chapati or wheat chapati
[4966.52 - 4972.36] or whole wheat or quinoa or brown rice
[4969.52 - 4976.44] or ragi we begin to able to form a
[4972.36 - 4976.44] pattern so you're not against MAA
[4977.28 - 4983.20] anybody like you said no even a poison
[4979.88 - 4986.24] taken a little form is okay uh I'd like
[4983.20 - 4989.40] to behave like a judge when MAA comes in
[4986.24 - 4992.36] front of me I don't say guilty or I Let
[4989.40 - 4994.92] It Go free I ask what are you appearing
[4992.36 - 4999.40] before me as a petition so if it's a
[4994.92 - 5001.76] crossan you're in Paris enjoy it right
[4999.40 - 5003.84] but if every day we're going to sit in
[5001.76 - 5005.40] our clinic at 4:00 in the evening or
[5003.84 - 5007.48] we're in school pool coming out of the
[5005.40 - 5010.68] canteen and ordering those Cakes and
[5007.48 - 5012.88] Pastries or I'm having I have the choice
[5010.68 - 5015.00] to ask for a healthier
[5012.88 - 5017.24] rooty and I don't have the knowledge
[5015.00 - 5020.08] because the maida releases a sugar Spike
[5017.24 - 5022.00] immediately because of the refined flow
[5020.08 - 5024.92] and my my saliva mixes with and gives me
[5022.00 - 5028.04] this the pleasure sensation so then I'm
[5024.92 - 5029.72] like dude I got to educate you and
[5028.04 - 5033.64] therefore once you get educated you will
[5029.72 - 5035.68] realize that MAA without its fiber is
[5033.64 - 5038.92] going to be bad for you because it's a
[5035.68 - 5040.40] nuclear bomb getting into you yeah so
[5038.92 - 5044.36] when you put all of this together I
[5040.40 - 5048.36] think the pcod diet is driven more from
[5044.36 - 5051.60] behavioral consequences and lack of
[5048.36 - 5054.36] information on what to eat and how much
[5051.60 - 5056.44] to eat with the younger girls they're
[5054.36 - 5059.12] eating too little and with the girls who
[5056.44 - 5062.04] have now gone into college or their
[5059.12 - 5063.32] first job in college they're like kahang
[5062.04 - 5066.48] now my body is this way I can't do
[5063.32 - 5069.56] anything about it so there's this uh I
[5066.48 - 5072.04] don't care whatever attitude and they
[5069.56 - 5074.68] don't realize that um they could control
[5072.04 - 5077.76] it with the proper nutrition and then
[5074.68 - 5080.00] comes the uh I can't exercise either I
[5077.76 - 5082.84] don't have the schedule time it's not a
[5080.00 - 5084.88] belief in my family or I'm too body
[5082.84 - 5087.16] conscious to go out and work out because
[5084.88 - 5088.80] I'm getting trolled or shamed on the
[5087.16 - 5090.56] internet because I'm of a heavier weight
[5088.80 - 5092.84] so I sit in a counseling room and I hear
[5090.56 - 5095.60] all of this people break down and it's
[5092.84 - 5097.72] not about the diet it's it's about just
[5095.60 - 5101.28] that the Stig stigma associated with
[5097.72 - 5103.60] eating too much eating unscientifically
[5101.28 - 5106.68] or eating not at
[5103.60 - 5109.80] all and then when they get into this I
[5106.68 - 5111.84] work in my first job I've got a prove
[5109.80 - 5114.04] that I'm a girl I'm a woman in this
[5111.84 - 5117.36] workplace so I will work longer hours
[5114.04 - 5120.04] than anybody else let my food go for a
[5117.36 - 5122.60] toss and then I'm living in pgs I'm gone
[5120.04 - 5125.68] to this big city I'm no longer eating
[5122.60 - 5127.52] mamaka ka ka so the tiffen box is coming
[5125.68 - 5128.60] in so she's working really hard now
[5127.52 - 5131.08] she's stressed stress stressed she's
[5128.60 - 5132.48] trying to prove herself out and Doc you
[5131.08 - 5134.48] know better than anybody else as a
[5132.48 - 5136.12] doctor how stress affects your hormones
[5134.48 - 5137.72] so now you got another 3 4 cages of
[5136.12 - 5139.60] weight gain so what do we do now we have
[5137.72 - 5142.24] nutritional deficiencies we have the
[5139.60 - 5144.08] stresses so I'm drinking copious amounts
[5142.24 - 5146.40] of tea and coffee and suddenly because
[5144.08 - 5148.64] my brain needs that spot of energy I had
[5146.40 - 5151.48] two three teaspoons of sugar and so now
[5148.64 - 5153.80] the pcod rears itself even more and then
[5151.48 - 5155.72] we get another 3 4 kgs 5 kgs 10 kgs
[5153.80 - 5158.12] weight gain before you know this teenage
[5155.72 - 5161.04] girl who was of the right BMI is
[5158.12 - 5163.92] suddenly 20 kgs heavier and then she
[5161.04 - 5165.08] comes to marriageable age because she's
[5163.92 - 5168.92] going to get married and she wants to
[5165.08 - 5172.20] look good in that wedding gagra or gown
[5168.92 - 5174.52] stop she calls up Brian Fernando can I
[5172.20 - 5177.08] can I lose weight in 3 months and
[5174.52 - 5180.84] something that has taken almost 3 to 10
[5177.08 - 5183.92] years cannot be lost in in in 3 months
[5180.84 - 5186.48] so at that point you know you you look
[5183.92 - 5189.04] at this symptoms the skin little bit of
[5186.48 - 5191.04] hair or you just guess intelligently by
[5189.04 - 5193.04] looking at the homas score or the
[5191.04 - 5194.48] insulin resistance and the high average
[5193.04 - 5196.44] blood sugar levels they're like I think
[5194.48 - 5199.08] you should go and see a dermatologist
[5196.44 - 5200.28] you should go and see a gynecologist
[5199.08 - 5201.40] these two doctors you have to be because
[5200.28 - 5203.08] you're going to be getting married so
[5201.40 - 5205.20] you want beautiful skin and you want to
[5203.08 - 5206.96] know that all your female reproductive
[5205.20 - 5208.92] system is in the right place and then
[5206.96 - 5210.16] suddenly they get this thing about pcod
[5208.92 - 5212.60] like hitting them so that's another
[5210.16 - 5215.32] place we diagnose it and then the last
[5212.60 - 5218.00] stage is where uh you know trying for
[5215.32 - 5220.28] kids kids yeah and that's where it's not
[5218.00 - 5225.00] detected till now which is the skinny PC
[5220.28 - 5227.68] in fact when I married my wife um we we
[5225.00 - 5230.16] had a we had a late marriage both of us
[5227.68 - 5231.36] and my mother-in-law is a gynecologist
[5230.16 - 5232.92] and the moment we got married the first
[5231.36 - 5235.00] thing my mom mom-in-law said to me he
[5232.92 - 5236.48] like don't delay you have to have make
[5235.00 - 5237.96] babies immediately and I was like we
[5236.48 - 5242.00] just got married to each other and stuff
[5237.96 - 5244.44] like that and um my wife says I have
[5242.00 - 5246.48] pcod and I knew the condition and
[5244.44 - 5248.08] everything I says don't worry about it
[5246.48 - 5250.00] and um I remember my mother-in-law
[5248.08 - 5252.20] saying is you start fertility treatment
[5250.00 - 5255.32] right now itself I was like no we want
[5252.20 - 5258.36] do it let's get into diet so my personal
[5255.32 - 5261.88] experience is that pcod is a reversible
[5258.36 - 5264.44] condition completely and nutrition is
[5261.88 - 5267.16] tantamount because you can take all the
[5264.44 - 5269.36] hormones medication do all the high-end
[5267.16 - 5272.36] weight training and exercise and run
[5269.36 - 5274.84] marathons but if you want that ovary to
[5272.36 - 5277.36] reset itself get rid of those SP as I
[5274.84 - 5279.24] call it you got to go with nutrition so
[5277.36 - 5283.08] true so true Dr
[5279.24 - 5285.56] Rashmi you are the skin goddess the guru
[5283.08 - 5287.88] the teacher the doctor my God I am the
[5285.56 - 5290.28] nutritionist yes your domain is skin
[5287.88 - 5293.64] care my domain is nutrition
[5290.28 - 5296.44] care I will choose five things that
[5293.64 - 5299.40] everybody out there needs to do for
[5296.44 - 5302.28] better skin wow what are the five things
[5299.40 - 5303.88] that you say are the top priority for
[5302.28 - 5304.64] them to do for their skin so you go
[5303.88 - 5306.72] first
[5304.64 - 5308.52] so the five points for skin which is
[5306.72 - 5310.24] super important one of course the first
[5308.52 - 5311.72] one is skin care which is the four
[5310.24 - 5313.96] pillars that we discussed earlier so
[5311.72 - 5315.72] start with a good skincare better you go
[5313.96 - 5319.12] to a dermatologist understand your skin
[5315.72 - 5321.72] and start that most important number two
[5319.12 - 5323.36] visit Ryan understand what is nutrition
[5321.72 - 5326.00] because like we said before what you put
[5323.36 - 5328.08] in is what shows on the skin very
[5326.00 - 5330.08] important people think that you go to a
[5328.08 - 5331.52] nutrition only when you're either obese
[5330.08 - 5333.40] or you want to put on weight either want
[5331.52 - 5334.72] to lose or put on weight for me just go
[5333.40 - 5336.60] to a nutrition
[5334.72 - 5338.60] in general to understand what you should
[5336.60 - 5340.72] eat understand the healthy food so
[5338.60 - 5343.68] that's one thing third very important
[5340.72 - 5345.40] thing is mobility so exercise whichever
[5343.68 - 5346.72] is yours whether if it is sports if
[5345.40 - 5349.16] you're a young kid you don't have to do
[5346.72 - 5352.44] an walking and running and gyming you do
[5349.16 - 5355.96] Sports Mobility see how you expend the
[5352.44 - 5359.04] energy that you're putting in um fourth
[5355.96 - 5361.00] is a lot of hydration to the skin so
[5359.04 - 5363.08] again excessive water drinking will only
[5361.00 - 5364.76] drain out the nutrition so you need to
[5363.08 - 5366.60] know exactly what is the hydration
[5364.76 - 5368.32] you're taking in how's your lifestyle
[5366.60 - 5372.80] and how you consume
[5368.32 - 5375.24] that um what could the fifth one be I am
[5372.80 - 5377.24] thinking don't self-medicate is the
[5375.24 - 5378.88] fifth one I would think actives don't
[5377.24 - 5381.08] overdo the actives a lot of them are
[5378.88 - 5383.20] looking at internet don't don't self
[5381.08 - 5384.92] don't self-prescribe and so many actives
[5383.20 - 5387.28] you putting in on the skin first because
[5384.92 - 5389.48] you can't undo some of the damage yeah
[5387.28 - 5392.24] okay so go there f one that's it so the
[5389.48 - 5395.40] fifth one is too many actives getting
[5392.24 - 5397.76] educated online Internet self- education
[5395.40 - 5400.72] and putting in the actives which might
[5397.76 - 5402.08] actually lead to long-term damage maybe
[5400.72 - 5403.80] difficult even for a Derm to then
[5402.08 - 5405.40] corrected it's not everything cannot be
[5403.80 - 5406.88] raised yeah you don't paint your house
[5405.40 - 5409.16] today you don't service your own mobile
[5406.88 - 5411.24] or your car yourself but uh you know
[5409.16 - 5413.16] your diet and your skin everyone want
[5411.24 - 5414.28] every everyone's Everyone's an expert on
[5413.16 - 5415.60] it and the best part is they come to
[5414.28 - 5416.52] your clinic and they say they've done
[5415.60 - 5418.88] our
[5416.52 - 5421.80] research from
[5418.88 - 5424.72] where why did I study so many
[5421.80 - 5430.32] years so now these were my five points
[5424.72 - 5433.28] what yours my first point is walking ah
[5430.32 - 5435.84] most of India has a heavier BMI
[5433.28 - 5437.96] especially Urban India walking is one of
[5435.84 - 5439.32] the best fat burning exercises on the
[5437.96 - 5441.80] planet in fact yesterday I found
[5439.32 - 5443.24] somebody running in the gym and I went
[5441.80 - 5445.64] up to her and I says ma'am what's your
[5443.24 - 5448.60] goal and she said I want to lose 5 cges
[5445.64 - 5451.48] of fat I said walk because when you walk
[5448.60 - 5454.36] your heart rate is in a Zone wherein
[5451.48 - 5457.64] your substrate utilization of energy is
[5454.36 - 5459.92] 70% from fat and 30% from carbohydrate
[5457.64 - 5462.28] when you run you utilize more of your
[5459.92 - 5464.36] muscle glycogen which is carbohydrate so
[5462.28 - 5466.16] the first thing for great skincare and
[5464.36 - 5468.92] you also agreed with me that people when
[5466.16 - 5471.00] they run yeah the face get does get
[5468.92 - 5473.24] affected to a certain extent from an
[5471.00 - 5475.44] aging point of view now there's two
[5473.24 - 5477.80] things in a runner's face if you're
[5475.44 - 5480.48] running and you're running at a certain
[5477.80 - 5483.24] pace and you're not running every day
[5480.48 - 5485.04] like a marathon runner and you're of an
[5483.24 - 5487.52] Optimum weight weight then that'll give
[5485.04 - 5489.08] you that glow that fresh blood into your
[5487.52 - 5491.96] face that little flushing and make you
[5489.08 - 5494.12] feel lovely while it can be the other
[5491.96 - 5496.40] edge of the sword where you've run so
[5494.12 - 5498.64] much you're so lean right now and you're
[5496.40 - 5501.08] at an age where the face can go fully
[5498.64 - 5503.96] gaunt so that's called as a runner's
[5501.08 - 5507.48] phase in a not so positive way so you
[5503.96 - 5509.76] need to be very careful which age how is
[5507.48 - 5512.48] your skin how is your bony structure
[5509.76 - 5514.36] when you really decide to run to be that
[5512.48 - 5515.76] lean which is why I'm going to be now
[5514.36 - 5517.88] walking like
[5515.76 - 5520.00] this because I'm going to get fat
[5517.88 - 5521.52] burning it's going to be good on my skin
[5520.00 - 5523.92] and I'm not going to get the gaunt look
[5521.52 - 5525.64] but you see you have a very lovely bony
[5523.92 - 5528.16] structure of the face so you will never
[5525.64 - 5530.28] age badly and you have a very lean face
[5528.16 - 5532.28] I'm sure you being the nutritionist have
[5530.28 - 5534.80] the exact fat percentage which is right
[5532.28 - 5535.88] not low I know you may never have high
[5534.80 - 5538.28] because you're the nutritionist but you
[5535.88 - 5541.32] won't even have it low so that keeps
[5538.28 - 5543.92] your skin nice and three your acne has
[5541.32 - 5545.72] been your blessing the scars because of
[5543.92 - 5547.96] of the acne is actually holding your
[5545.72 - 5550.56] skin tight and not kind of letting it go
[5547.96 - 5553.32] down and scarred tissue has so much
[5550.56 - 5555.28] collagen elastin and Scar Tissue it just
[5553.32 - 5557.72] holds the skin there doctor I feel like
[5555.28 - 5559.56] taking you for an ice cream though I
[5557.72 - 5561.20] would say I can't give an ice cream but
[5559.56 - 5562.40] that's what I do let's go get some sugar
[5561.20 - 5566.40] that's the best news I heard this
[5562.40 - 5569.68] Century but my second tip of nutrition
[5566.40 - 5573.24] uh would be hydration yes um and and not
[5569.68 - 5575.56] only because the skin but 70% of the
[5573.24 - 5577.56] human body is made up of water the brain
[5575.56 - 5579.48] has water the kidneys have water skin
[5577.56 - 5582.28] has water everything has water so I am
[5579.48 - 5584.32] very focused on people hydrating more
[5582.28 - 5587.12] responsibly and in today's world
[5584.32 - 5589.88] everyone wants to not have plain water
[5587.12 - 5592.60] they want to have something
[5589.88 - 5594.44] beverages uh if he rewound 1,000 years
[5592.60 - 5596.36] there were no beverages bages we just
[5594.44 - 5598.84] drank water so I think that would be my
[5596.36 - 5601.60] second tip bring water back as a
[5598.84 - 5603.84] fashionable element into your body third
[5601.60 - 5605.56] would be as you said you would take to
[5603.84 - 5609.16] your Island
[5605.56 - 5611.48] vegetables fruits are my fourth between
[5609.16 - 5614.20] these two if you're looking for weight
[5611.48 - 5617.08] loss I'm looking at vegetables being my
[5614.20 - 5619.16] best friend and fruits is like your side
[5617.08 - 5621.08] friend okay yeah but if you're looking
[5619.16 - 5622.68] at weight gain then I would say hey get
[5621.08 - 5626.04] a little bit more of the fruits as your
[5622.68 - 5629.32] as your best friend the final point over
[5626.04 - 5631.12] here is I would and I be I might be
[5629.32 - 5634.64] trolled a lot for this is I would look
[5631.12 - 5638.00] at the grain control better g r a i n
[5634.64 - 5641.04] mhm you see you and I today are DJs
[5638.00 - 5643.60] what's that Dash jockies okay right so
[5641.04 - 5646.64] our ancestors moved and walked and
[5643.60 - 5649.44] worked a lot so their calorie
[5646.64 - 5651.20] requirement was very high so which
[5649.44 - 5653.04] element in the food chain gives us
[5651.20 - 5656.84] higher calories it is the carbohydrates
[5653.04 - 5658.88] and fat now fat technically comes in the
[5656.84 - 5661.80] added fat from our vegetable oils and
[5658.88 - 5664.32] all so I tell people that's a given to
[5661.80 - 5667.32] reduce but carbohydrates because we
[5664.32 - 5670.84] brought up by our ancestors our dadis
[5667.32 - 5672.88] and our our mothers we want to eat more
[5670.84 - 5674.88] of grein we are taught to eat more of
[5672.88 - 5677.68] grain India is a culture where we
[5674.88 - 5680.88] celebrate food as an expression of love
[5677.68 - 5683.60] so if I can reduce the grain or improve
[5680.88 - 5688.04] the grain so white rice maybe get brown
[5683.60 - 5691.36] rice red rice if there is uh U wheat go
[5688.04 - 5693.72] towards the old kamut wheat or kle wheat
[5691.36 - 5695.68] uh if you're Gluten Sensitive then go to
[5693.72 - 5699.00] the gluten-free grains everything from
[5695.68 - 5700.92] joar bajra ragi Aman but again check
[5699.00 - 5703.44] your bio individuality like I'm allergic
[5700.92 - 5704.88] to ragi even though ra even ragi is a
[5703.44 - 5707.08] great game because when I have ragi I
[5704.88 - 5709.00] get lose motion so I've got a hyper
[5707.08 - 5712.68] sensitive gut but there are few things
[5709.00 - 5715.72] like kinab bakat koutu my stomach likes
[5712.68 - 5718.04] so my advice to people is begin to
[5715.72 - 5720.56] understand that your body is the most
[5718.04 - 5722.64] expensive real estate you keep saying
[5720.56 - 5724.44] that yeah right and are we living in it
[5722.64 - 5728.24] as a landlord
[5724.44 - 5730.44] or as a tenant and to me you are like uh
[5728.24 - 5732.72] when like you would be like my nutrition

[5732.72 - 5737.96] house needs to be constructed it's the
