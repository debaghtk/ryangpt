contractor uh dr ashish is the head of department director of the cardiac exercise and car exercise rehabilitation and sports medicine in ancient reliance hospital in mumbai uh dr ashish i've known him for many years now and i met him at a at a seminar and we we keep bumping into each other whenever i visit bombay go and say hi to him he's a gentleman that has worked with dr manmohan singh when he had his cardiac issues he's written the book called the heart truth and he's a big shot in the world of people who have cardiac problems and he tells you to exercise so i'm bringing him on a chit chat for 15 20 minutes where you can ask him a few questions um he's a very very busy man i i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and i said i i need i need a new year's blessings and um he was like yeah let's do let's do it on on on the 1st of jan and i have another very special friend of mine shweta ambry shetty who is a celebrity in her own right in the fitness world she's one of the co-founders at cult fit and culfit is leading the fitness revolution in india bringing in online fitness to you via their app you must have been to a cult fit center and i'm sure many of you are thinking of registering and you know basically um joining a gym um so she's gonna be there so three of us are gonna bang our heads on what are the hacks in 2022 so this is a test right now to see if it's going live so middle if you're testing this out we need to get these backgrounds checked um a tip to anyone who's watching this right now because i can't see it right now it's custom streaming live from the zoom to linkedin and facebook a tip if you breathe through your right nostril that activates your heart adrenal and basically warms up the body so if you get up in the morning you want to kind of focus on okay my nose is blocked today because i think i ate gluten so i'm not supposed to eat gluten and i ate a cake and so i'm suffering the consequence of more mucus secretion so i got i got my one nostril block my left is clear now if you bury through your left it calms the body down so towards the evening after a very aggressive day at work and all you want to take a breath through your left nostril and i'm working with my yoga guru arjun lal and he's gifted me this book called breath by james nestor you got to get that book it's like really really amazing it'll change your life in terms of the way you breathe and you have to have about 5.5 breaths per minute so it's it's literally like you know you're breathing in very very slowly and uh i've been experimenting with this uh on the garment and checking my heart rate as i worked out i did it actually today just came in for my workout and i found that my heart rate variability between the peak of a 155 and then i finish a set and then i do the structured breathing only through the nose was like amazing um amazing to the extent there was this research done and that's what motivated me to start in the gym sealing up my lips so seal up my look and breathe only through the nose and why am i going to be talking about this on the first of january because all your fat burning doesn't happen from your diet it happens from breathing and when you walk you breathe at a rate which is so amazingly slow as compared to when you're running on a treadmill so i want to bring up a new concept to everyone and i want you to try this out i want to try it for three months get your fat percentage get your resting heart rate breathe through your nose the research that convinced me to do this is this this guy i forgot the name of the doctor he put everyone on a treadmill cyclist on a cycling treadmill or whatever it's called and he told them breathe through your mouth so they con they covered a certain distance in 44 breath holy threw them out and then he told them the next day breathe only through your nose the cyclists covered the same distance in 14 breaths so that was an amazing piece of information for me to receive because if i want to get a hack done in 2022 for my body and i'm going to be talking to dr ashish contractor and shwetambri about what they do in fitness and what they do in cardiac cardiovascular efficiency we're going to get different schools of thought but at the end of the day i want you to be able to ask the questions to the experts so join us on first of january at 5 pm i chose 5 p.m because if you're partying the previous day you'll probably have a hangover 5 pm get a cup of tea get a cup of uh green tea or chamomile tea sit down we're going to be going for six hours sorry about six hours till 6 pm you can see that the gym workout is um screwing with my my neurons in my head i'm not able to focus uh whatever you're doing let me know in this testing life rudolph let this test live run on my profile let people understand that they can send me comments on what are they planning for the new years tell me what you're going to be doing for the new year other than attending a lecture which is going to change the way you design 2022 for you all right god bless you have a great evening ahead and i'm going to go and get some sleep my heart rate has actually gone up i need to
