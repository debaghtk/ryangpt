Transcript: hey guys if you're not able to watch my long form content of podcast here are some short form clips for you to enjoy but I've never asked you this question why did you get into this world of being a fitness influencer Guru and even having a world-class business about it so what's the story where did it start it actually started u quite early uh when I was growing up uh we were living in a joint family and my dad's younger brother used to be a great table tennis player we had a table at home and every day in the evening some 15 20 office friends would come home and the vibe used to be once again 15 20 people would come into your house to play table tennis they would play for 3 to four hours right and all the kids would be watching this yeah all the kids would be watching and playing also so we had no option than to you know just pick up the B bat and play because playing a sport was so glamorized uh back in the days in my house so that is where it actually started and table tennis is a fast sport requires a lot of agility and things like that so it started there I picked up table tennis so my fitness journey started with playing a sport and then uh uh because I had an opportunity of playing with people at home there were many good players who were coming to my house so I just got into playing table tennis well and was the icsc champion at some point very early uh in my school days then later I picked up basketball uh loved that sport played that for many years in Junior School uh so for many many years I was just playing sports what also happened I started lifting weights around the age of 14 and that was a very different story so I was a very skinny kid uh and because of that I was subject to bullying and a lot of body shaming and uh you know all kind of unpleasant experiences especially to do with how you look so I wasn't very happy about where was this which part of India uh I I'm from North India I was born in Agra uh I studied in part in nital partly in theun a little bit in Agra so it was all in all those places uh so quite a bit of uh you know un Pleasant experiences happened and uh someone told me that if you go and start lifting weights it'll probably help you bulk up uh because that's what happens and it'll maybe help you in what you want to achieve so what is the starting point in this lifting weights like it was on small dingy gym in the school or in the city or something like that yeah so it was a very small uh very small gym in the city in in derun and my my first experience at the gym was quite bad so I went I was very skinny I had a lot of experience in playing a sport but lifting weights nowhere close to uh doing that and in the first session uh the trainer pushed me quite hard and I couldn't I didn't know how to lift weights so I just couldn't do it very well and at the end of the session he told me it hurt my ego the next day I was so sore that I also got a fever I'm sensing I'm sensing you know if you go back in your time capsule this is where when you decided to start your fitness journey this thought was in your head don't over push people in their first workout exactly so this trainer over pushed you and then what happened then I was uh I just couldn't whatever he was asking me to do I couldn't do that much so he just told me this is not for you uh not in a very rude way it did hurt my ego uh went home wasn't very happy about it next day I got fever because of so excessive s Ness and excessive fatigue and then I thought maybe lifting weights is not for me done but then at some point later another 6 or 7 months or so my brother my younger brother who still works with me uh he told me just give it one more shot so there was another gym called Power Pack gym in in theun and we've walked into that gym uh it was 400 rupe a month of membership very expensive for me at that point uh then I thought Let It Be anyways this is not for me I've been told he said no let let's do it let's let's give it one more shot okay and then I started going to the gym the first day I walked in saw a bunch of bulky very muscular guys guys I was intimidated but then all of them were so helpful they taught me you know how to go about you were still about 14 15 years of age I was still 14 14 years of age to be precise uh they were like very helpful they you know taught me the right kind of movements they also told me not to go crazy about it they told me a little bit about uh nutrition at that time I mean nutrition advices were just flowing uh a little all over the place but whatever they knew they were helping me out with it what I took away from it is just eat a lot of food so I did that I lifted weights and I started bulking up all of that happened uh and throughout so many years I've been through those journeys of gaining weight losing weight and all of that has happened with me but that is not important what is important is that weightlifting was something that came as magical to me actually a personal transformation experience not from the point of view of how I look but from the point of view of how I feel and then I decided that I'm never going back this is something hey guys
