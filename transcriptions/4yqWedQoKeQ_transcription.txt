Transcript: to be what Comfort level are you at mentally physically and therefore your brain is much more productive in the workplace that makes sense so your feet are going to be like I'm because my feet my feet are hurting me yeah I wish wear shoes okay we can always knock off our shoes I think no nobody would mind but so you worked with all prominent celebrities who's who's of the country and you know even individuals High net worth individuals um what are some impactful stories that you might want to share about things you know that people should do again maybe not hinting towards theka specifically but generally you know all sort of people you work with certain impactful stories from where we could all draw parallels so about four or five years so before I um before the world found out who Ryan Fernando was I'd already done at least 100 celebrities so the addition of the title celebrity nutritionist was to create a marketing front because how do you convince individuals personally to take care of the health so you have the celebrities so the first story is why do these celebrities invest or these sports stars invest in their body or their diet or their healthare obviously their paycheck comes from what they do so they need to look good they need to shoot at odd hours they need to have that killer energy they take multiple takes for 18 hours a day now you replace a celebrity and put each one of the HR heads over here as a celebrity you still work for a paycheck you're an Olympian in the office space and everyone who reports into you in in your company and I don't want to do this in a public forum but I'd be very interested to see how many startup Founders are sitting here in this forum the HR is always there to take care of the employee but does the guy who builds the company have the bandwidth to say that I'm the Shah ruk Khan of my life and the organization that I'm building everybody in that is a mini Shah ruk Khan so the story starts with I think everyone's a celebrity in their own life they just haven't learned it and in today's Forum I think it's a responsibility for HR to treat your employee like a rockstar but not give them too many benef benefits ask them to earn those benefits because when they earn the benefit they feel really good about it so the story goes like this okay um there was this gentleman um who was 72 years of age right and the perspective is I'll break it down for HR to convince your employees to bring in or your CEO or your CFO to bring in more Moola into the workplace to take care of employees so there was this gentleman 70y old he stands in the wing scale in my clinic his body age on the weighing scale is 75 now each one of you can come to my clinic here in Bangalore anywhere in India you'll stand on a weighing scale you have your birth certificate age which is your driving license age and then you have a metabolic age biological age you stand on the wing scale so this guy was 75 but he was actually 72 years on driving license now with diabetes hypertension and this could be a 30-year-old in your organization this could be a 40y old in your organization this person stands on the wing skill and suddenly discovers they're 5 years older 5 years is okay but after 1 year of exercise that 15 minutes of gardening correct nutrition his body age came down by 10 years wow next lialia got this massive gift hamper from his son why he says Papa earns consultancy fee of 1 CR per year Papa now is 10 years younger I am 10 Crowes richer are you getting the perspective now you're laughing what if that's you what is your net worth today as a celebrity what is the net worth of your employee today and as they grow older like I've got my team over here and I'm doing breath work for them I'm getting them gym membership because if they are younger the organization laughs all the way way to the bank because you know all the studies out there say productivity Works enhancement loss of Manpower days is lesser the million dooll question is how do we get them to think like vat kohi that's a very interesting perspective any funny stories around something you want to share maybe you know take giving us the lesson of you know things that we shouldn't do so funny stories there are so many right um one of the funny stories happened in in in in a in a scenario of the corporate world so we were contracted by this Fortune 500 company so this is not the clinic okay so Clinic we are not there 24 bar7 so you walk into our clinic and we know you only for 1 hour but when we are embedded in as a clinic inside a corporate we are sitting there with the employees okay so one of the funny stories was um uh there was this organization we did a survey and and um one of the employees came in is like please get my boss to come in here so we were like why my boss is always angry first thing in the morning so I was like why is your boss angry in the we don't know the whole team just thinks he's angry there must be something in diet you can do now background story is whilst all of this is happening we were there for 6 months we did a survey and one of the tick Mark top tick marks of the symptoms that people wanted to improve want to take a guesser no constipation sense so so bear with me okay the funny story is coming in so think about it everyone if you are jacked up backed up early morning and you walk into the office at 11:00 a.m. and your entire team is there and you have not offloaded you're going to offload on somebody right so the the whole point over here was when we did that there was like 67 of the 100 survey who said constipation was one of the top three and when we did the survey 6 months later so the realization was that um the funny part is that sometimes people don't understand that um human emotions productivity are all linked to how you feel and uh there this there's a beautiful book that was recommended to me in another HR it's called dying uh dying for a paycheck uh you should read it if you're in planning HR in your organization and health benefits I want to read just one line from this it's got It's it's not funny but it's the context of where we taking this discussion so that we understand how we cannot have uh we can have more joyous bosses bosses with you know give you a better rating and and stuff like that so people compensate for the psychological depletion I repeat people compensate for psychological depletion of energy from a stressful work environment by Ting so when you have a boss who's backed up not taken a dump oh by the way this boss uh became very cheerful by 4:00 in the afternoon so you understand that there was a bowel M somewhere between 1 and 3:00 okay so yeah nutrition I mean nobody would discuss bowel movement except a nutritionist but the funny part over here is the rest of the team would ovat because they got yelling at 11: to 3:00 so they would order the from the e-commerce apps the most unhealthy stuff so while the boss is angry the team is sad the team is anxiety the team is demotivation and they also gaining weight and they you basically so it's very easy to say hey boss I need you to do a diet and employees are like they can be stressful to HR like oh you want to control my paycheck you want to control my K now you want to control my diet also so please understand that Wellness also comes from a perspective where employees think you're infringing on their privacy so it it goes both ways you have an angry boss but you could also have an angry employee for you needling in that so long story short I think a lot of a lot more people in that organization got happier because we moved coolers to the workplace because they were like at one end of the corridor on this 10,000 s ft so just had three coolers second is we got personalized water bottles done and then when we told them that they had to drink two of those bottles and they were like dude I'm not even drinking one bottle and because they were not drinking enough of water they were less water but do you know that AC's dehydrate employees so you dehydrate but where will you pull out the water from the food that is digesting in you contains water so when you're pulling out the water which goes out in your breath your poop is just going to get more stuck up right and hence an angry boss first thing in the morning so if you have that angry boss bring bananas to work when you go to meet your boss say boss would you like a glass of water okay so this is stuff that you could do it's a weird domino effect of not one lesson we take away from that is do as managers we shouldn't forget to offload in the morning so there's another part to this which is and I like to talk about nutrition on the constipation part the world thinks that everyone should dump first thing in the morning that's wrong there are different types of people on the planet there are any any part of the Poopers there is evening Poopers there's afternoon Poopers it's absolutely normal so if your parents made you feel guilty about not having an early morning dump rest ass short briyan Fernando says you can be that angry boss but just make sure you add more fiber and water in your diet all right switching away from that uh we'll talk more I can see he's uncomfortable regarding more designing Wellness programs for the organization because that's what we're here for I mean that was a good transition uh but see when you know as HR is the key you know stakeholders over here when they're designing a wellness program for an organization they need to keep a lot of things in their mind so it's not just you know uh as individual celebrity nutritionist you might be working you know at one one particular person at a time but you know when you're implementing an organization wide uh wellness program for example or a nutrition program you need to keep a lot of people you need to keep a certain scale in mind right so you need to have certain sort of template or framework that you can replicate on different you know individuals so how would you what suggestions would you give to the HR audience HR people in the audience over here so it's a tough task to get for HR to get people motivated in today's day and age um so just bear with me on this what I believe I've I've been sitting in a chair like this for about 15 years now as a nutritionist in forums where he talk to HR managers it has changed postco people are more ready to take care of their health so the starting point is that blood test that we do the mentioned right at the beginning there's a blood test when the guy comes in put a gun to his head are you worthy to enter my organization cholesterol tick liver profile tick kidney profile tick okay come into the company but after you come into the company the blood test is voluntary the word voluntary and I I'll share with you the secret here there are two types of people in the world there is the pain and the vein you've got to you've got to identify in your organization who are the pain not giving pain but people wait till they get diabetes hypertension sugar problem and then the way who want to behave like verat Koh or Anushka Sharma kind of thing that they will take care of themselves because that's how they think very easy to find such people the person whose desk is very clean in an office is a vanity person right that's a person who would do the oh this is my blood test what should I do now but a persons whose desk is completely cluttered and blah blah blah whatever they going to have to work at a different frequency their frequency is more and more awareness and so how do you build that awareness you build that awareness not by feeding them information in my opinion you just make them the celebrity of their life when people come out of college their self net worth is very low if you ask me you need as HR to raise that level that this person is a very valuable contributor and I I have one tagline which I use which is which I've asked to be put up over here you give this tagline to anyone and ask them to keychain it onto their desk or keep it and every time you see it my and you don't use the word ah you just say my body is the most expensive real estate after that I will ever your own you can change your car you can change your mobile you can change your laptop you can change your house you can change your job you can change your spouse you can't change your parents and you can't change your sibling okay bear with me what's my point over here your body is the most non-changeable asset so you got to make employees realize that that even you as a company and you as an HR are the transitionary vector to enabling this person to come to Greatness bear with me in the final Point AI is coming AI is going to go at the fifth level if you have read Sam alman's blog he writes the different five levels of AI the fifth level is organizational implementation of AI meaning AI will create organizations on its own who are going to be the most valuable assets then people so let's say you join a company and I'm an entrepreneur and I say please come join me you're going to be offering I'm giving you ergonomic chairs I'm giving you this I'm giving you blood tests I'm giving you that I'm giving you everything I'm giving you a salary you're just going to look through the employee and say what about me which is the most valuable real estate so if you can begin to Market that to your employee that you are the most valuable estate that you own we are not saying it you say it now what do you want to do and what do you want us to help you out with and obviously you have a budget right ask the person what they want to do with that budget and out of 100 people five will volunteer 95 will not but when you create a culture over a period of time and it'll take 10 15 years to move an entire organization to healthier or as people move from 25 to 35 35 to 45 as they grow in the age category and the weight category they're going to figure it out that's what they want to do all right so basically when we're designing a wellness program a lot of times we keep this particular metric in mind or you know an impact in mind that maybe it should increase our productivity or my people's productivity in a lot of ways because you know you want to show a measurable or or an impact that you know you can probably brag about you know this was the impact that was created by my wellness program what do you suggest you know should be the key components of a wellness program if productivity is one of the major you know driving factors behind it so there are a lot of metrics in this book which talk about Employee Engagement and employee productivity the first question is does an employee think that your measure of productivity is democratic enough for them so a lot of times people feel that the measurements are skewed from a wellness perspective perspective I'll give you I'll give you a simple perspective of an organization US prisons okay now please don't troll me on the internet tomorrow if you're loading this I'm not comparing uh the the the organization to us prison but there was extreme amount of violence anxiety and suicides in American prisons so they divided this prison block into two parts one block they brought in this organizational change which was changing the nutrition bringing breath work meditation they found something like a 60 plus% drop in gang wars suicides deaths in the prison so that's extreme human behavior somebody's incarcerated we have organizations it's not a prison but many employees feel oh yeah I'm working 9 to5 I'm in a prison I would like to motivate people to say that if you have a job in today's day and age embrace it the universe is giving you a sense of purpose the moment you Embrace that sense of purpose your metrics in the wellness program is how can I improve my productivity very simple behave like an Olympic Athlete simple what does an Olympic Athlete do sir this is your fat percentage this is your muscle perent okay what is my viseral fat so much oh so much visal fat what should I start doing let me improve my visceral fat how has visceral fat got anything to do with productivity in the workplace everything if a person is taking statins because of cholesterol do you know that they are more tired because of statins how many 30 year olds do you know in your organization are taking statins and you meet my media team they are rock stars absolute rock stars why because they in that environment of constant so you need to find brand ambassadors or recruit people in their CVS who say they are in sports they're in Zumba they're in Pilatus they're in Gym training and Seed them in that part when you're recruiting it I've got a techy guy who goes to the gym I'm like dude where you no no no in the in the entire College out of 100 students I was the five of us to go to the gym I saw that in a CV I want you in my company so employee productivity definitely goes up with nutrition I'll give you a simple point there was a a study done on school children uh given I don't remember how many walnuts a day but the productivity in in math test scores went up by 11% now if you run a finance company wouldn't you want all your accountants to be eating walnuts right now the question question is does HR give the walnuts or does the employee buy the walnuts you need to figure out the motivational part and the awareness part leave the rest of the employee India is moving in that direction India is the largest population in the world with the youngest Workforce in the world but we will become this not we will we are the sickest population in the world Food For Thought HR has a seismic responsibility in preventing this young largest Workforce moving into the sick part and it doesn't start at the age of 45 plus when I'm vice president and getting all those spks and benefits it starts at that 25 to 35 year of age group and all of those guys say hey Ryan Fernando what do you want to do diet man let's go to Goan party your state anyway gives alcohol so cheap so you've got to begin to involve people in hiking trekking offs sites which are more Fitness incline change the awareness and cafeterias I've gone to cafeterias a simple thing like a tent card saying that this bowl is 100 G of rice is so many calories and is equivalent to 45 minutes of walking we did this in an organization and the Katra actually said Sab rice consumption in 6 weeks simple awareness the metrics is just letting your employee get more and more and the enthusiasm of HR is always to kind of give a lot of information so now you have sleep information exercise information nutrition information psychological information doctor's information then the employee feels overwhelmed so you need to have a calendar that Paces that out you know so transitioning on the cafeteria topic I know a lot of people here might be responsible in designing cafeteria menus or you incorporating healthy eating options over there how do you uh suggest you know with the vegetarian nonvegetarian even vegan options coming in or the people preferring to be vegan at least the younger audience how do you sort of you know suggest them to be more inclusive when it comes to different food orientation um that's a that's a huge problem I ran a business called itifen where we provided healthy meals to people it it shut down because of this problem cuz the vegan comes in like why aren't you so serving vegan food vegetarian like I can't eat in that kitchen where non-v food is also prepared right so you have all of these problems and you will go through these problems when I run my company the simplest uh thought process as a nutritionist is this keep educating them on the basic premise which is what's the calorie I need per day what is the timing of the day that I'm eating that calorie then break down the protein carbs and fats and then tell them vegetarian non-v the mistake we make is first decide vegetarian Nonet in vegan and when you lead from that you're bound to trip up because you're telling the person I'm coming with cultural differentiation in the organization no you just say that hey this is the veg Buffet that's the non-v buffet these are the options available and here we got one vegan option over a period of time you will realize that 90% of the employees below below the age of 95 eat with taste buds they're not worried about their health but if you start that blood test so I work with this Japanese screening firm called nura and they had about 100 employees screen I can't take the name of the company and uh it's a Japanese company that got screen from Hyderabad and they screened everybody and they gave the visal fat the 100 employees next year came back again Cent percent all the 100 employees knew what was visceral fat they knew in the previous year that their visceral fat was gun to my head above 100 square cm they said nobody had ever told us about this metrics they all volunt started changing their food and their exercise so when you're in the workplace you got to figure out what percentage of your population is in this direction am I ready to do this so if you have 80% of your population in Workforce wanting to be healthy get inclusive if 80% are like by Dal chavel don't go in that version go with the reverse which is the blood test which is the exercise test offsite maybe people are doing great stuff like how long can you dance for you know on one foot this fun stuff you got to make people realize over Milestones that they are healthy or unhealthy all right so yeah this is more on a personal or a that sort of a thing on a very specific question coffee what are your thoughts because a lot of people in especially in cooporate work spaces rely and run on coffee when they have to go from meetings to meetings or you know SL longer hours and I I think uh so coffee is good if you do the gene test which we do in our Clinic you have coffee positive receptor people and po coffee negative receptor people so I'm a negative receptor so maximum I can do two cups of coffee a day anything more than that activates my blood pressure and stroke risk there are people who are positive receptors who can drink six seven cups of coffee a day now here's the issue number one caffeine is known to boost mental alertness are you not mentally alert because your diet is bad you have diabetes hypertension cholesterol in the background you didn't eat a nutritious breakfast a simple thing I will tell you is um I had a film star sister called me up yesterday she says I've got a thank you you did this test that test I have stopped craving sugar for the first time in 25 years of my life what magic have you done I said nothing we just did your testing you are XYZ deficiency you had too much of this bacteria in your gut you're not supposed to eat rice it's like huh but but but I said no buts this is your blueprint so the coffee blueprint is very simple we are consuming more tea and coffee because India is eating less nutritiously India is coming to the Metros and is away from mama papa and D daddy Nana Nani who would prepare tiffen box and give it to you so those of you who live with your parents you are still very lucky because you will carry a tiffen box which is prepared with love the logistics of buying that food is of the highest quality as compared to a restaurant delivering the food or even that caterer God forbid you may throw something at me because you have a caterer in your organization cuz he's cutting corners unless you're very astute to say boss you will cook the food but my purchase manager will Source it and if your purchase manager is eating that food they will buy the best possible rice not the worst possible rice so what I'm trying to communicate we're drinking more energy beverages because we are feeling DEA in the workplace we're feeling DEA because you have not eaten correctly in engineering and MBA or medicine or Finance then we come into the workplace we want to work our asses off to prove to society that we can perform in that process I'm ignoring my nutrition and because I'm ignoring my nutrition I'm getting these Cravings all the time yeah one Fox's sweet over here is very easy Temptation 19 calories right now 19 calories may not seem much but is one Fox's mint gone into your mouth or 16 went into your mouth today there's something called the snacking Gene so what people need to do in 2024 onwards begin to discover which food is thumbs up and which food is thumbs down you start with this you don't need HR you need HR to say that boss you are an amazing employee get moving so I think this is a nice blend wherein today HR needs to be very motivational and that motivation is what's going to get people there and when you talked about scalability you have brand ambassadors is in your own organization who are heroes you bring them on board and the moment that happens so I I'll give you an example in my organization I started breath work for my media team and during the pandemic I gave personal trainers to each and every one of my dieticians out of 50 or 60 only two took it up so I thought maybe my employees don't want it now I did breath work for one team I didn't give it to the entire company the rest of the company is like where's my breath work I also want it right so we all like that when we are not given something we want it so maybe as HR you need to be a little bit what's the word crafty because the end goal is what you want them to come and ask you for that because the moment they ask you for it the compliance is even better interesting part so a lot of companies also end up running these step challenges or you know step counter challenges wherein you know they set targets that whoever you know tracks the most number of steps wins like maybe or they have very interesting Awards and things like that so that you know ends up making people just walk a number of steps or just do this all shake their phon shake their oh yeah I had a guy I had a guy who tied the phone to his dog and got more St done tie the phone to thean very so your question is is it good bad or ugly yeah what are your thoughts about it like step challenges are they the best way to go and how can you make it more holistic because that's only incorporating physical fitness right it's not incorporating other I think it's very easy to criticize any initiative what you need to do is like any business if you start a new Venture you say I want to start this and you want to see where it goes now as a nutritionist when I look at that I tell people walking is the best fat burning exercise we are all DJs you and I are DJs desk jockeys we sit at a desk right so we have no movement for eight or nine hours do you know that the the latest killer is actually sitting down so I think if organizations do step walking it's a great way to encourage people because we are sedentary uh what you do to encourage people to walk could be your kitty of gifts that you could give people one thought process and I'm so I'm basically Pro doing this in an organization it's very easy to do it's very easy to motivate people in fact on 2nd of October I'm launching something called the Gandhi Janti walk 4,000 steps a day and and the idea is because because we are the sickest population of lifestyle diseases what is lifestyle diseases diabetes hypertension uh fatty liver all come because of sedentary too much of eating no movement no calorie burn walking is amazing the issue with walking or Walker THS is the moment the general J stops doing it for 10 or 15 days so there'll be that Elite guys who like yeah they're walking walking walking they gone ahead now you have all of these lagard say let's let's drop off so I think I would invite solutions from people out here how could you make it engaging such that every day people are sticking to that walking so then you'll have people you know taking a sales call or an HR call just walking and talking but trust me Amir Khan when he said how can I lose this much of weight for my roll and dungle I was like you need to walk 38,000 steps a day none of us can walk 38,000 steps that's almost 38 kilomet how can you do it right but he had a role to do it we are asking people do 4 to 6,000 steps a day weight maintainance is 10,000 steps those of you want to lose weight is above 10,000 steps a day so a lot of women especially do exercise for 1 hour like oh but I worked for 1 hour but 1 hour is only 4 to 5,000 steps which is not enough for fat loss or weight loss and and evolution is unfair to women because because it's made women store fat for child birthing so unfortunately when you are in the workplace you don't have enough of movement and so stons are even better for a sizable woman population but then the psychological thing is I don't have time to do it so then you need a psychologist here on this discussion for him like how do we let people understand that they're responsible for their health okay makes sense but uh Wellness isn't something that people aren't doing right like everyone's incorporating Wellness in their own ways these days we see people I mean being wellness company ourselves we promote Wellness too much but nowadays we're seeing people who are going over into this whole thing we see people who know suddenly they start over exercising when they've not been exercising all their lives recently I I recently came across someone who was you know above 65 and then they suddenly thought that they could finish an Iron Man thing and then you know they didn't they had major after that but how do you sort of uh address these situations then there are people who end up you know taking unchecked they end up taking unchecked supplements as well because you know they read content around it or someone or they watch Ryan Fernando and they took took a supplement on the video yeah I mean you know or any other source Ryan Fernando is still very credible Source but you know some someone must have just suggested oh this Omega 3 or something like this does this this this but but is that right for me and yeah just something around these so the first part is everyone believes they're James Bond when they go to a gym right right and obviously even I when I go to the gym I see all of these guys working out and I still think I'm 19 years old of age and I can deadlift more and the first part is I think um for people in corporate India is your if you're a white colored worker get a trainer get get a nutritionist if you're a blue colored worker uh you're invariably not going to afford a trainer or a nutritionist so then there's enough of content on the internet that directs you how to work out uh people need to know this it takes about 2 weeks to 6 weeks to develop cardiovascular acclimatization meaning you can't suddenly start running it will take you 2 to 6 weeks for your heart to say huh by you're ready so you have to go for 2 to 6 weeks it takes your muscles about 3 months 90 days to start feeling that non swess it takes your ligaments and cartilage and Joints about 270 days so a lot of people overdo those pull-ups overdo that walking and then the knee is not yet ready the muscle is ready but the joint may not be ready so anybody starting a fitness program is starting point is you're in beginner program for the first year all you have to do is turn up every day even if you work out for 10 minutes it's a success give one day in a week as a rest just turn up so I'll go to the gym I'll just turn up like today I missed my workout so I'm going to go back home uh I'll do some push-ups I'll just turn up I'll do some breathing I'll do some Nam Sy stem what I'll turn up so people just turn up over a year the body gets ready uh and what HR organizations can do is create more awareness about these shorter workouts uh you get shorter formats of workouts which people can do which are not a strain on the cardiovascular system skeletal system or the muscle system but then I'll tell you why people strain because their number one goal is weight loss um I had the privilege of sitting in a meeting with some of the leading Founders in the country in healthcare businesses and most of their Healthcare diet plans came from weight loss over 68% so if you're looking at Weight Loss what is your common thought fastest way to lose weight that logic has to be tempered with greater awareness greater resources being offered great greater seminars and stuff like that with regards to the self-prescription that's the worst I had a story once where uh this lady came into the clinic um and um she was U diagnosed with liver cancer um young lady 34 35 liver cancer why she was taking ayurvedic fat burner to lose weight now I don't know if I'm I don't know where she bought what from but the English medicine doctor absolutely shot down our ancient tradition system it's not the fault of the ancient traditional system of ayura the fault is a spurious manufacturer creating something which had heavy metals in it and those heavy metals turned up and destroyed her liver and her hemoglobin good news is she survived good news is she doesn't take any nutritional supplements bad news was that she decided to watch stuff or check with her auntie neighbor or check with her office colleague or check with Ryan Fernando on a free advice on YouTube suppl but supplements are a nutritional convenience for your nutritional indiscipline so I tell people get exercise discipline get sleep discipline get diet discipline then take a supplement supplement surgery is like you know what I was just coming now there was a Zen next to me maruti Zen so it's a nice classic now right he's got a Ferrari sticker on it does that make it a Ferrari so that's the exact thing Ferrari sticker for me is by ex protein Po got it so because some sports star is taking protein powder I am going to take protein powder without doing the hard work to become a Ferrari so that zenar represents at that point that yes he has an aspirational value to be Ferrari but when you do that with supplements you causing damage to the internal mechanism in you interesting I'm not saying supplements are bad I prescribe supplements I'm Pro supplement but when you kind of do it's like in your own organization people writing their own paycheck and think they're better than uh HR guys like the other day one one of my HR lady came to me she was very angry says sir why are you giving offer letter I I was like sorry ma'am I am there now fully HR team is there why are you writing offer letter same thing you go to the expert they will craft a beautiful letter which is proper for the employee proper for the company and the founder but I was being like a self prescription I will write HR offer letter so these are the things that we need to not do rely on Experts and I think this comes in India from this jugar thing saving money we all want to save money for what your body is the most expensive real estate spend on it are you uh more of a carrot or a stick guy I'm asking this because you know when you're desig a Intervention Program you end up using either of either one of those approaches either you end up incentivizing a lot or you end up penalizing a lot so what would be your take on this there's there's no easy way to answer this and all of you are HR heads over here would would be there at some point if your organization is fluff and clouds and lovey doy then use the carrot model if your organization is a go-getter organization you normally use the kind of there is a reward but there's also a stick model the greatest NBA basketball coaches are the coaches who kicked their players I'm not saying that HR has to kick people but I'm going with this fact that in Wellness the HR has to offer the carrot model the experts sleep coach psychologist nutritionist trainer has to take the L and beat the employee not figuratively but I've got to tell you you are 15 kgs overweight what the hell are you doing your cholesterol is 50 basis points out in the next 10 years you're going to be taking statins if you take statins flag hoisting is not going to happen at home if you get my drift so I have to do the stick but HR has to do the carrot and I think sometimes we too afraid and and I can understand your perspective I remember in this one incident I was discussing it with the team outside we went to this organization and we're like sir you're missing your 5:00 appointment the guy comes in put you guys control everything in my life my target my sales my everything now you're also controlling my diet like oh who is this guy and he was head of sales and he was like 120 kgs now I can't use the stick model on a guy like this first of all he was double my size so in such a thing what we did and I'll tell you exactly what we did is we apologized and then I wrote him a letter as the expert about so she was like irritated like sir so I like no sir how old is your son or daughter I have a son he's 10 years old so I immediately Cal said sir sales call whenever you want to reach out this is our number here we here so I wrote him a nice letter the next day saying that I looked at his blood test and I found out that his blood markers were not good and I would like to be present for his son's wedding along with him but I predict that he might I predict that his son might have to be in the hospital with him because he could have a higher risk of heart attack BP or cancer next week Friday 5:00 he was there in the room dror sa sorry I'm not a doctor I'm nutrition n dror sa one side was the stick which was the expert but the HR say did everything possible to make him understand that look you know what if you don't want this thing we we'll take it away you'll give we'll give you an all all expense paid vacation instead of a diet plan with a nutritionist so there is no right and wrong rule the the problem we are having today is the scalability problem the scalability problem is the biggest problem because every employee expects personalization and if technology can give you personalization I think we'll win the battle with carrot rather than stick that's a very good thought to you know Le on considering we the on who like okay personaliz programs like that but uh so recently you know there's been a lot of talk about stress at workpl but you know uh now with companies taking up actions against or preventive actions to avoid it there could be you know thoughts of you know employees thinking that okay company is doing it for their benefit they're not actually concerned about me reducing my stress they're just concerned that you know okay I don't do something on of stress so they look bad how would you sort of you know address this topic of uh stress at workplace and you know from your background how would you provide Solutions around it uh myour Highway they collected 9 Crowes of fine uh with automatic AI cameras right people over speeding or not wearing seat belts the question is boss tax or you don't allow me to drive my car fast you don't allow me to you I should decide no what seat Bel I want to wear but there is an overall consensus on what we call as societal Norm for protection of society so we know that debts happen because I'm not wearing seat belt but people want to fight back so yes it is an employees god-given right to feel that keep by my employers against me and really looking out for me I have been an employee and 12 years ago I became an employer so I've been on both sides of the coin yes as an entrepreneur I have limited amount of money to take care of the employees sometimes and as an EMP employee I was demanding that I want a gym membership I want all of this and my boss at that time didn't give it to me part one you are responsible for your destiny as an individual first getting up at 5:00 in the morning and doing meditation your company is not going to do it for you packing a healthy tiffen box your company is not going to do it for you doing box breathing four breaths in four breaths hold four breaths out four breaths release is something you can do after every meeting or telephone call which lowers your BP heart rate and connects your parasympathetic nervous system this information is there compliance doesn't happen but when an organization asks you to do it boss bad cop HR is only for picnic and bad cop I've seen it my HR is like chewed up I'm like boss these guys are trying to take care of you no don't that's human nature you got to figure it out how it's going to going to work so I think at an organizational level the anxiety and mental anguish and this is controversial doesn't start in the workplace starts in your diet I will show you enough of research I will show you enough of people and mark my words I will sit in an audience like this 10 years later we will pull up this video where research will be saying this employee is having having mental issues please go and get a poop stool analysis I keep coming back to poop the gut microbiome you have more bacteria in your gut than your human cells and the gut eat the food first and dump the molecule back into you called the micro uh uh what micro ballone or something it's called b b b basically it's the the bacteria pooping back in you now that absorbs into your bloodstream and if it's a good bacteria you're feeling good if it's a bad bacteria you're bashing your boss's face in right so anxiety is starting because of nutritional incompetence nutritional unawareness I'll give you an example all of you in this room show me your blood test have you done a magnesium have you done a hemoglobin have you done a fertin have you done an iron have you done a magnesium blood test if any one of these are low you will always begin to feel anxious or have cravings you change that and suddenly you feel like a 100 m athlete so this is the first part your brain is made up of 60% fat 50% of this fat is made up of omega3 what are we using in our workplace our brains and when your brain doesn't have the right oils in the diet which is omega-3 all you have to do is add Shia seeds flax seeds and if you're a non-vegetarian uh mackerel salmon and chovies I can do a 15 to 18 hour non-stop lecture ask my team I'm at it the brain is good because it's got the right raw material so if you're putting that for an anxiety I'm telling you most of your problem so my wife things I'm very insensitive breaking news so and so so and so anxiety and blah blah blah committed suicide and I'm like is B12 defic my wife's like you're so insensitive I'm like no I'm not it's B complex deficiency it's nutritional deficiency India is not eating correctly forget the workplace start eating correctly so if you can get your people to just do that blood test in the vitamin and mineral department and if you can organization can afford a screening of the poop the employees going to be like you want to check my now it's like this is going to be the future massive invasion of privacy massive invasion of privacy uh we talking about omega3 this is more a personal question Ali bed omega3 or fish bed Omega uh so good question so fish based omega-3 have two guys in it EPA and dhf so if you can you can think of two two managers uh EPA is like the C CFO and uh DHA is like the COO okay now in alga Omega you get more of the DHA guy the COO guy you you don't get the other guy so if your genetics are good to produce the necessary Omega-3s alga omega-3 is good enough the The Dilemma for me comes when somebody says I'm a staunch vegetarian then I'm like at least take an algal omega-3 but if you say to me that you know um it's okay I can take a fish oil supplement and I'm like okay you're taking EP and DHA of minimum 500 migr per capsule or better still eat this fish or better still have fish-based omega-3 the vegetarian a flax seeds vegan algae Omega but I would recommend every V vegetarian on the planet I have no commercial affiliation to any company the the vegetarian vegan Al Omega which comes from the ocean is a supplement that I would prescribe to the entire Workforce in India unless you have a CV delery okay I think let's uh close this and open this up for the audience what's one one thing that you would suggest to everyone in the audience who's primarily you know uh designing a wellness program was one thing that they could start doing from Tomorrow onwards everybody is doing blood tests in your organizations get a company to come in and say with will you talk to my employees about five things with that blood test that they can do to improve the blood test the next year and give them a carrot that this year your cholesterol was 240 without medication in the next 6 months if it goes down you get kabani Park trip or something like that because you got to motivate people and you need to do it only once the moment the fitness bug bites that person you will see this in your own organization there'll be that one silent person that motivates every by a by let's go for a walk then two people start joining then four people start joining you need to have that Collective enthusiasm being built start with the blood test I believe that is the starting point in India because that is the report card of your employee that's it all right I think we can open this up for questions now if someone I think yes that person ra the first SE walking every day but she no so when you had that we need to walk so what type of walking will what of walk would you suggest very good question because you've taken out the most important thing of the equation which is everyone wants to walk to lose weight so if you take that out and you're walking for help then even if you do 4 to 6,000 steps a day number one now an average person of Indian height both male and female 4 to 6,000 steps will take you 1 hour so the question is to ask do I have 1 hour in the day and that 4 to 6,000 steps actually confers upon you cardiovascular benefits movement of your gut so you have a better bowel movement the next day um uh joints when you walk you don't need to power walk or walk super fast where you're slamming ing your legs on the foot path by going faster because you're putting a load on your knees always tell people if you're walking for health walk gingerly walk Happy Walk listening to your best songs in the morning or in the evening walk on walk on soft cushion floor which is grass or mud uh but we live in city so we have a lot of concrete the worst walking you can do is on the power treadmills I'd rather you cycle on a cycle and watch your favorite program in the evening versus walking on a treadmill in your house treine look as a nutritionist when people say brisk walking I my next question is yes please brisk walk but how much so the next question is I have only so much of time so then I will say okay you got 45 minutes you can if you can brisk walk and your heart can take it so when people can afford exercise variables which is another thing that I would encourage organization some people it gives anxiety some people the exercise variables is a great thing total number of steps duration of time to to finish those steps basically what you do is brisk walk is a very qualitative term how fast did you walk what distance in a time is a quantitative measure for every person all I want that person over 365 days is to show an incremental benefit of walking how number of steps over the years so first month so first month they had 1 lakh Target then next month one 1 lakh 10,000 and by the end of the year they've hit let's say 4 lakhs per month steps but they do it in 45 minutes or 35 minutes so that means a walk is becoming more brisker and the final metrics is at the beginning of the year when I walked at this distance and time my resting heart rate went up to 155 160 by the end of the year my resting heart rate is only 130 when I do the same distance that is called cardiovascular trained Fitness so the idea is always look at the quantitative measure how does your body feel and one advice I will give people you suddenly start walking without stretching you are going to injure your joints you have to slow stretch walk slowly stretch your cares hamstring and you know what if you're earning enough of money hire a trainer for the first month just to teach you how to walk or download the videos which teach you about warm up before you start walking then walk for 30 to 90 days Aram say after 90 days start brisk walking next question so hi my name is I hope foro first of all love the session the way it is conducted and and I could correlate with the way you are giving example right so I also give one small one earlier I was working for IND Airlines I was reading the South Region so I had my manager so she was a fitness freak right so looking at her veget what what lunch box she used to buy not by what she used to get right we used to measure her you know Wellness level right she's getting the car or any vegetable we know it's a good mode but if it's to be a papaya or something else we know that that day we not going to go not talk to them that was Li note but yeah that that really happened and trust me you know the toughest discussions we had when she had got a good food that's one thing now coming back to my question my question was that I'm leading a business which has an average age of 28 to 48 right so does age matter when we do anything it's a one size all something we can do right very good question um very good question I mean I I would ask myself this question as founder of my quand clinics I have about 180 employees today and um we we grew over the last 2 three years and um initially I thought that I want older dietitians older employees but I'm also finding that younger employees come with with This brilliant spark in them or U uncluttered ideas ideas that are not U you know coming with baggage with them so now let me answer this question as a non- business person but as a nutritionist I am 48 years of age my metabolic age is 34 I can conduct a meeting for 15 hours and the 34 yearold in my team is fallen asleep my point being sir is this the psychometrics by which you recruit somebody should never be defined by a number I have seven employees in my company are over 60 years of age and they bring a flavor of responsibility turning up at 8:00 in the uh 8:00 in the morning the company and they look at the youngsters and like there are problem we are old people we can't even get out bed and we are here in the office before you and the youngsters are like by we don't watch Netflix like you buggers so the point is you need to figure out the people you recruiting for that team and only the team leader the business owner and the HR people can figure out the best mix don't discount somebody for their age their weight their gender or even their cultural disposition in our country you know so there's a lot of racism within our country in our workspace I don't think we should Define age I would do this I would do that blood test and if you see bad parameters and and I've actually done this in organization I've told a person your parameters are very bad you're a smoker I'm recruiting you as a consultant for 6 months give up smoking improve these parameters I'll confirm you as an employee so now that person's motivated to kind of do that so then I go back to my hrn is the person doing it no they're not doing it then that person will not bring that go getting energy to my team because if you can't change your life where the hell are you going to change the variables of doing something in that business which will contribute to the growth of my team which will contribute to the growth of my company next question yes sir hi Kik yes so it's a good question okay um there are two types of people on the planet salt responders and salt non-responders so you can get BP even without a higher sodium so the first thing that I would do is when a person comes to me with the cases I would look whether the the BP is driven by salt or not and there's a genetic test to do that because if it's not driven by salt then I tell the person you can eat any salt but too much of salt causes water retention which affects your kidney which is causes your blood pressure to go up so bottom line is namako then we come to which namok now people like to create marketing out of everything because there a demand and Supply in today's world pink salt and Celtic salt are salts that have a lower sodium content but this is General marketing say please understand manufactured salt is the perfect salt because it has the right amount of sodium constructed in it whereas rock salt or Celtic salt or any other salt that is there which is derived from nature when that salt is produced from that pool we do not know the mineral content at that time and age when that salt was made therefore the variability factor in that salt is my conclusion saying that boss I'd rather go with a known devil which is XYZ brand low sodium salt when you want to use this pink salt and Celtic salt I would say you use it on top of your salads or in your sparkling water water when you want to be a little bit better bottom line is people get BP today because from a very young age uh if you come to my house Mr Karthik you will not find a salt shaker in my house my parents recently came my mom's like where's the salt shaker I'm like there's no salt shaker what sort of person are you you don't have any table maners there should be salt and pepper I'm like Mom there's no salt and pepper shaker because my son at 11 will start putting salt in food then he becomes years old he goes to the fortune Fire Company he puts salt in his food when he's 30 he puts salt in his food he tells his wife not enough salt is than food what your mother didn't teach you how to cook properly he puts more salt in the food he reaches 40 there's so much of salt in his body he got BP so the starting point is removing the salt shaker for the next generation of children in your family thank you I think I have one question we were talking about earlier so this is more like a r fire thing intermittent fasting or 100% if you are overweight if you've got a punch your waist size your dress doesn't fit you your SAR doesn't fit you you're a guy where your belly sticking over your um you know what I'm trying to say right yes to intermittent fasting the human race is eating too much intermittent fasting is not going to destroy you how to do it is the secret I would suggest to coroporate India to delay your breakfast come early and eat a lunch at 12: and try and eat your dinner as early as possible so you shorten the eating window uh but for those of you who don't want to do eating uh intermittent fasting the simplest rule is keep start fasting in chapati and is that the reason why we tend to be more skinny fat with respect to our body I I think as I said we're des chalkies and we're still eating like how Mama and Papa have eaten but Mama and Papa have walked 5 8 kilomet a day I don't have my exercise able today but I'm assuming today I would have walked no more than 1 kilom right I just came I was dropped right over here few steps here and there so we are not moving so because we not moving this is a big problem so intermittent fasting works it has magnificent benefits only if you have a medical problem consult a medical dietician when you're doing intermittent fasting our ancestors did fasting shivaratri navaratri uh Raman uh lent season we had fasting written our spiritual books unfortunately the new generation that we are we have become lazy religious spiritual people so we don't subscribe to what our dadas and parents do more aggressively in spirituality which has fasting written in it very very insightful session I think we'll have to end it right here I think we're overflowing into Ro now so thank you so much for coming in I think
