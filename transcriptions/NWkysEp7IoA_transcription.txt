well my kid he's a nutritionist son perfect diet perfect dental hygiene would you believe it he had 11 cavities now when I wrote the book wheatless in Israel there's a pediatric study done among 90 children and they found out that children that were DNA sensitive to gluten or who had celiac disease had a higher incidence of PLA and Cavities almost 90% more so I did not know this and my kid was happily eating pastries cakes biscuits you know uh bread and all of the stuff that contained gluten and when I did his DNA test and then I found out that I had to remove these foods and we strategically removed them lo and behold those Le cavities were treated by the dentist but no more cavities after that so sometimes food could be the culprit it's not the dental hygiene
