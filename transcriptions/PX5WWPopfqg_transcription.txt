Title: how much alcohol can your body tolerate before giving it back? are you a beginner or a pro?

Description: What level of alcohol can you tolerate? Excessive alcohol consumption can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. One of the immediate impacts is impaired judgment and coordination, leading to an increased risk of accidents and injuries. Chronic alcohol abuse can take a toll on the liver, causing conditions such as fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. It also weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections. Over time, alcohol can contribute to cardiovascular issues, including high blood pressure and an increased risk of heart disease. Mental health is not spared, as alcohol abuse is linked to depression, anxiety disorders, and an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorders. Long-term alcohol misuse is associated with cognitive deficits and an elevated risk of dementia. Additionally, excessive drinking can strain relationships, impair work performance, and lead to social isolation. Responsible and moderate alcohol consumption is key to avoiding these adverse effects and maintaining overall health and well-being.
