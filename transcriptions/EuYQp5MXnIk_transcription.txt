Sophia Rodriguez Secretary of Ima bardes to kindly escort Mr Ryan Fernando onto the Days please I will request Dr Sophia to kindly welcome sir with a flow as well welcome thank you thank you so much thank you Mr Ryan thank you Dr Sophia I will now hand over the proceedings to uh Dr Priyanka for her initiation she can initiate the topic thank you good morning to all whenever I try to avoid that namkin at my friend's place during an evening at when I go go to her place I often said so as we see that unfortunately poor eating has become a norm and healthy eating is called dieting and we have already seen the result in the previous talk what has happened and where have we reached it's such an alarming situation about non-communicable diseases we need to remember that we are a country wherein food is called The Almighty himself paa Brahma and eating the act of eating is called yya karma the act of offering to the body and soul so we genuinely it's time that we make those trillions of bacteria in our gut let's put them to some good work not only to make this yya K Karma successful but also walk the talk that we do in our clinics and Enlighten our patients and help them stay away from the non-communicable diseases which are an epidemic today so I hand over the mic to Dr Ry for this talk to help us Enlighten on this topic thank you Doctor hi good afternoon everyone the first doctor lucky gave you a perception of how powerful your mind can be and you have to climb to Mount Everest let me tell you I'm going to be watching all your plates this afternoon at lunch and I'm going to be taking photographs on your plate to Mount Everest and then Dr Gita has actually made my session a little shorter because she said diet she kept saying diet and I would like to thank all the doctors over here for inviting me chiefly my classmate Dr vardan we played Cricket together in 11th standard I studied at Goa Medical College my clinical B yeah he hit a six off me so when when he called up my wife picked up the call the call at our clinic so I have about six clinics 75 dietitians is called Quan nutrition clinics so she says there's this Von Doctor Who's called you from from um from the Goa I like and the first thought was nice hook shot hit me for a six that's my memory of him but I also have a memory of a very senior doctor that you may know and she in my opinion has made me a very rich nutritionist today Dr Shanti pomani so she was a head of H biochemistry I was the only boy among five of us in the Masters in clinical biochemistry I think the course is no longer conducted at Goa Medical College I think we were the second last batch and because of was the only boy she would keep me back send all the girls home and I would I would not I was like why me and U 30 years later I know why so I want to take a little bit of time to share with you two parts you the doctor the human being and you the doctor the creator of behavior in your patients I make a lot of money as a nutritionist because the doctors have not focused on diet as yet and I request you to begin to focus on that because you can charge an extra 3,000 rupees for a diet plan and that many places we have gone we've gone to Dubai and a business failed in Dubai and I'll say this publicly in a for him the doctor didn't like us charging more than what they were charging so there is a lot of potential to changing Behavior now why do people not listen because food is like Mount Everest Indians are Health loving no Health doing but the pandemic has changed this for all of us yeah I worked with a lot of celebrities Farin Khan's transformation has been the latest I don't know if you've seen Farin Khan go from 103 to to uh the weight he has at why do these people do it why do the sports Stars win it and why can't we common people not do it it's because anyone can do it because at the top of their Mount Everest they already have a paycheck of a few Crowes if somebody told you in this audience I would give you 1 CR rupees on December 2024 each one of you in this room as Dr Gita said lose 10 kgs and liver improves everything is in the diet as a clinical biochemist I can tell you we have reversed conditions so I'll start today's lecture for each one of you I don't want I don't want to know about the next patient that you receive but you as a doctor are extremely valuable if I was prime minister of India and you were all the generals in the Army the investment in you is very expensive the knowledge that you have is very expensive so I always ask people what vehicle do you drive right and I've seen doctors love to buy vehicles on the Comfort Dr dubashi is my upstairs neighbor his mother used to always tell us abas I didn't study much I became a nutritionist so I have huge reverence to doctors so he's telling me how he change different cars he says problem as I don't keep the car I sell it amazing philosophy amazing philosophy now ask you this question you would have changed what five six cars in your lifetime already can you change the human body you can't change the human body and therefore if you don't remember anything from today's lecture please leave this lecture with one thought your body is the most expensive real estate you will ever own you can change your house you can change your mobile you can change your laptop you can change your spouse you can change your spouse also you can't change your kid you can't change your parents and you can't change the human body this is my perspective to you take care of yourself first before you take care of your colleagues your hospital your patients how do we do this and look I know you all studied I studied first year mbbs with you all in the same thing nutrition was six lectures and I remember two three doctors coochie coing in the background and stuff like that but the perspective here is nutrition is becoming massively s ific and the second takeaway for you today is the bio individuality I Nam my clinic Quan nutrition Quan Latin means incapacity it means when I drink orange juice and if you drink orange juice with a CGM device because of my microbiome there is a different sugar Spike there is a g difference glycemic response which means the orange has a said glycemic index but my genetics my genetics and my microbiome bring about that biod bio-individuality so I challenge scientific studies because the population subset is for a group of people that may not agree with Shah ruk Khan Amir Khan Ryan Fernando Dr vardan or Dr Vishal or any of you doctors out here you're bio individual and hence a little bit more time to understanding your patients your patient or you for example fat cells reside in your body for 8 years 8 years RBC is for 4 months so when you try to change behavior in patients what Behavior exercise behavior and diet Behavior unfortunately a Prescription Pad will not work if it worked you'd be prescribing diet left right and center now why doesn't it work what's the logical thought next it's because 99.99% of the planet doesn't climb up to Mount Everest and the biggest Tempest on the planet is your taste buds the biggest Tempest on the planet is your taste buds and finally all of us eat out of love and culture I came home I refuse to eat at home to nutritionist you can't eat bread all your life you are a Pala you ate bread at breakfast lunch dinner I've written a book called weakless because I did my DNA test my nutrigenomics has told me I'm gluten intolerant and lactose intolerant at the age of 34 I found out this after years of producing claricy in my body producing applying it and producing it nothing happened my adult acne you can still see it on my face scarred what was the thought process are Baba bread doesn't agree with you no but you're born in Goa no hello but my father's tamilan and then when I did the ancestry Gene get this I have 9% Rajasthani Gene I have 177% Telugu Gene God knows which grandfather banged which grandmother [Music] where so this thing that I am culturally firm Goa was I may have learned here for the last decad so Dr Gita made this point you eat local I would enhance that point a little further nutriomics the science of genes is clearly coming out data the only problem that you can shoot me on is it's a lot of Caucasian based data I am awaiting the genetic research over the next decade that comes out of this population subset and that's where you will begin to start telling your patients what not what to eat just how much to eat and timing you have three components doctors just work on portion control and work on timing because what to eat orange juice works for him orange juice doesn't work for me that's going to be where you do the diagnostic so why I talked about this is I I see doctors eating and I do a lot of lectures in hospitals where I go spend two three days in different hospitals around the world they invite me and I interact with the different departments and all the uh the cafeteria is a place where you can observe uh doctor behaviors towards diet and there are some doctors today and you will laugh but you'll remember there one or two doctors they carry their own tiffen box to the hospital bio individual bio individual I'm glad you're carrying your tiffen box so when you are carrying your own tiffen box you are treating your body as a landlord you are landlord in your own body you are not a tenant so this is very very important okay uh and I've done thousands Quan nutrition has been around since 2010 the pandemic has changed our fortunes because people understood hey I've got two cars two houses two bunglow two Mistresses all of that stuff but I can't use any of this wealth if my health is not good this is Mr Vishnu Pai with with approval from him he was a 72y old 10.3 glycemic hb1c okay insulin amputated toe came to me for a nutrition plan his son was doing workout and everything with me and said he told his father why don't you go the older people are very resistant after 40 your mind gets into this concrete mindset you know everything okay some doctors are laughing we just worked on body composition walking and changed his diet genetically he lost 11 years in his body age I'll give you the weighing scale that I feel every doctor in this room should have in their Clinic not a weighing scale a body composition scale because you can frighten the crap out of your patients I I I I wish I had brought it here today I would have made half of you stand on it and you would realize your birth certificate age is a wrong age of yours you will be a good decade and a half older than your birth certificate so we dropped 11 years in his body age son came back to me very happy Mr Fernando this is dryfruit gift hamper thank you very much and he gave give me some gift vouchers for his brand and everything so like sir I you paid me and all no no no sir my father earns 2 cres a year is a consultant 72 he is now thinking he 61 years of age sir 11 years into two CR sir 22 cres of wealth so your body is the most expensive real estate if you are 50 60 70 years of age and you're a decade younger because of your exercise and your diet now your body truly is the most valuable real estate so I want you to spend more time tracking use trackers for your walk use trackers for your resting heart rate photograph your own food for 10 days you will become your own personal dietician and you will change now okay you have different uh streams and revenues I have medical dietitians for each stream and revenue you can get in touch with me I'll give you my number at the end of presentation but Dr Gita made very valuable points on diet weight loss exercise so I'm not going to bore you guys because you know about this but what I'd like to share with you is my own personal experience on magnesium I play a lot of um I do a lot of physical activity every day one one and a half hour every day T the miniscus at age of 48 done all of that my wife keeps telling what's wrong with you but it's a point to try and prove that the human body can still become younger and then there was this study in America which I read one half of the uh group was 72 years old so imagine all of you are 72 imagine all of you are 72 this side this group was in an old age home they put Bingo Ludo je all of those games and all in the basement for the old age people to play this group they put a gym in the basement this group started complaining we 72 we retired what they want us to work out and all they did a biopsy on the quadricep muscle 6 months later they found that the muscle regressed in age by 6 years so if there's one thing that I would give you as a gift today especially the women doctors hire a personal trainer and wait train don't run wait train walk yoga you need strength as you get older and muscle is the only age reversible organ this if you can start doing or leading your community as a doctor in we training people will start following you it's a change of momentum that we need in society which now our current generation as doctors you're beginning to realize so just Advocate that a little bit further it's it's lovely that we can do different things a lot of My Success is because of the ability to link blood test by the way the entire presentation is available at free download I will give you a QR code at the end just scan it it will take you straight to the presentation you can download it to your phone so you'll get the whole presentation if you wish so I worked with many film stars I'll give you quick quick tips very very quickly okay glutathione you all know glutathion liver glutathion peroxide super it is basically the aishwara r system in your body I also want to be missor right glutathione is found in this plant that will grow in most of our Gardens in Goa percan take this and I'll teach you a simple tricker there's something called Google Lens doctors have you heard of Google Lens when you go to Google search on the side there'll be one camera click that camera point it at a herb Google will tell you what's the herb then you research the herb you'll find out it grows in your garden I grow this on my Terrace in Bangalore and I have it once or twice a week doctor what about uh uh glutathione as a nutritional supplement in coid time you would have read the research papers High dosing of glutathione helped right but glutathione absorption by your gut hey your gut is super good my gut is not so good so you might absorb 300 milligrams I might absorb only 2 milligrams so the next stage is what I feel is the new designer business for doctors infusion inions nutritional infusions and that is what all the film stars and Jeff Bezos and all are doing globally so I'm just thinking what medications you prescribe to clients today came in the ' 70s 80s and '90s and now the advancements are then that's becoming mainstream I believe nutritional infusions could be something so doctors try it out glutathion is an infusion you get younger spirulina it is been hidden by the farmer industry but if spirina agrees with your gut 500 to 4 G 5 G A Day smells like Nala water so I take capsules okay it's blue green algae works really really well by the way I use this on all of my clients okay uh and what I've done is I've given you the scientific studies for each one of them so like how kumin now all of you know about kumin you know about HDI I remember in Co I designed before the vaccination came out I designed one because I just read a paper which says that uh curcumin at a certain level in a Petri dish broke the prongs of the cold virus in replication so virus is a virus I think we suffered lesser because most of our food had hthy in it right so food for thought if food can be medicine Why not start adding that as part of your prescription Prat could your patient have a coconut water with qu teaspoon of termeric in it the patients you will understand and You' have been experiencing this like Dr Gita said no the patients ask me tell me doctor I'll write down right now what I need to eat three four tips on Good Foods as selectors you can't change the diet of a person you need a dietitian you need a nutritionist they need to keep going to that person back again to change yearlong Behavior even if I have to change any doctor's Behavior many doctors come to me for diet plan I'm like dude you have to work with me for six months if I give you a blueprint it's not that you can't follow the blueprint it's a segment of habit which is why diet will be the most difficult thing to change because of people's taste buds asanin huge amount of research in anti-aging huge amount of research in cancer uh it's available as a nutritional supplement 4 milligrams I can actually write down a whole thing that you can do as a doctor do it for one year take photographs of your skin take photographs of your body composition and we can actually do our age reversal of your own self very very possible collagen is number one especially for the women six weeks of collagen now people will say type one type two type 3 collagen listen we don't absorb collagen we absorb the amino acids the pool of amino acids in in collagen and the pool of amino acids in whe protein or the pool of amino acids in mutton is different what what is happening is people are not dietary disciplined to eat the quantity that they require till today medicine is a very scientific topic you have a disease you have a diagnosis you have a medication you have a therapeutic dozing and you know the period of time for to get the outcome of that result diet is not like that because of the genetics because of the behavioral impact of a client being disciplined to the dozing of food as a medicine but for me collagen amazing on skin and I'm saying this to all the women in the organization fine line wrinkles fine line wrinkles reduced by up to 67% in 6 weeks on dozing with collagen bone broth soup somebody mentioned Portuguese culture earlier when we were there bone Brad soup is huge in uh European culture in the mediterian diet use that for your soft tissue joints ligaments skin all of that amla there was a research paper triglycerides uh LDL and um vdl was reduced by 15 basis points on two amas every morning in a group of about 700 I've I've linked this study over here I've actually put the study over here uh and so on uh heart markers amla really works I hate amla so what I do organic amla powder I buy organic amla powder I toss it every morning first thing into my mouth and then wash it down with water that's there so that's my Statin reducer to keep my cholesterol low I'm not saying that somebody has high cholesterol can do it but could you do medical prescription and purposely give a diet prescription cuz I'll tell you what patients do when they come to us and I want to stop my medication I'm like you can't do that go back to your doctor they hate me for sending me back to the doctor to reduce the dosage because we're doing before and after no no I don't want to go back to the doctor he'll not not a reducer dose I said but he's the boss he will tell you whether it's safe to stop taking the medication or not so if you start adding a few Foods over there almonds boost uh HDL baked beans all all our legumes and beans change the microbiome mark my words you will start reading research papers that come out which will be changing all of this okay there's selenium Brazil nut very good okay fasting is amazing fasting is amazing the latest the research that is coming out 30 hours is The Sweet Spot of fasting which cleans up mitochondria which are old biosynthesis LDL U lipoprotein A lipoprotein B levels All Fall Down I would love for you to report back to me if any of you are able to do a 30-hour fast very simple you finish eating today at 5:00 in the evening then distract yourself till you go to sleep with everything except food don't surround yourself with your friends because they say come let's go eat cutl bread at dvas and Miramar is that guy still over there huh so this side yes so these are the guys who who are exercising eating cutl bread and exercising but uh there will be proponents of fasting please try it on yourself and please report back to me on the body scale of fat percentage just 3 months of fasting once or twice a week does it improve your lipid profile and does it drop your body fat percentage the reason it does but I tell people practice it because a lot of people say no I don't think it works um the problem for all vegetarian people is collagen is bone broth I forgot this so there's a way to make veg collagen by putting these fruits together by the way the presentation is available to all of you these are the normal things healthy milk cal cal is very famous in this part of the world K fermented rice kji I love cokum water for for this now the thing is it's very very nice to give these Snippets but where do we practice it in our real life I have observed people I I I go to restaurants I observe people you will put all the food on your plate that is not linked to phyton nutrition which is the vegetables or the fruits and that's what Dr Gita said in the first session simple doctors reduce your carbohydrate so you're putting rice in your plate put a teaspoon lesser today makes sidat Goa Sweat by finishing off all the vegetables they'll be like are yeah this is the first conference the chicken didn't go and the mutton didn't go and the fish didn't go but the vegetables went okay this is my secret in my clinic I do the Omega test uh it's an Omega blood test to check the levels of Omega 6 to omega3 to then determine the change of oils in the diet in mothers we do testing of DHA in the breast milk I do the microbiome testing poop analysis you know rheumatoid arthritis is latest is linked to uh a causitive factor in the microbiome so we have slowly experimenting in our clinic in changing the diet factor and we're seeing ra Factor actually dropping so it will be wonderful for those of you who have your own hospitals or clinic hire two three dietician tell them your only job is to keep talking to the patient and this is the diet I want and put your patients on 90 days of therapeutic diet day 1 day 45 day 90 you will see fantastic results coming downwards so suddenly you develop a protocol that's to your name start disseminating that to patients out then the patient will be like this is worked what next then go into diagnostic testing with patients do you want to do your genetic testing do you want to do your microbiome testing right now they expensive the microbiome is about 20 grand and the genetic test for the nutrition one is about 15 grand or so so it is still not in the reach of the Common Man but I expect with Reliance investing in genetic companies and microbiome companies we will get it at 2 to 5,000 rupees by 20 2025 this is the weighing skill I want you to buy I have no commercial Allegiance but I have been using it for a decade it's the Omron karada hbf uh hbf 965 so again I'm sending this presentation to you now why you should have this Wing scale it gives you fat percentage and muscle percentage visceral fat which doctor talked about in the previous B all the fat um sits on top of the organs the heart the liver the kidney everything so what happens is it's a non-invasive diagnostic tool so all these patients that come into your clinic you look at them you already know they are fat you know they have a problem because they are fat you know they have a problem because they can't close their mouth so one day somebody came people do not are not there are three genes overeating Gene snacking Gene and emotional eating I do that in my clinic and then people confess yeah you know what when I'm very stressed out I'm an emotional eater I have got the snacking Gene 9:00 in the evening I am there uh my wife's like what are you doing looking in the fridge and talking into the fridge nobody in the kitchen nobody in the house I'm talking to the fridge I don't know how many of you do this but it's a snacking Gene it's Evolution that made me to move from continent to continent and keep snacking I think okay this is a this is a gold mine of a of a book it is 600 Pages personally compiled by me and my team of 89 foods with their scientific study on how these foods are actually drugs and the dozing in them I can't present this it's too long but that's the QR code it's a flip book on a public domain website I believe in Sharing knowledge my team put it together so simple things like I learned that pomegranate contains beta sta stero which in a onee study where the participants had a full glass of pomegranate juice with the seeds now diabetic remove the juice and take out only the seeds blend the seeds and eat the seeds the cared intermedia thickness went down by 36% so for me reversal is at that level so please find the time if you can to get this and I think this is yeah this is the scan for the entire presentation so if you take the QR code of this scan I'll get out of the way or you just take the mobile number and you will get a wonderful lady at a clinic by the name of DVA just say I played Cricket with Ryan and I hit him for a six I will call you back I'll keep I'll keep it up over here and that's me and my presentation so if I can just summarize I can do 25 hours with you on nutrition and convince you that Nutrition Works on yourself and your patients the simplest thing is you start working on yourself first uh the the magical thing is to walk not run get the wing scale to check your visceral fat and your body age and you can reduce your body age by at least a decade in one year of hardcore eating eating properly exercising properly third is begin to start writing descriptions of portion control to your client and timing to your client try and add fasting in there so if they religious ask them which day of the week do you believe Vishnu Shiva Brahma or if you're a Muslim you know Raman through the day or if you're Christian like us my grandmother fasted on Fridays but we don't do it anymore why Friday Good Friday now we like I am like lazy so I have to scientifically convince myself to fast so write a prescription where for from a religious point of view like you know which is your holy day and do that 24 hours what to eat just say green tea water and maximum if your patients are on anti acids and all of that stuff cucumber final Point look at nutritional supplements from a deficiency point of view asking for vitamins and minerals I think the key cause for lifestyle diseases is the what is do what is the word that doctor used one was malnutrition and the other one was was um over nutrition right so the over nutrition but there's still malnutrition for vitamins and minerals so I'll hand over to my colleague Dr Sachin and if you have any questions I'm going to be here the whole day and I will be watching your plate thank you Ryan for a wonderful presentation uh uh I'll just say three points a visibly unfit doctor prescribing Fitness or health to a patient is an oxymoron nobody's going to take you seriously second a lot of data is available which is written by non doctor so we need to get out of our you know that we live in a very small world where we think that doctors know it all that's not a fact we need to get that information not available in any medical textbook but there's a lot of alternate literature you got to figure it out you got to read it out and make those changes third thing which I would request everybody is start looking at food labels teach your children to read food labels that's a way [Music]
