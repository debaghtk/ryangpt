Transcript: hey guys if you're not able to watch my long form content of podcast here are some short form clips for you to enjoy now I've been working with a lot with longevity and fasting and small portion sizes because I was so impressed with your muscular frame and skeletal frame as a 60 plus doctor what's your take on the muscular part and Longevity or muscles and Longevity yeah so uh longevity is related to lean body mass which is is basically our muscle mass and uh there are studies which say that after the age of 60 and even more so after 70 we lose about 800 to 900 gram of muscle mass every year and that affects our quality of life in Walking In climbing stairs in running and if you take at least 60 gram of protein a day it stops this muscle mass loss and improves quality of life so that is one thing if you want your older period in life and now in Indians even younger period because muscle mass is very poor it will improve quality of life and it is directly related to longevity awesome so you're telling the youngsters muscle train you're telling the old people muscle train you're losing muscle add 60 grams of protein in the day doctor your five favorite muscle exercises so like I said my warm-up is always pushups two sets of yeah two sets of 12 push-ups and two sets of quarts even now with my replac knees I do that and uh then I go on to uh at least uh one body part three exercises so I try either Chas so if I'm in a hurry I will do my big muscles which are the big muscles so big muscles is back big muscles is chest big muscles thighs so I'll say okay I'll do my thighs and go because today I have less time I'll do this or I'll do my back or I'll do my chest the smaller muscles if you have time you can do that but in a hurry uh do your big muscle uh it metabolizes more calories it increase your BMR more what is your shortest workout you have ever done because you were a nari today tell today no I had to go I had to go uh um help a colleague's mother I had to do a dressing before I came here okay so I told my trainer that look I went in I I did my warm-up I did 10 minutes of cardio I did push-ups I did squats and I said today that is enough see there are three exercises which you can do and exercise your whole body push-ups squats and pull-ups if you can do these three exercises all your body muscles are exercised so quickest is two two sets of each after your warm up and then my trainer did 5 minutes of stretching for me stretching is important you cannot get in exercise get out you know one cardiolog this friend of mine did uh he found out that his cholesterol is higher his weight is increasing but a treadmill he would jump onto the treadmill 30 minutes and then run off he developed such severe fibromyalgia in his back his entire back was stiff it took us six months to get him all right I said you can't mess with exercise so what you're saying is people who suddenly decide to oh I'm going to get fit I'm going to start running suddenly stretch first warm up properly start slow and steady because I think a lot of people are getting motivated by these Instagram videos your podcast my podcast and they suddenly think they're James Bond so I say your mind is stronger than your body you think you can do it but you actually cannot so so what are the tips listen to your body should I check my heart rate like for example a lot of people say no no I don't have time but I'm going to run so I'm going to run for 10 minutes but I don't have time to do 10 minutes of stretch up so when somebody's fat somebody's Plum somebody's a medical profession somebody's in a techie you know everybody says they're so busy in today's world and and the person came in front of you what is the exercise regime that you would tell them to do I tell them that I I want you to do 30 minutes of brisk walking every day that's all and in that I tell them how to go about it I said if you're in a park first round relaxed you will do it in a park you will wear good shoes you will walk on kacha soil not on a hard track you will do bris so first round is relaxed that is warm up then you increase your speed and at till the speed where you're starting to get breathless then slow down a little that's your Rhythm do 5 minutes at fast pace and then one round to relax so start with five minutes of brisk walking after after a week 10 minutes after a week 15 minutes so you have to reach 30 minutes of brisk walk I don't want you to go go to the gym your body will tell you your nutrition will tell you now I'm ready to exercise in the gym awesome advice doctor for everyone to follow in India start slow and steady in 2024 when you start making a resolution this is the way to start now doctor you are a surgeon you're an aesthetic surgeon plastic surgeon you change people from outside but you're also very passionate about diet you're very passionate what exercise does nutrition affect our gut health and our digestion yes absolutely um uh the uh so I tell them it has to be a balanced right you have to have fiber you have to have green vegetables you know colored vegetables are the key to your vitamin health and then one more thing it is there that uh I always uh take glutamine in my workout drink glutamine my favorite amino acid yes it is a it is the exclusive food for our gut cells ocytes ocytes do not consume anything else other than glutamine so glutamine is an excellent thing for gut health uh lot of cancer uh medical oncologists use it for their patients it also enhances good recovery of the muscle so glutamine supplementation enough fiber in your diet enough water see uh you need water and fiber both to get the gut rolling so that you move the bowel and what people don't do is they don't drink enough water so I think a little bit of exercise to have gravity shake you up a little bit of water a little bit of glutamine little bit of fiber uh but doctor you know I as a nutritionist I've been uh telling people in the older days we ate out once a quarter because Daddy got some money and we could go to this Posh Restaurant and then maybe about 10 years ago we ate out once a month about five years ago everyone's eating out once a week now everyone's using the click of a button and ordering all of these online Foods I'm sure you see it with the younger doctors in your hospital so are you a doctor that promotes a tiffen box carrying order out from these apps from a digestive point of view what's your take so I believe that if you carry your food you will eat it if you're not carrying food you will eat whatever is available and that that may not be healthy so so that is the uh most important thing about food what happens Ryan is that once you start building muscle bulk you feel the need to have enough protein in your food and if you don't get it you get upset we go to parties and there are two three of us like-minded people we are hunting for protein so you have to have enough protein you have to have some carbohydrates you have to have enough greens and salads and you're done so if even if you sometimes have to order order something which contains all of these rather than saying no I'll order some maybe chart or a burger or something order a sandwich order a multigrain sandwich you will have fish in that uh with salad and is good and uh you can order healthy food but it should be in your mind that I want to eat healthy is it true doctor because I read one study that says when people are the most stressed out or most short of time they're very hangry and they make the worst decisions to order the most unhealthy food at that moment yeah these are people who are not loving their bodies see I said I push my body every day to the extreme cuz you love body I now eat unhealthy I mean why am I doing all this if I'm not going to feed it so I feed my body I feed my muscles I feed my health so if Dr kulp was a vehicle or a car he'd be a Rolls-Royce and he would be telling everyone my body is the most expensive real estate I own I live in it as a landlord I don't live in it as a tenant would you say that's true Dr K AB absolutely I
