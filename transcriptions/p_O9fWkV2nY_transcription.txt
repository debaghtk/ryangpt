Transcript: I eat early dinner and I think it's doing wonders to my health by 5:30 6 dinner's done but I feel like I rest better I sleep better all my sleep issues are gone I wake up fresher I have more energy I think clearer I would attribute that to eating early because that's the only change really that I've made in my life look at her schedule she's finishing eating by 5 to 6:00 p.m. there is a research why you should eat earlier your circadian rhythm gets better now if you can't finish at 6:00 in the evening try and finish it by 7:00 in the evening it allows 3 hours of digestion of food before you hit the bed by 10:00 at night so your liver is getting a chance to detoxify and did you know that deep sine wave sleep is better when you have eaten earlier in the evening so my former client followed these steps of eating early and going to bed early to get a better weight management and a better skin glow
