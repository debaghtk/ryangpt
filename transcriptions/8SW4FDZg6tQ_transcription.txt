[8.00 - 13.56] about one in six women with breast
[11.16 - 15.20] cancer don't experience a lump at all
[13.56 - 17.76] that's why it's crucial to understand
[15.20 - 20.20] the broad spectrum of symptoms breast
[17.76 - 22.60] cancer occurs when breast cells mutate
[20.20 - 24.64] and grow uncontrollably potentially
[22.60 - 26.60] spreading to nearby lymph nodes and
[24.64 - 29.20] Beyond once it spreads to other parts of
[26.60 - 31.28] the body it becomes metastatic breast
[29.20 - 33.60] cancer which is incurable early
[31.28 - 35.52] diagnosis however can save lives in
[33.60 - 37.56] today's video I'll guide you through
[35.52 - 39.80] five early signs of breast cancer you
[37.56 - 42.44] should never ignore let's get started
[39.80 - 44.48] symptom one unexplained lump most women
[42.44 - 46.64] associate breast cancer with a lump in
[44.48 - 49.20] the breast or armpit and it is indeed
[46.64 - 51.56] one of the most common symptoms however
[49.20 - 53.80] as I mentioned earlier one in six women
[51.56 - 56.08] don't experience a lump at all if you do
[53.80 - 57.52] find a lump though especially if it is
[56.08 - 59.48] hard or feels different from the
[57.52 - 61.72] surrounding tissue it's important to get
[59.48 - 63.96] it checked it could be a benign
[61.72 - 66.64] condition but it's better to be safe
[63.96 - 68.84] symptom two nipple discharge watch out
[66.64 - 70.68] for any unusual nipple discharge
[68.84 - 72.88] especially if it's bloody or clear
[70.68 - 75.24] nipple discharge without squeezing or
[72.88 - 77.32] discharge occurring in only one breast
[75.24 - 79.52] is concerning and should be looked at by
[77.32 - 81.60] a doctor while many cases are due to
[79.52 - 84.24] infection or other conditions early
[81.60 - 86.40] detection is key symptom three dimpling
[84.24 - 88.60] or skin changes dimpling on the breast
[86.40 - 90.60] or irritation that makes your skin look
[88.60 - 92.84] like the texture of an or Orange Peel
[90.60 - 94.88] can also be a sign of breast cancer it's
[92.84 - 96.60] easy to dismiss these as minor skin
[94.88 - 98.40] changes but they could be signaling
[96.60 - 101.00] something serious happening beneath the
[98.40 - 103.28] surface symptom four nipple changes if
[101.00 - 105.88] your nipples start to turn inwards pull
[103.28 - 108.08] to one side or change direction don't
[105.88 - 110.28] ignore it nipple changes are one of the
[108.08 - 112.52] more visible signs of breast cancer
[110.28 - 114.52] while they can also happen due to other
[112.52 - 116.08] conditions you should consult a
[114.52 - 118.60] healthcare provider for further
[116.08 - 121.08] evaluation symptom five skin irritation
[118.60 - 123.48] or redness finally irritation or redness
[121.08 - 125.72] of the skin around the breast which
[123.48 - 127.96] doesn't go away could indicate an
[125.72 - 130.16] underlining issue though many changes
[127.96 - 132.12] are due to hormonal fluctuations
[130.16 - 135.28] persistent changes should be discussed
[132.12 - 138.76] with your doctor as you age your risk of
[135.28 - 141.64] breast cancer increases in fact about
[138.76 - 143.96] 77% of women diagnosed with breast
[141.64 - 146.72] cancer are over the age of 50
[143.96 - 148.96] additionally less than 1% of the women
[146.72 - 152.08] are in their 20s are diagnosed with the
[148.96 - 154.20] disease you risk also doubles if you
[152.08 - 156.40] have a close relative like a mother
[154.20 - 158.76] sister or daughter who's had breast
[156.40 - 161.84] cancer if two close relatives have had
[158.76 - 164.48] breast cancer your risk increases
[161.84 - 167.28] fivefold these factors make regular
[164.48 - 169.52] screening and mammograms essential for
[167.28 - 171.72] early detection if you started
[169.52 - 174.24] menstruating your period was before the
[171.72 - 176.96] age of 12 or went through menopause
[174.24 - 178.48] after age 50 your risk is slightly
[176.96 - 181.08] higher because your breast tisue has
[178.48 - 182.84] been exposed to estrogen for a longer
[181.08 - 184.92] period there's also a clear link between
[182.84 - 187.52] alcohol consumption and breast cancer
[184.92 - 190.40] women who consume 2 to five drinks daily
[187.52 - 192.32] have a 1.5 times higher risk of
[190.40 - 194.20] developing breast cancer than those who
[192.32 - 196.84] don't drink early detection through
[194.20 - 199.52] regular self- exams and mammograms is

[199.52 - 204.40] breast that can detect cancer long
[202.16 - 206.36] before a lump is felt studies show that
[204.40 - 209.24] the women who participate in annual
[206.36 - 212.56] mamography screenings reduce the risk of
[209.24 - 216.04] dying from breast cancer by 41% and

[216.04 - 219.68] breast cancer cases now that we've
