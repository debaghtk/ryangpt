[0.08 - 4.72] hey guys if you're not able to watch my
[2.28 - 7.08] long form content of podcast here are
[4.72 - 9.60] some short form clips for you to enjoy
[7.08 - 11.68] doctor what are the remedies for acid
[9.60 - 14.24] reflux so my first question to you what
[11.68 - 16.64] is acid reflux and then who are the guys
[14.24 - 18.68] who are going to save us okay acid
[16.64 - 21.40] reflex is basically reflex of the
[18.68 - 23.16] stomach acid back into the esophagus
[21.40 - 25.08] reflex means what it comes back H
[23.16 - 27.60] regurgitation basically it comes back
[25.08 - 30.36] basically the acid should be in the
[27.60 - 32.88] stomach alone but unfortunately
[30.36 - 34.80] something has happened where the spinter
[32.88 - 36.76] muscle there is a muscle at the end of
[34.80 - 39.04] the junction of the fot pipe and the
[36.76 - 41.44] stomach it is supposed to close it's
[39.04 - 43.16] like a gate it's a gate it's a door so
[41.44 - 45.68] if that doesn't close properly the acid
[43.16 - 48.44] comes back out so when you eat food goes
[45.68 - 50.68] inside the stomach the acid is secreted
[48.44 - 52.96] by the stomach and it gets broken down
[50.68 - 54.80] into small pieces correct and then the
[52.96 - 59.12] lots of acid is being secret because we
[54.80 - 61.24] heat a lot so what happens is if this if
[59.12 - 63.28] this door the door closes as soon as the
[61.24 - 66.24] stomach the foot goes into the stomach
[63.28 - 68.60] but if the door is open because acid is
[66.24 - 71.16] secreted acid comes back into the
[68.60 - 72.28] esophagus awesome there's a funny
[71.16 - 76.12] question we got from one of our
[72.28 - 79.20] followers okay my stomach speaking like
[76.12 - 82.28] in third person my stomach not me my
[79.20 - 85.88] stomach is not digesting G or fried
[82.28 - 89.40] foods if I eat those Foods I pass tools
[85.88 - 90.60] with mucus and I get lose motions what
[89.40 - 93.80] should we answer answer to such a
[90.60 - 95.76] follower so maybe he's very sensitive to
[93.80 - 97.52] those foots correct but isn't it common
[95.76 - 100.60] sense you e eat something it's going to
[97.52 - 102.52] slap you you should avoid it uh so there
[100.60 - 105.48] are two parts today one is if you eat
[102.52 - 107.96] more yes that is the so you mean to say
[105.48 - 110.52] that sometimes we can fly under the
[107.96 - 112.92] radar by eating lesser of that correct
[110.52 - 114.64] correct exactly so first thing to this
[112.92 - 116.56] person is that you need to decrease the
[114.64 - 118.92] fried fatty foods whenever whatever he
[116.56 - 121.00] is eating but let's say that he still
[118.92 - 122.64] has the problem in even after decreasing
[121.00 - 124.80] it that is where we say that your
[122.64 - 127.40] stomach is very sensitive we need to
[124.80 - 130.56] fine tune your stomach handhold your
[127.40 - 133.08] stomach and love your stomach back for
[130.56 - 135.28] those who are uninitiated but follow you
[133.08 - 138.80] and follow me what is the meaning of
[135.28 - 142.00] mucus in stools so mucus is the
[138.80 - 143.28] intestinal lining secretes some fluid
[142.00 - 145.36] it's like a sticky when you blow your
[143.28 - 147.36] nose that does it look like that mucus
[145.36 - 148.84] when you blow your nose is it a clear
[147.36 - 150.64] white mucus or is it like when you get a
[148.84 - 152.84] cold which is green mucus so it's
[150.64 - 154.04] usually ELO mucus and then you know we
[152.84 - 157.16] see that while we are doing the
[154.04 - 159.96] procedure colonoscopy so if I poty and I
[157.16 - 161.92] look down I should technically not see
[159.96 - 163.72] mucus with my stool and generally not
[161.92 - 166.44] yes generally not and if I see a lot of
[163.72 - 168.32] mucus it could be a sign of an problem
[166.44 - 170.52] it could be a simple problem like you
[168.32 - 173.88] know irritable bubble syndrome or
[170.52 - 176.76] something like that or it could be a uh
[173.88 - 178.44] relatively more uh um you know complex
[176.76 - 180.60] problem like inflammatory bubble disease
[178.44 - 182.44] like runes disease or alcer is when you
[180.60 - 184.52] were in Medical College were you given
[182.44 - 187.24] stool samples to look at and see what is
[184.52 - 189.88] mucus and what is without mucus and I
[187.24 - 189.88] absolutely lowed
[190.12 - 194.20] it I got a gut feeling I want to really
[192.68 - 196.40] enjoy your profession for the rest of
[194.20 - 199.24] your life
[196.40 - 201.44] absolutely okay so the reason I'm asking
[199.24 - 202.92] these questions is because uh you know
[201.44 - 205.00] oh one one thing it's the most more than
[202.92 - 206.76] mucus the most important thing is blood
[205.00 - 207.96] oh we shouldn't see blood right Whenever
[206.76 - 209.36] there is there are two types of blood
[207.96 - 211.04] right fresh blood and old blood or
[209.36 - 213.60] something like that H can you tell us
[211.04 - 216.92] about that yeah so more than mucus blood
[213.60 - 219.40] and stool is considered as a red flag so
[216.92 - 221.64] fresh blood would look like red blood
[219.40 - 223.80] huh so blood stool is could be bright
[221.64 - 226.32] red yes what what is that problem like
[223.80 - 229.72] most likely it is hemorrhoids you got to
[226.32 - 233.04] understand that we can get skin problems
[229.72 - 234.00] inside our gastrointestinal system and
[233.04 - 236.16] it could
[234.00 - 237.20] bleed yeah yeah so what if I bleed in
[236.16 - 239.20] the
[237.20 - 242.12] stomach then the color of my stool
[239.20 - 243.48] changes to Black so if I look at black
[242.12 - 245.16] and and when we're talking about black
[243.48 - 247.64] what is black like this black like my
[245.16 - 250.16] hair like the mic black no my I don't
[247.64 - 253.60] have hair but still if you have or this
[250.16 - 255.44] might black it turns that black dark so
[253.60 - 257.04] normally stool is brown in color light
[255.44 - 259.32] brown dark brown the reason that is
[257.04 - 262.24] black is if there is a bleeding in the
[259.32 - 264.56] stomach the acid digests the blood which
[262.24 - 267.12] is red in color that turns into black
[264.56 - 269.76] and comes down the intestine so those of
[267.12 - 272.60] you who got a black tongue and black sto
[269.76 - 275.36] will see Dr Paul immediately no see a
[272.60 - 276.56] good doctor locally as well we don't
[275.36 - 279.08] need to wait for him to fly down to
[276.56 - 280.88] America but these are things that people
[279.08 - 283.88] actually never discuss at the dining
[280.88 - 285.48] table or in families like I would share
[283.88 - 289.00] something very intimate with you and the
[285.48 - 293.08] followers around 10 years ago I had
[289.00 - 295.12] hemorrhoids and uh it was one and um you
[293.08 - 296.72] know I took a lot of turmeric supplement
[295.12 - 298.96] and lot of Omega and lot of protein
[296.72 - 300.64] powder no fiber and I guess I started
[298.96 - 303.96] getting blood in my
[300.64 - 305.48] stools so I kind of got it treated uh
[303.96 - 306.80] with the rubber band kind of thing and
[305.48 - 309.48] it the doctor explains it's a very
[306.80 - 311.28] harmless procedure and got it done very
[309.48 - 314.04] interesting is why am I telling everyone
[311.28 - 315.40] about this is when I went to my mom and
[314.04 - 317.36] I said I'm going in for a medical
[315.40 - 320.68] procedure which is very simple and I'd
[317.36 - 323.16] be out in 2 hours she said I also have
[320.68 - 326.64] hemorrhoids like okay uh your
[323.16 - 327.84] grandfather also had it and then I was
[326.64 - 329.92] like what about your brothers and
[327.84 - 332.16] sisters I never asked them so I picked
[329.92 - 335.52] up the phone and started calling all my
[332.16 - 337.56] uncle and aunties and Chacha and chachis
[335.52 - 339.28] and everything and guess what Dr pal
[337.56 - 342.28] everybody everybody had it and everyone
[339.28 - 344.68] was silent about it so is it true that
[342.28 - 347.24] people don't discuss their bowel M and
[344.68 - 349.80] gut problems and it's it's a very like a
[347.24 - 353.08] taboo topic yeah absolutely and that's
[349.80 - 355.28] why I combine humor into this very taboo
[353.08 - 357.20] topic what's your biggest joke to to a
[355.28 - 361.36] patient on the table I said welcome to
[357.20 - 364.56] the office of gut and butt gut and butt
