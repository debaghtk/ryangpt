[63.52 - 68.72] today's day and age a lot of the
[65.52 - 71.24] so-called manufacturers of beverages are
[68.72 - 73.52] looking at labeling their food as health
[71.24 - 75.60] foods packaging it and trying to sell it

[112.04 - 117.68] is fasting is known to destroy cancer
[115.32 - 120.64] cells did you know that one of the
[117.68 - 123.44] leading Nobel Prize laurates won the
[120.64 - 127.28] Nobel Prize for his research a Japanese
[123.44 - 130.76] doctor on autoag autoag means clean up
[127.28 - 132.92] of cells when cells mutations happen at
[130.76 - 135.36] the DNA level where the cell becomes a
[132.92 - 137.28] Gunda and says I'm not going to die out
[135.36 - 140.16] naturally I'm going to behave like this
[137.28 - 144.16] Gunda and cause more Gunda cells more
[140.16 - 146.64] cancerous cells to be formed then I need
[144.16 - 150.12] to step in how do you step in you step
[146.64 - 152.16] in by fasting you don't feed these Gunda
[150.12 - 154.20] these cancer cells with sugar so the
[152.16 - 156.00] problem is in today's day and age you
[154.20 - 158.60] and I are clicking too much on our
[156.00 - 161.44] e-commerce apps too much of sugar in the
[158.60 - 162.92] IPL too much of food in the IPL why IPL
[161.44 - 164.88] when I'm watching TV I'm distracted I
[162.92 - 166.80] want to eat chips I want to eat soda I
[164.88 - 169.64] want to eat uh all of these things that
[166.80 - 172.28] are adding calorie burden now if you and
[169.64 - 174.64] I lived 1,000 years ago why 1,000 years
[172.28 - 177.40] 200 years ago there was no TV there was
[174.64 - 178.96] no electricity so we went to sleep by
[177.40 - 181.80] 7:00 in the evening so we were not
[178.96 - 184.64] eating extra this eating extra is
[181.80 - 186.52] compounding the sugar fueling of these
[184.64 - 188.28] cancerous cells over a period of time
[186.52 - 190.44] now initially in your younger years you
[188.28 - 192.08] have the necessary battling cells the
[190.44 - 194.36] soldier cells in your body to go and
[192.08 - 199.12] punch these cancer cells out but as you
[194.36 - 201.16] grow older 45 55 65 75 these cancer
[199.12 - 203.52] cells become more dominant and your
[201.16 - 205.72] soldier cells become less empowered
[203.52 - 208.48] because your dietary eating patterns are
[205.72 - 211.00] cultural not scientific so I would
[208.48 - 212.80] request all people to meet a medical
[211.00 - 215.92] dietitian at some point in their life
[212.80 - 220.28] and learn the art of medical fasting the
[215.92 - 223.36] key is here 30 hours of fast water is
[220.28 - 225.24] allowed in your fasting okay any te
[223.36 - 228.72] beverages are allowed in your fasting no
[225.24 - 230.72] sugar at all no carbohydrates at all if
[228.72 - 232.48] you have the affordability put a CGM
[230.72 - 234.84] device your sugar level should begin to
[232.48 - 237.76] drop in this 30 hour fast when you get
[234.84 - 240.64] up the next morning you have now choked
[237.76 - 242.08] out all the cancer cells because at 24
[240.64 - 243.60] hours they're saying the next meal is
[242.08 - 245.64] coming we're going to get a sugar let's
[243.60 - 247.76] hold on let's survive our cancer cells
[245.64 - 250.00] can become stronger weak on weak this if
[247.76 - 252.36] you do will be your own municipality

[252.36 - 256.68] plastic bottles for drinking water avoid
[254.76 - 258.88] microplastics avoid microwaving your
[256.68 - 260.36] food no candles in your house all of
[258.88 - 262.76] these candles with all of these Aromas
[260.36 - 264.96] and flavors are creating carcinogenic
[262.76 - 267.16] elements put in air filter in your car
[264.96 - 269.56] put an air filter in your hole pollution
[267.16 - 270.68] adds to your cancer juga that happens in
[269.56 - 272.80] your your body because you're sending in
[270.68 - 274.96] wrong free radicals into your body so
[272.80 - 277.40] there's a lot we can discuss but ideally
[274.96 - 279.36] speaking start small your body is the
[277.40 - 281.48] most expensive real estate you own you
