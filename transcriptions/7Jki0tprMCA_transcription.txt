Transcript: hey everyone uh a video very quickly on performance wire nutrition now as a nutritionist i control protein carbs fats vitamins minerals water now to enhance performance in anybody from marathon runners to triathlon people we want to look at air now how do we breathe and and a lot of times when i do nutrition counseling i look at um how can i measure the lung capacity so let's talk about the lungs the lungs are two empty sacs inside your thoracic cavity at the bottom here you have you have what is called as the diaphragm right so when you breathe the diaphragm pulls down and your lungs inflate so i want to share with you uh my screen today uh and i wanted to walk you through very quickly uh how you can you can imagine your lungs are working so if you look at this over here uh your lungs they inflate right you have intercostal muscles near the side of your ribs and you have the diaphragm and the bronchioles are all of these beautiful network which go to alveoli right so if if i can just spaws it at the alveoli you have like almost huge football fields of these bronchioles if you if you spread them out and this is where the oxygen and the carbon dioxide get exchanged at these guys the alveoli now for every athlete if i want to improve performance alveoli is in touch with the blood blood i have to look at the blood biochemistry but i can also look at improving the surface area of the oxygen going into the alveoli so from this perspective what i wanted to do today is i want to show you something that i use to train the athletes on which is to check their lung capacity so um i'm going to do a quick test today of my lungs and you know you're going to join me and i'm going to explain to you how we can do the the lung test today so i hope i'm in view today uh this is me so there's a speedometer over here to check your lung test okay now over here i've got the flow which is liters per second and here's the volume now every time an athlete anytime a client comes to me i am measuring not only height weight body fat percentage blood chemistry uh but i'm also not only looking at genetics and microbiome i'm also looking at the lung function how can you measure your efficiency of breathing every time you come in obviously you go out and you train it every time but let's check my lungs today okay so i'm going to do uh inspiratory muscle training now we breathe in through our nose and exhale through our mouth so inspiration on this device is through the mouth because if you're an athlete how do you breathe a lot of time people go and they do the spirometer you blow out you don't breathe oxygen in that way so inspiratory muscle training was discovered by some scientist in uk and they said they developed a device called the power breath and the power breadth said that i can measure your lung capacity i got the device here in india i measure my athlete's lung lung capacity so this is how it works you take in rapidly you exhale slowly so let's watch this lung speedometer over here okay so here goes so you can see uh my personal best has been 21.6 right and that's my flow now i want to show you when an athlete comes to me i'm looking at load i'm looking at energy i'm looking at inspirative flower watch inspiratory flow okay which is in this tangent over here okay so i'm gonna do a very low breath so i didn't i didn't inhale properly so you can see how that graph went okay now let's do this with a solid breath okay yeah power breath training is i measure 30 breaths every time the athlete comes across to me here at our clinic so let's go you can see i raised down the pressure or load of water because i got a bit of i think a background cold from last week spiral so i can feel that cold in there but you can look at a bad breath okay can you see that chuck chuck chuck right so the whole idea is now if i measure these 30 breaths okay so so far i've done only 10 on 30 breaths i will take a long time to do all the breaths but let me do a last nice breath come back to my uh basic view i don't know i don't want to show you a lot but if you look over here there's the power you can see my powers come down and this is my volume okay so i'm gonna try and go for a good power and a good volume for the next five breaths you can really see that uh post the viral last week i had a bad viral my lungs are actually still congested uh i'm not able to go even close to my 12.5 my volume slow down so let's save this up and let me show you a comparison of my previous breaths um you know these are my four breaths the first day i did it and if you look over here you can see volume okay so the first time i did it can you see that 0.683 uh liters volume per breath that means each breath is 0.683 and then my peak was 2.46 liters and today my average is 2.129 so let me look at today's session i'm going to double click over there you can see my different breadth so you see when i was kind of doing those erratic breaths i had a 1.347 and then i really decided to push myself i said you know what last five breaths let me go for maximum volume capacity right so 2.53 but see how it tapered out so i check athletes with uh 30 breaths per session and you can see this one session where i got 2.4336 as an average so let's say you this you meet this ryan with volume and you meet this ryan with volume you can come to know the change so ideally speaking you want your athlete to increment to their peak volume capacity average volume capacity is about six liters for elite athletes the world record is at 12.5 liters for a british rule look at my load load is the amount of volume of water i can lift so i lifted 20 centimeters of water on average today but in the previous session i did 22 centimeters and then look at my flow my flow last time was three point three point two three three and this time it is 3.282 so if you look at that you know um my flow went up if you see my my load went really up and then i i lowered it down because i couldn't pull because my lungs were not feeling too good not a great day to make a video but you know what's my perspective over here my perspective is when i am looking at performance in the human individual right as a nutritionist i'm looking to enhance the diet right but diet undergoes metabolism or combustion in the human body which is the delivery of oxygen so oxygen can be delivered throughout the day doxygen can be also tracked during your sports performance so what my logic to every athlete out there is could you train your lungs stand alone without any physical activity you know it's like going to the gym and doing a bicep curl you train only the bicep but you're a tennis player you're a football player you do the power breath training to inspiratory muscle training to train your lungs with 30 breaths in the morning 30 breaths in the evening you improve the alveoli surface area so i still remember when robin did this the cricketer robinhood did this long time ago he started off at a two liter lung capacity and went on to a six liter lung capacity right so by just connecting the the the neurons of the brain uh to the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles and teaching yourself how to breathe better like i mean for example i did this after three years of covet the first time right and we did just a few breaths and i was not able to pull it in because i really had forgotten how to breathe so then i went back home every day and then i practiced it and the next time i came back i was like yeah 2.46 now this is not something really great but by showing an athlete a drop or an increment in a graph you can really take the athlete to the next level for example i can even check my energy so uh i utilize 83 joules of energy in my best session but uh in my peak session uh which was the second session i actually used lesser energy because i was more efficient right so what i i'm trying to build for an athlete is the ability to monitor their output and if at a very young age at a very young age we can teach the athlete how to breathe better how to uh you know connect the brain to the breath pattern one is metabolism will get more efficient exercise will get more efficient think about it okay how do you remove lactic acid from the muscle lactic acid raises the ph in the blood and your carbon dioxide and oxygen are one of the what we call as buffer buffering systems so the more you have lactic acid the more you have to expel carbon dioxide that's how you get a lot of muscle burn your breathing right so you're throwing out carbon dioxide carbon dioxide lows down lactic acid so meat this guy breathing heavy 2.436 and meet this guy 2.12 which guy is eliminating lactic acid faster obviously this guy all right or for that matter you have a tennis player and you played a 30-40 point rally a rally of 40 rallies and you know get a point and now you're tired now meet this guy at 2.463 liter lung capacity and then meet this guy at 2.12 which guy will recover faster obviously the 2.4 so the whole idea will be from a physical supremacy point of view can you identify this to the athlete and enhance their performance and from a blood chemistry point of view i know that omega-3 i know that phosphatidylserine i know that of you know brahmi i know that butterhead lettuce beetroot help in vasodilation i know that lycopene boosts lung function and this is so much out there that we can do from enhancing uh not only the physical parabens of lung breeding but also the biochemistry wherein the oxygen and the carbon dioxide exchange happen so one for performance can you get an athlete to realize that their lungs are powerful can you get the athlete to realize that i've beaten elite elite athletes on this all right because they don't know how to use their lungs and then once i show them they're like they just get it they practice 30 breaths they do the inspiratory muscle training minus any exercise and many times they come back to me and they say oh you know what in the last 30 days i just did five days of power breath practice and i'm like okay come on let's check it out has your graph gone down has your graph gone up so this is me uh ryan fernando sharing snippets of my little bit of uh wisdom on how i enhance performance right from the guinness world record of non-stop aerobics to having won two olympic medals uh with olympic wrestler susheel kumar to now we're working with uh kenneth bednarek who's one of the fastest 200 meter athletes in the world performance well it's not just the food it's about what you go into the background and no one size fits all so whilst tomatoes may work for a can it it may not work for another athlete so everything is about data and how you take that data and analyze it you can watch my courses at www.institutenutrition.com where i teach uh about nutrition and supplements for a host of people uh or you can enroll for a nutrition plan with me at www.qawannutrition.com my name is ryan fernando i'm a sports nutritionist trying to make everyone fitter stronger faster better god bless you you
