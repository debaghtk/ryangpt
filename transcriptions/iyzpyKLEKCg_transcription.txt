[25.04 - 29.44] wrinkles growing older or how do I get
[27.52 - 31.84] more clear and radiant skin I remember
[29.44 - 34.08] when I met you in Mumbai for the
[31.84 - 35.44] aesthetic conference that I
[34.08 - 38.24] automatically assumed you were in your
[35.44 - 40.28] 40s your skin was glowing it had that it
[38.24 - 43.36] had that glow to it so what's your
[40.28 - 47.48] secrets to adding food in your diet so
[43.36 - 50.32] um I think what you have to do is have
[47.48 - 52.72] enough vitamins have enough antioxidants
[50.32 - 56.64] there is so much of free radicals being
[52.72 - 60.24] generated everywhere uh environment by
[56.64 - 62.88] the Sun and so many things that if have
[60.24 - 66.36] enough antioxidants you will do well so
[62.88 - 69.52] uh like I was talking I I consume uh one
[66.36 - 71.96] gr one gram of that amla extract vitamin
[69.52 - 74.20] C every day so for dinner when I sit
[71.96 - 76.08] down in my water I add one and I have
[74.20 - 79.00] that with my food so I'm doing that
[76.08 - 81.40] vitamin C is a brilliant antioxidant it
[79.00 - 83.88] is also a very strong immune booster it
[81.40 - 86.24] is a depigment it is something which is
[83.88 - 87.92] you know helps in almost every part of
[86.24 - 89.76] your body and that is one thing which
[87.92 - 91.68] has been with me and I always make sure
[89.76 - 93.76] that are enough colored vegetables in my
[91.68 - 96.12] food and that helps your skin I tell my
[93.76 - 97.88] patients nail is pure protein you need
[96.12 - 99.68] protein for the hair you need protein
[97.88 - 101.84] for the blood you need protein for the
[99.68 - 105.96] bone you need protein for muscle for
[101.84 - 109.84] everything hemoglobin is half globin and
[105.96 - 112.40] half he iron and protein so you have to
[109.84 - 114.20] make sure now since covid people have
[112.40 - 116.28] become more sensitive I do their
[114.20 - 118.08] nutritional profile when they come to me
[116.28 - 120.36] if there is hairfall if they have bad
[118.08 - 121.80] skin if they have acne I said you you
[120.36 - 123.40] have to at least know that your
[121.80 - 125.20] nutrition is adequate and they're
[123.40 - 127.36] surprised sometimes they fall see
[125.20 - 129.04] everything ha and then we sort that out
[127.36 - 132.68] slowly and they get into a better
[129.04 - 135.20] regimen of diet skin care nutrition
[132.68 - 137.84] exercise Dr Kip is wonderful talking to
[135.20 - 141.16] you today you know as a medical doctor
[137.84 - 142.80] surgeon expert any fascinating study
[141.16 - 145.36] that you have come across that will
[142.80 - 147.20] motivate millions of Indians which when
[145.36 - 149.00] you get your private clients coming to
[147.20 - 150.64] you and you're telling them correct your
[149.00 - 152.24] exercise correct your is there any
[150.64 - 155.72] fascinating study that you would like to
[152.24 - 157.56] share with our listeners yes so so there
[155.72 - 160.04] was a study published in the American
[157.56 - 162.88] Journal of nutrition and this was a
[160.04 - 165.96] systematic review of 50 studies and they
[162.88 - 168.28] had compared a high carb low protein
[165.96 - 170.72] diet to a low carb high protein diet and
[168.28 - 173.32] there were three distinct advantages
[170.72 - 175.16] which all studies agreed on one is
[173.32 - 177.28] eating more protein is thermogenic you
[175.16 - 179.08] need more calories to burn protein so if
[177.28 - 180.68] you just change your diet don't change
[179.08 - 185.20] your lifestyle at at all you will
[180.68 - 187.72] probably burn uh lose about 1.5 kgs per
[185.20 - 190.16] year just by changing your food second
[187.72 - 192.08] is it provides satiety third is it
[190.16 - 194.36] promotes selective fat loss so these
[192.08 - 196.12] were three conclusions of the systematic
[194.36 - 197.76] review uh published in the American
[196.12 - 201.08] General Nutrition and that has stuck
[197.76 - 202.48] with me it is such good satiety Cobbs
[201.08 - 204.44] the more you carobs you eat the more
[202.48 - 207.84] carobs you want to eat again because
[204.44 - 209.80] hunger is sustained rather than satiated
[207.84 - 212.60] so would you also say that fasting is
[209.80 - 215.24] part of your regime not fasting I I I
[212.60 - 216.96] don't really fast if I think I have
[215.24 - 219.20] eaten enough in the evening sometimes
[216.96 - 221.48] evening I come and snack then I skip my
[219.20 - 224.04] dinner and I just have a protein shake
[221.48 - 225.84] uh and go to sleep awesome and uh yeah
[224.04 - 227.32] that is good because then I balance out
[225.84 - 229.28] everything uh one thing I want to tell
[227.32 - 231.04] you we have a doctor's lounge and every
[229.28 - 233.28] day or every alternate day some of the
[231.04 - 235.56] other consultant is giving lunches you
[233.28 - 238.72] know daughter has got married we have a
[235.56 - 240.96] grandchild so what did I do I got 250
[238.72 - 244.24] bottles of milk protein shakes so I said
[240.96 - 247.12] this is lactose free this is no sugar
[244.24 - 248.64] and you will drink this and uh this will
[247.12 - 250.20] you know you will at least get a taste
[248.64 - 252.64] of what a protein check you have very
[250.20 - 254.88] bad impressions of how protein tastes
