[350.44 - 354.72] gopalan college in America there was a
[353.16 - 358.64] college called what was the name of the
[354.72 - 360.44] college I think it was Stanford okay so
[358.64 - 363.24] they did a basketball study everyone

[369.20 - 372.44] three-pointer yes so they told them to
[371.28 - 375.28] shoot a
[372.44 - 378.16] three-pointer now what they did is they
[375.28 - 381.72] told one group of the basketball players
[378.16 - 384.44] hey boss you all sleep 8 hours a day
[381.72 - 387.96] they told this other group hey boss you
[384.44 - 389.36] sleep 10 hours a day then they took all
[387.96 - 391.64] of these basketball players and they

[557.72 - 560.84] athlete today I'm going to talk to you
[559.16 - 562.52] about small small
[560.84 - 565.48] things
[562.52 - 567.88] so I worked with verat kohi I worked
[565.48 - 570.36] with verat kohi on his diet one of the
[567.88 - 572.44] most disciplined athletes in any sport
[570.36 - 575.36] I've ever met so when I told him once
[572.44 - 577.36] you need to have 100 G of WS he actually
[575.36 - 580.88] measured 100 G of WS he didn't measure
[577.36 - 583.24] 104 gr 100 G I'm sharing with you
[580.88 - 585.36] because Excellence doesn't come in
[583.24 - 587.48] cricket Excellence comes in your
[585.36 - 589.60] thinking first how many of you want to
[587.48 - 592.80] play for
[589.60 - 595.16] India right okay keep your hands down
[592.80 - 596.72] all of you want to play for India what
[595.16 - 599.64] are you doing different than all the
[596.72 - 601.72] other 1 million other boys out there
[599.64 - 603.48] what are you doing different than the
[601.72 - 606.96] other boys out there it starts with your
[603.48 - 609.44] thinking it starts with your thinking so
[606.96 - 610.96] if you want to be a Bugatti Veron if you
[609.44 - 613.04] want to be a Mercedes if you want to be
[610.96 - 616.36] an Audi if you want to be a Range Rover
[613.04 - 619.04] as a human body you can't drive like an
[616.36 - 622.68] auto R shop you can't think like an auto
[619.04 - 625.04] shop then you will be Auto R shop so
[622.68 - 627.16] please Focus I like the fact that you
[625.04 - 628.76] guys have bought books superb you want
[627.16 - 629.80] to take down notes you just need to
[628.76 - 632.20] remember one thing think on my
[629.80 - 636.32] presentation today what is that one
[632.20 - 639.52] thing I am the best in the world start
[636.32 - 642.88] thinking from here now behave as if
[639.52 - 645.72] you're the best so parents you need to
[642.88 - 648.00] call out your children so this part is
[645.72 - 650.36] for the parents the problem with Indian
[648.00 - 654.00] parents and I'm a parent is we get the
[650.36 - 657.36] best of equipment the best of coaches
[654.00 - 660.80] the best of turf best of everything but
[657.36 - 663.36] isaach child mentally tough enough to be
[660.80 - 667.40] the best because we give them the best
[663.36 - 669.44] of everything right my son is 11 years
[667.40 - 671.48] old he doesn't know how to operate the
[669.44 - 673.76] washing machine but the auto washing
[671.48 - 675.92] machine is automatic see you and I when
[673.76 - 677.68] we were born please remember we didn't
[675.92 - 680.12] have washing machine washing machines
[677.68 - 682.40] came after 1990 so all of us who are
[680.12 - 686.00] kids our parents taught us how to wash
[682.40 - 687.64] our clothes this generation put it in
[686.00 - 689.84] the washing machine press the button I
[687.64 - 693.92] will share an incident with you a kid
[689.84 - 696.88] went for a camp in Australia from India
[693.92 - 699.60] father Works in a billion dollar company
[696.88 - 703.28] he calls up his mom and is asking Ma how
[699.60 - 705.72] to operate washing machine 17y old what
[703.28 - 708.00] is the problem with us we don't teach
[705.72 - 710.36] our children to be ready for life so
[708.00 - 712.96] first start with mental grit don't give
[710.36 - 715.24] them everything make them learn and
[712.96 - 717.28] question them because it's very easy to
[715.24 - 719.44] say I want to play for India but when
[717.28 - 721.20] you're eating like a donkey you never
[719.44 - 723.28] play for India I'm sorry I'm calling you
[721.20 - 725.16] a donkey but I'm assuming most of you
[723.28 - 727.28] are very smart but if all of us were
[725.16 - 730.00] smart then everyone would be scoring a
[727.28 - 734.16] century every day so start focusing on
[730.00 - 736.76] your mental discipline okay so we talked
[734.16 - 740.32] about this training that's your
[736.76 - 745.12] department get the guy keep punching
[740.32 - 747.80] him okay parents let the coaches push
[745.12 - 749.40] your athlete let me tell you why I work
[747.80 - 751.48] with some of the top Olympic level
[749.40 - 754.48] athletes in the country so I work with
[751.48 - 758.52] Olympic guys and everybody else is Sada
[754.48 - 760.64] don't let your child get easy stuff let
[758.52 - 762.20] the coaches push them is very very
[760.64 - 763.64] important that's going to happen to them
[762.20 - 766.16] maximum what will happen they'll break a
[763.64 - 767.96] hand no medical Technologies they go
[766.16 - 770.44] repair the hand they have to push
[767.96 - 772.88] they'll get cramps give them electrolyte
[770.44 - 774.60] solution they get a headache give them a
[772.88 - 775.96] doo that things going to happen to our
[774.60 - 777.76] children but if you don't push them when
[775.96 - 779.64] they young they're not going to become
[777.76 - 782.00] Champions so whoever plays for IND
[779.64 - 783.64] has been pushed very hard you assume
[782.00 - 785.80] that you have sent your kids to the best
[783.64 - 787.96] Training Academy so they will become a
[785.80 - 789.32] verat kohi they won't become a verat
[787.96 - 792.28] kohi because of the best Training
[789.32 - 794.96] Academy they will become a Virat kohi
[792.28 - 797.60] because they have the mindset to become
[794.96 - 800.20] it so keep this in mind sleep and
[797.60 - 802.20] nutrition I talked about it you sleep
[800.20 - 804.64] lesser than 9 hours that's your problem
[802.20 - 807.24] you won't have mental focus now comes my
[804.64 - 808.52] department what's my department

[808.52 - 813.64] little bit about nut Nan what's my

[824.72 - 829.68] feet and a quarter of an inch
[827.64 - 833.32] okay what do you think is the ideal
[829.68 - 835.60] height in cricket between 58 and 6 ft
[833.32 - 837.48] above 6 ft if you grow as a bowler it's
[835.60 - 842.12] amazing because you're launching the
[837.48 - 843.84] ball so are you 51 510 okay put your
[842.12 - 847.40] hand
[843.84 - 847.40] up are you sure you're

[891.44 - 895.96] enough thank you
[893.44 - 898.12] so apples don't increase height huh by
[895.96 - 900.76] the way but apples are very good for
[898.12 - 903.60] potty another thing is when you'll buy
[900.76 - 905.68] apples as a team U there's a lot of wax
[903.60 - 907.56] coating on it so if you're buying
[905.68 - 909.92] organic for your kids and there's no wax
[907.56 - 911.72] coating they can bite it but because
[909.92 - 913.76] these are imported they have a wax
[911.72 - 916.08] coating so you have to peel the
[913.76 - 918.48] skin but if they eat the skin like that
[916.08 - 921.08] nothing will happen so everyone I want
[918.48 - 924.36] to grow taller how do you grow taller

[1585.40 - 1590.64] story so
[1587.24 - 1593.24] apparently Cal is spread by shaking
[1590.64 - 1594.52] hands and door knobs that's why I did
[1593.24 - 1597.08] that when I shook sir's hand I was
[1594.52 - 1599.40] getting I was scared of getting a cold
[1597.08 - 1602.20] so what they taught the British Olympic
[1599.40 - 1603.88] cycling team was to wash their hands and
[1602.20 - 1606.40] by washing their hands the correct way
[1603.88 - 1608.96] because he was a surgeon
[1606.40 - 1610.92] surgery the surgeons wash their hands
[1608.96 - 1613.76] properly so you won't get an infection
[1610.92 - 1616.20] so they taught the players the number of
[1613.76 - 1619.20] coughs and coals went down by half in
[1616.20 - 1621.20] the team you see when you get a cold how

[2024.80 - 2030.88] supplement no nothing but scientifically
[2027.16 - 2033.72] the blood is glucose salt which is
[2030.88 - 2036.28] electrolyte so my son is 10 year old the
[2033.72 - 2038.64] tennis coach is asking me sir your son
[2036.28 - 2040.48] is playing for one and a half far all

[2046.08 - 2050.48] minutes it's not because he's M he has
[2048.04 - 2053.64] more energy his body is getting
[2050.48 - 2058.24] dehydrated so guys I'd like you to begin
[2053.64 - 2062.04] to research what is sweat what does it
[2058.24 - 2063.88] contain and if you're losing water and S
[2062.04 - 2065.96] if you want to win matches and you're
[2063.88 - 2067.36] playing 4- day tournaments as soon as
[2065.96 - 2069.24] these boys finish your tournament Carry
[2067.36 - 2071.16] Your Wings scale so when you step on a
[2069.24 - 2073.68] weighing scale so let's say I go for

[2075.52 - 2084.28] match I'm 68 I lost 2 kgs what did I
[2079.32 - 2087.16] lose 2 cages of water salt glucose so if
[2084.28 - 2090.08] I'm not replenishing that in a match
[2087.16 - 2090.08] then second day
[2091.36 - 2099.00] match Third Day

[2193.24 - 2199.08] my son not to drink from water bottle
[2194.88 - 2201.56] and like example so parents it needs to
[2199.08 - 2205.08] be a vacuum by the way bet this is not
[2201.56 - 2209.48] vacuum open can you open for
[2205.08 - 2211.84] me open it forly what will happen is
[2209.48 - 2213.92] I'll tell you parents and children how
[2211.84 - 2218.00] will you know it's a vacuum Sports put
[2213.92 - 2220.44] cold water put cold water ice cold close
[2218.00 - 2223.56] it and if you put cold water outside
[2220.44 - 2225.60] will not become cold because the vacuum
[2223.56 - 2228.56] inside is preventing the cold from
[2225.60 - 2231.68] escaping also the heat from going inside
[2228.56 - 2234.12] so if the outside is cold like my my son
[2231.68 - 2235.88] come Papa check my my sports botle he'll
[2234.12 - 2238.12] touch it to my head ah it's nice and
[2235.88 - 2242.12] cold within half an hour room
[2238.12 - 2245.44] temperature so I want vacuum
[2242.12 - 2248.52] Sports so guys have you understood this
[2245.44 - 2251.76] part now next question question how many
[2248.52 - 2254.00] of you can drink cold water in this
[2251.76 - 2255.68] room how many of you your throat gives
[2254.00 - 2257.56] you no problem if you drink cold okay
[2255.68 - 2260.36] let me ask Ulta question how many of you
[2257.56 - 2262.56] get throat problem drinking cold
[2260.36 - 2263.88] water come to me Afters I'll tell you
[2262.56 - 2268.24] how to do it
[2263.88 - 2272.32] okay parents please from young age let
[2268.24 - 2275.00] your Bas bities drink cold water when
[2272.32 - 2276.96] they go for international thing the cold
[2275.00 - 2278.44] water goes into the body what is
[2276.96 - 2282.64] happening when you you're playing sport
[2278.44 - 2286.00] Body heats up heat how can I cool it
[2282.64 - 2287.88] water and cooler water goes to my core
[2286.00 - 2290.88] drops my core temperature my resting
[2287.88 - 2293.60] heart rate comes down so I am batting
[2290.88 - 2296.32] drinking garam garam P during water bake
[2293.60 - 2301.52] heart rate goes up I drink cooler water
[2296.32 - 2304.44] I have a 2% Advantage 1% Advantage so
[2301.52 - 2308.04] your water bottle preferably stainless
[2304.44 - 2309.68] steel is the best byy 2 lit and if you
[2308.04 - 2312.36] can find a water bottle that has a
[2309.68 - 2314.32] handle even better very difficult to
[2312.36 - 2316.72] Source but thumbs up to you if you can
[2314.32 - 2320.88] do it so I've designed a a sports drink
[2316.72 - 2323.00] called one Chase because 10 years ago uh
[2320.88 - 2325.64] I began to think I have a kid and I
[2323.00 - 2327.48] can't give my kid a commercial Sports Dr
[2325.64 - 2329.40] so can I design a product for kids so
[2327.48 - 2332.40] I'm giving all of you samples today you
[2329.40 - 2335.64] may try it out the idea is to improve
[2332.40 - 2338.28] hydration in the kids you may ask me is
[2335.64 - 2340.16] electral good electr is also
[2338.28 - 2344.76] electrolytes and
[2340.16 - 2349.56] glucose uh what is a top end bat what is
[2344.76 - 2351.96] a top end bat huh kabura kabura and what
[2349.56 - 2353.68] is a average
[2351.96 - 2355.52] bat
[2353.68 - 2357.64] huh okay so you understand the
[2355.52 - 2360.28] difference right average and top end so
[2357.64 - 2364.40] electrol is average top end would be a
[2360.28 - 2366.12] sports drink now don't mistake energy
[2364.40 - 2369.88] drinks with sports drink what is the
[2366.12 - 2371.84] difference a sport drink has 6 to 8%
[2369.88 - 2374.28] glucose so for mothers who want to get
[2371.84 - 2377.52] little bit smart you make a 1 lit
[2374.28 - 2380.00] solution you will put 60 G of glucose
[2377.52 - 2382.72] and fructose or maltodextrin to make a
[2380.00 - 2386.64] 6% solution all your energy drinks or
[2382.72 - 2389.04] juices are 10% plus that is too much of
[2386.64 - 2390.76] sugar which will activate the brain to
[2389.04 - 2394.60] go
[2390.76 - 2397.00] dealer whereas a 6 to 8% solution is the
[2394.60 - 2400.40] same concentration as your blood so when
[2397.00 - 2400.40] it enters the intin
[2410.96 - 2418.16] says so this is the construct of a
[2414.68 - 2419.72] sports Dr now let me go forward and I'll
[2418.16 - 2423.48] take questions today okay from parents
[2419.72 - 2425.84] and kids a lot of parents ask me
[2423.48 - 2428.08] protein you need to give three times of
[2425.84 - 2432.12] carbohydrate to one time of protein Rin
[2428.08 - 2436.12] very simple sir your kid is here not
[2432.12 - 2439.24] there okay your kid is here where is
[2436.12 - 2442.16] he hi what's your
[2439.24 - 2443.92] name
[2442.16 - 2447.96] ion
[2443.92 - 2450.44] huh your birthday happy birthday to you
[2447.96 - 2455.16] okay see I I I caught the right person
[2450.44 - 2457.88] okay so Aon do you know your
[2455.16 - 2460.44] weight he's 64 kgs
[2457.88 - 2462.08] Papa now I'm putting you on the spot how
[2460.44 - 2463.24] much protein do you think this boy needs
[2462.08 - 2467.00] per
[2463.24 - 2472.48] day no idea I'm going to help you you
[2467.00 - 2474.96] and I non aete require 1 gam per kg body
[2472.48 - 2478.48] weight so if you and I are 64 kgs we
[2474.96 - 2481.60] need to eat 64 gram of protein growing
[2478.48 - 2486.24] children athletes and pregnant mothers
[2481.60 - 2488.20] need 1.5 to 1.8 G per kg body weight so
[2486.24 - 2492.92] now somebody take the calculator very
[2488.20 - 2495.64] quickly and do 64 into 1.5 about 100 g
[2492.92 - 2498.64] of protein this young man over 5 meals
[2495.64 - 2501.36] in the day each meal 20 gram of protein
[2498.64 - 2504.64] will be what is his requirement so now
[2501.36 - 2507.84] what I'm doing for my son I'm like okay
[2504.64 - 2510.40] breakfast I and my my kid is only 30 kgs
[2507.84 - 2512.60] so it's a little easy for me now right
[2510.40 - 2514.28] so 30 kgs means I give 50 gram of
[2512.60 - 2517.72] proteins quite easy if I give him some
[2514.28 - 2521.08] French dose and two undas got I got 10
[2517.72 - 2523.52] 15 g of protein there but this boy
[2521.08 - 2525.56] you'll have to plan 20 to 30 G so he's
[2523.52 - 2529.08] literally actually daddy eating more
[2525.56 - 2530.44] than you so you got to figure that out

[2556.56 - 2560.60] don't know I'm not a parent of cricket
[2558.48 - 2562.64] but now I'll go to Wikipedia and Google
[2560.60 - 2565.60] glub how to do Cover Drive then I will
[2562.64 - 2568.96] do YouTube video of how to hit a cover
[2565.60 - 2571.56] drive but dude this is the expert these
[2568.96 - 2573.36] are the experts why do we have coaching
[2571.56 - 2576.08] why do we have teachers why do we send
[2573.36 - 2579.16] our children to school so they can learn
[2576.08 - 2582.20] I am what you call as nutrition teacher
[2579.16 - 2584.88] nutrition tutions so I design the plans
[2582.20 - 2588.00] for players I we also design the plans
[2584.88 - 2589.72] for children what's the benefit I will
[2588.00 - 2590.96] tell each one of you what is the benefit
[2589.72 - 2593.16] of working with a
[2590.96 - 2595.32] nutritionist you see and for everybody
[2593.16 - 2596.64] on YouTube also working with a
[2595.32 - 2600.00] nutritionist with
[2596.64 - 2602.20] children has a massive impact not only
[2600.00 - 2604.76] in the current growth but I'll give you
[2602.20 - 2607.20] an example of one of my children who
[2604.76 - 2610.60] went to American college so after the
[2607.20 - 2614.32] first year he came back his mother came
[2610.60 - 2616.60] and said Ryan sir I spent a lot of money
[2614.32 - 2619.40] on my child's annual nutrition plan with
[2616.60 - 2622.24] you but guess what whil all of his
[2619.40 - 2624.56] friends were boozing and drinking in the
[2622.24 - 2628.36] American college and eating pizzas and
[2624.56 - 2631.28] burgers my kid came back stronger with
[2628.36 - 2633.16] better marks and no alcohol in his body
[2631.28 - 2636.20] because you've taught the kid how to
[2633.16 - 2638.08] drive you've taught the kid how to play
[2636.20 - 2642.20] you've taught the kid how to think youve
[2638.08 - 2645.20] taught the kid how to eat so and a lot
[2642.20 - 2649.12] of times like my son goes to his own
[2645.20 - 2649.12] dietician because there's a saying in
[2649.64 - 2655.16] Hindi so children don't listen to us
[2652.44 - 2656.80] parents so don't even try my son will
[2655.16 - 2658.48] come Baba you know nothing about
[2656.80 - 2660.92] Minecraft so I've gone and found a
[2658.48 - 2663.64] Minecraft expert I said can you once a
[2660.92 - 2665.76] month talk to my son so please do the
[2663.64 - 2667.68] same for your children find an expert
[2665.76 - 2669.92] that can help them okay so everyone's
[2667.68 - 2671.56] understood how much of protein what's
[2669.92 - 2674.40] your
[2671.56 - 2676.24] weight huh how many grams of protein you
[2674.40 - 2678.00] need to eat everybody you got a pen and
[2676.24 - 2682.32] paper figure out how many grams of
[2678.00 - 2686.96] protein you need to eat 1.5 G per kg so
[2682.32 - 2686.96] if you're 37 37 plus half of
[2688.00 - 2693.48] 37 60
[2690.56 - 2696.88] G about 60 g of protein now you got to
[2693.48 - 2699.20] figure out is it do I eat 60 G in 1 meal
[2696.88 - 2702.52] or or all the meals you spread it out
[2699.20 - 2705.08] smart boy the human body 20 to 30 gam of
[2702.52 - 2706.80] protein more than that does not work
[2705.08 - 2710.12] parents do you think your children need
[2706.80 - 2712.28] a protein supplement either do yes or
[2710.12 - 2714.08] no coaches do you think they need a
[2712.28 - 2716.88] protein
[2714.08 - 2719.52] supplement but above a certain age let
[2716.88 - 2722.80] me tell you something the younger
[2719.52 - 2725.40] children don't need a protein supplement
[2722.80 - 2728.80] small frame the only time they need a
[2725.40 - 2730.00] supplement is when they are fussy eaters
[2728.80 - 2732.76] or small
[2730.00 - 2735.64] eaters but otherwise if your child is a
[2732.76 - 2737.44] good eater because they play so much of
[2735.64 - 2740.00] sports they need to eat so much of
[2737.44 - 2742.96] calories the moment they eat more they
[2740.00 - 2745.44] automatically get their protein so when
[2742.96 - 2748.60] the child is a voracious eater voracious
[2745.44 - 2751.16] means a foodie can really eat then
[2748.60 - 2754.12] thumbs up if your child is a small eater
[2751.16 - 2758.92] then there is a problem at that time try
[2754.12 - 2761.00] and figure out a me meal of natural food
[2758.92 - 2763.64] to be enhanced so like now my son will
[2761.00 - 2768.48] go and play tennis when he comes back we
[2763.64 - 2771.76] will grind up CH to make hummus he loves
[2768.48 - 2774.28] hummus but if I put something else in it
[2771.76 - 2776.76] it fills him up so what we do is we put
[2774.28 - 2779.52] hummus and peanut butter and he loves it
[2776.76 - 2782.20] so 5 tablespoons easily go into him I've
[2779.52 - 2784.28] got my 10 g of protein post tennis so
[2782.20 - 2786.44] you can do small small things like this
[2784.28 - 2788.68] mothers I'll give you the secret Google
[2786.44 - 2792.68] up please please list all the foods that
[2788.68 - 2794.48] will give me 10 G of serving in one meal
[2792.68 - 2797.80] it'll give you a whole list of it start
[2794.48 - 2799.64] with that this glutamine and BCA are
[2797.80 - 2801.76] basically amino acids that I give to the
[2799.64 - 2805.08] international players as a nutritional
[2801.76 - 2807.88] supplement the above 15 16 you can take
[2805.08 - 2810.40] glutamine and BCA below 15 you don't
[2807.88 - 2813.68] really need it top Super foods for
[2810.40 - 2816.32] cricketers beetroot increases oxygen
[2813.68 - 2818.88] carrying capacity beetroot increases
[2816.32 - 2821.12] oxygen caring capacity beetroot is best
[2818.88 - 2823.56] had 3 hours you can cook it you can bake
[2821.12 - 2825.00] it you can fry it you can juice it if
[2823.56 - 2827.28] you don't like beetroot that's
[2825.00 - 2828.80] absolutely fine how many of you like

[3015.08 - 3021.28] just went because it was cold it went in
[3018.84 - 3023.96] so you need to understand this huh when
[3021.28 - 3026.68] cold water touches your Buckle cavity
[3023.96 - 3028.04] there are all blood vessels here so you
[3026.68 - 3030.00] you see a lot of players with the helmet
[3028.04 - 3033.16] they'll turn it on and pour the cold
[3030.00 - 3035.80] water before you swallow hold the cold
[3033.16 - 3038.40] water in your mouth for a
[3035.80 - 3040.68] second so this all the blood vessels
[3038.40 - 3044.24] here get cooled down send cooler blood
[3040.68 - 3044.24] to your brain and your brain is
[3044.52 - 3049.12] like so then when you come back to bat
[3047.20 - 3051.00] inside the hot helmet sweating sweating
[3049.12 - 3052.88] sweating at least the brain has got 2
[3051.00 - 3055.64] minutes of Rive so sometimes when
[3052.88 - 3057.92] somebody's on 90
[3055.64 - 3059.40] runs
[3057.92 - 3062.52] got it
[3059.40 - 3064.80] ire everyone's getting it at that 90
[3062.52 - 3066.28] runs if you get that cool break it may
[3064.80 - 3068.00] help you those who get a s throat with
[3066.28 - 3069.96] cold water I'll teach you how to take
[3068.00 - 3072.80] care of your s throat so this is how you
[3069.96 - 3072.80] drink something that is
[3080.28 - 3085.68] cold
[3082.60 - 3088.60] ah get the picture now my brain is
[3085.68 - 3090.88] cooled down okay so sir have I answered
[3088.60 - 3093.88] your question they answer your question
[3090.88 - 3095.60] now it's not possible it's not possible
[3093.88 - 3098.96] to get 10 hours of sleep is what you're
[3095.60 - 3102.64] saying okay now 7:00 you have to get up
[3098.96 - 3105.68] so if you go to sleep at 10:00 how many
[3102.64 - 3108.60] hours are you getting bet is 9 hours
[3105.68 - 3109.72] better than 8 hours is 8 hours better
[3108.60 - 3113.88] than 7
[3109.72 - 3117.64] hours try and sleep the best that you
[3113.88 - 3120.80] can boss you want to stay awake
[3117.64 - 3124.12] after doni retires he will not sleep at
[3120.80 - 3125.20] all no problem but as long as doni needs
[3124.12 - 3127.44] to play
[3125.20 - 3130.40] cricket you think he's going to sleep
[3127.44 - 3132.84] any less you think Netflix is going to
[3130.40 - 3136.36] be his boss you think PlayStation is
[3132.84 - 3138.56] going to be his boss I am telling you I
[3136.36 - 3142.08] have worked with the best in the world
[3138.56 - 3144.52] and I can see it within 15 minutes of
[3142.08 - 3146.84] the counseling based on Behavior so sir
[3144.52 - 3148.76] you will see it you will know the verat
[3146.84 - 3149.52] in this team but we are too shy to tell
[3148.76 - 3152.72] the
[3149.52 - 3155.44] parents whose child is not a verat kohi
[3152.72 - 3159.28] because many of them are lazy in the
[3155.44 - 3161.92] brain lazy in the brain so parents and
[3159.28 - 3167.24] children listen in closely it is your
[3161.92 - 3170.52] parents god-given right to kick your
[3167.24 - 3174.36] ass it is your parents god-given right
[3170.52 - 3177.24] to kick your ass for you to become
[3174.36 - 3178.68] great it's your god-given right
[3177.24 - 3181.48] because there are millions of parents
[3178.68 - 3184.32] out there who do what we are
[3181.48 - 3186.68] doing it's okay he plays so hard it's
[3184.32 - 3189.72] not okay you want your child to play for
[3186.68 - 3192.76] the country be tough be tough on your
[3189.72 - 3195.04] kid I don't mean hit your kid but call
[3192.76 - 3197.00] them call them out so how I would call
[3195.04 - 3200.16] my kid tonight my kid wants to sleep at
[3197.00 - 3201.64] 11:00 IPL matches there you guys want to
[3200.16 - 3204.08] watch
[3201.64 - 3207.92] IPL and then you want to get only 6
[3204.08 - 3212.84] hours of sleep no sir but if I watch vat
[3207.92 - 3212.84] B then I will become vat Koh and sleep
[3215.24 - 3220.44] is by the way do you know that you can
[3217.52 - 3223.36] watch the match again next morning right
[3220.44 - 3226.80] your brain cannot be rewound but your
[3223.36 - 3229.64] Netflix and your IPL can be rebound so
[3226.80 - 3232.56] food for thought so I would tell my son
[3229.64 - 3235.08] like this happy birthday son but you
[3232.56 - 3236.76] know uh today's the IPL match what would
[3235.08 - 3238.72] you like to do would you like like to
[3236.76 - 3240.16] watch the match or would you like to get
[3238.72 - 3242.84] 10 hours of sleep because tomorrow you
[3240.16 - 3244.80] got a match and your son replies I'd
[3242.84 - 3246.48] like to watch the match because even
[3244.80 - 3249.64] with six hours of sleep I can play very
[3246.48 - 3251.76] well well I thought Ryan said that you
[3249.64 - 3254.44] know 10 hours they got a three-pointer
[3251.76 - 3258.04] strategy but you know best you're an
[3254.44 - 3260.40] adult and it's your life but if I was
[3258.04 - 3261.44] you I'd get 10 hours of sleep and then
[3260.40 - 3263.40] lead by
[3261.44 - 3264.88] example and that's the way we need to
[3263.40 - 3267.40] bring up our children parents if you
[3264.88 - 3270.56] lead by example you kids start watching
[3267.40 - 3275.96] you okay next question that's a long
[3270.56 - 3275.96] question on sleep next question yes
[3276.24 - 3281.56] better so this young man's question is
[3279.40 - 3283.84] are protein powders a good
[3281.56 - 3286.20] source protein bar is a good source of
[3283.84 - 3289.52] energy so what you do is the first
[3286.20 - 3292.60] question you ask is what is the food in
[3289.52 - 3296.72] the protein bar so mostly it will be whe
[3292.60 - 3299.96] protein soya protein egg protein green
[3296.72 - 3302.96] pea protein uh casine protein casine is
[3299.96 - 3306.80] a paneer protein uh it could be Chana
[3302.96 - 3310.16] protein it could be peanut protein satu
[3306.80 - 3312.88] protein the next thing you ask how much
[3310.16 - 3316.56] of protein in one
[3312.88 - 3320.76] bar 12 g of protein so they're showing
[3316.56 - 3322.16] 12 G so 12 G is pretty good right now
[3320.76 - 3325.32] the next thing you should look for in a
[3322.16 - 3328.96] protein bar is how much of
[3325.32 - 3332.52] preservative right so the next question
[3328.96 - 3334.76] is can I eat this at home why am I
[3332.52 - 3337.60] taking a protein bar is it because of
[3334.76 - 3339.40] convenience or is it because of taste
[3337.60 - 3341.92] mostly it says convenience sir I've gone
[3339.40 - 3345.08] so far away I can't carry Anda with me
[3341.92 - 3348.52] for 6 hours it will smell in my bag
[3345.08 - 3351.08] right so sometimes it's important to see
[3348.52 - 3354.60] whether the convenience
[3351.08 - 3357.84] overrides the convenience of eating
[3354.60 - 3360.16] fresh okay I hope answer your question
[3357.84 - 3363.36] sir I found a protein bar with 30 g of
[3360.16 - 3367.12] protein and 10 g of protein which is
[3363.36 - 3370.32] better more is not necessary less uh is
[3367.12 - 3372.36] better so it depends on the situation if
[3370.32 - 3374.72] you do weight training heavy weight
[3372.36 - 3377.60] training pull-ups push-ups leg press in
[3374.72 - 3380.32] the gym I would give you more protein
[3377.60 - 3382.76] Cricket training 12 gram of protein
[3380.32 - 3384.60] along with something else is pretty good
[3382.76 - 3387.00] have I answered your question I would
[3384.60 - 3389.64] prefer you to eat protein from natural
[3387.00 - 3392.24] sources but if that is not there then
[3389.64 - 3394.64] the alternative is to have a protein bar
[3392.24 - 3397.00] okay I do recommend protein bars to my
[3394.64 - 3399.28] athletes but only after they come to me
[3397.00 - 3401.56] they do a blood test uh I look at food
[3399.28 - 3404.28] allergy like for example you'll be like
[3401.56 - 3406.68] sir I found way protein bar but if I do
[3404.28 - 3408.40] your genetic test and your blood test
[3406.68 - 3410.44] and you're allergic to milk so it's very
[3408.40 - 3412.64] important to realize does that food
[3410.44 - 3414.44] agree with you so how you can know that
[3412.64 - 3416.96] if you eat a protein bar do you get
[3414.44 - 3418.72] gassy do you get stomach pain do you get
[3416.96 - 3421.72] pimples do you get
[3418.72 - 3423.16] acne you get heat boils so then that may
[3421.72 - 3426.16] be not good for you some people get
[3423.16 - 3428.28] loose motion if I eat a ve protein bar I
[3426.16 - 3430.92] get loose motions because I'm allergic
[3428.28 - 3433.72] to milk so I don't eat any ve protein I
[3430.92 - 3437.72] will have a hemp protein or a casual
[3433.72 - 3441.08] protein or soy protein B okay any other
[3437.72 - 3441.08] question there was some few yes
[3443.64 - 3449.80] ma'am boosting Foods height boosting
[3447.24 - 3452.52] foods are basically foods which are
[3449.80 - 3453.96] higher in protein but some of my
[3452.52 - 3457.52] favorites will be
[3453.96 - 3460.04] egg okay if you're a vegetarian I
[3457.52 - 3464.04] definitely would recommend satu or
[3460.04 - 3466.56] paneer but please note the problem in
[3464.04 - 3470.32] height is not from the
[3466.56 - 3473.16] food problem in his height first is
[3470.32 - 3478.12] father and mother's average height
[3473.16 - 3478.12] genetics but if the child is eating less
[3488.56 - 3491.56] examp
[3501.68 - 3507.92] s00 protein snack goes for Cricket empty
[3505.52 - 3510.52] tank finish ious Cricket so tired so
[3507.92 - 3514.32] exhausted we'll eat some junk food body
[3510.52 - 3516.36] boy I cannot grow so a balanced meal and
[3514.32 - 3518.84] I can give you an example I had a family
[3516.36 - 3522.28] who came to me for 6 months we give all
[3518.84 - 3526.12] the good nutrition protein powder sports
[3522.28 - 3529.36] drink grow but six years later the boy
[3526.12 - 3532.56] was the tallest in the family so growth
[3529.36 - 3534.84] for girls is between 9 and 12 how old
[3532.56 - 3537.76] are you better huh
[3534.84 - 3539.72] 18 now you focus on strength you focus
[3537.76 - 3541.80] on power you focus on your muscle okay
[3539.72 - 3543.60] are you taller than your mother Al your
[3541.80 - 3546.64] mother has fed you very well are you as
[3543.60 - 3548.60] tall as your father no had you come
[3546.64 - 3550.60] earlier then she could have put night
[3548.60 - 3552.48] but there is a certain genetic limit my
[3550.60 - 3555.72] favorites is beetroot for height growth
[3552.48 - 3558.40] Walnut almonds Pista Walnut almonds
[3555.72 - 3560.68] Pista Pista has the highest Arginine
[3558.40 - 3563.12] content arginine is an amino acid which
[3560.68 - 3568.04] helps in boosting nitric oxide pistas
[3563.12 - 3568.04] pistachos okay how many depends
[3568.44 - 3572.60] so we have to calculate the calorie
[3570.72 - 3575.56] requirement of each High boosting food
[3572.60 - 3575.56] any other question yes
[3578.80 - 3583.40] sir very good question boys grow between
[3582.08 - 3587.84] 14 and
[3583.40 - 3590.20] 18 boys grow between 14 and 18 some boys
[3587.84 - 3592.52] if they're lucky between 18 and 21 they
[3590.20 - 3595.04] will get little bit more height boost
[3592.52 - 3596.72] make sure boys you do hanging
[3595.04 - 3598.28] exercises
[3596.72 - 3601.20] hanging
[3598.28 - 3604.12] pull-ups all right the longer you can
[3601.20 - 3607.48] hang that will help in one inch or two
[3604.12 - 3611.12] Ines eat disciplined drink enough of
[3607.48 - 3614.92] water and parents please do a blood test
[3611.12 - 3619.68] for cricket players athletes
[3614.92 - 3622.52] 95% of all Indian children athletes are
[3619.68 - 3624.92] vitamin D deficient vitamin D is
[3622.52 - 3626.04] responsible for bone growth I'm touching
[3624.92 - 3628.88] my tie because this is one of the
[3626.04 - 3631.20] longest bones so if you get good vitamin
[3628.88 - 3632.80] D in your diet it's going to help you
[3631.20 - 3635.56] how much
[3632.80 - 3639.24] vam I cannot give the dosage for vitamin
[3635.56 - 3639.24] D unless we see the blood
[3641.96 - 3647.36] test the correct way to do it is you can
[3644.68 - 3649.48] either speak to a medical nutritionist
[3647.36 - 3652.08] or you can go to your family doctor and
[3649.48 - 3653.92] ask for the prescription of the dietary
[3652.08 - 3657.32] supplement next question you'll have can
[3653.92 - 3659.36] I get any food mushroom and eggs have
[3657.32 - 3661.32] small quantity of vitamin D but not
[3659.36 - 3663.20] enough if there is a vitamin D
[3661.32 - 3665.96] deficiency if there's a vitamin D
[3663.20 - 3667.88] deficiency your child needs a pediatric
[3665.96 - 3671.64] supplement of vitamin
[3667.88 - 3674.44] D L Arginine supplement for them it l
[3671.64 - 3677.20] arginine is amino acid found in
[3674.44 - 3679.64] pistachos and green peas
[3677.20 - 3681.08] mutter do they need an allinine
[3679.64 - 3683.68] supplement
[3681.08 - 3686.52] no it is better to take a protein
[3683.68 - 3689.44] supplement which will contain l Arginine
[3686.52 - 3692.16] in the protein naturally and the only
[3689.44 - 3694.36] time I will give L arginine is if they
[3692.16 - 3697.04] reach the IPL level because I'm
[3694.36 - 3699.44] constructing it for Vaso dilation so
[3697.04 - 3701.20] there's extreme lactic acid and I want
[3699.44 - 3704.28] the blood vessels to dilate to clear out
[3701.20 - 3706.72] the lactic acid so for the boys if they
[3704.28 - 3710.24] have done a rot of running and is fully
[3706.72 - 3715.12] tight eating po baji which is with a lot
[3710.24 - 3717.36] of green peas or mutter paneer or 10 15
[3715.12 - 3719.64] pistachos salted because they sweated a
[3717.36 - 3722.40] lot can really help you now was sir's
[3719.64 - 3722.40] question yes
[3727.72 - 3733.48] sir very good question so sir's question
[3730.84 - 3737.76] is I want to think of giving protein
[3733.48 - 3739.60] supplement to my child but all the way
[3737.76 - 3742.92] all the protein supplements in the
[3739.60 - 3745.96] market are they safe are they okay is
[3742.92 - 3748.60] the quality okay most of the proteins
[3745.96 - 3752.40] supplements are derived from a food
[3748.60 - 3755.76] source ve protein casine protein soyer
[3752.40 - 3757.24] protein hem protein green pea protein
[3755.76 - 3759.52] all of these so they take the food
[3757.24 - 3762.68] product and extract the protein because
[3759.52 - 3764.76] they are extracted The Taste is very uh
[3762.68 - 3767.24] so we need to put a lot of sweetener
[3764.76 - 3769.28] artificial sweetener which children
[3767.24 - 3771.60] shouldn't get artificial sweetener so as
[3769.28 - 3774.28] a pediatric Sports nutritionist what I
[3771.60 - 3776.08] try to do I try to give natural food if
[3774.28 - 3779.28] you're not meeting it I will try try and
[3776.08 - 3781.84] find a protein supplement which does not
[3779.28 - 3783.16] have artificial flavor I'll ask you one
[3781.84 - 3784.96] question you read all chocolate
[3783.16 - 3786.52] chocolate parents now every time you buy
[3784.96 - 3789.24] something and it says chocolate look
[3786.52 - 3791.08] whether it says chocolate flavor or real
[3789.24 - 3792.68] chocolate a product which has real
[3791.08 - 3794.92] chocolate will be in the thousands of
[3792.68 - 3797.00] rupees because you know how expensive
[3794.92 - 3801.40] real chocolate is so are we giving our
[3797.00 - 3803.88] children chemical flavor or you buy what
[3801.40 - 3807.44] is called as a naked naked protein
[3803.88 - 3810.52] supplement no sugar no flavor so for my
[3807.44 - 3814.88] son I buy a protein supplement it's like
[3810.52 - 3818.00] a Chana powder I put it into his coconut
[3814.88 - 3821.32] milk he's allergic to normal cow's milk
[3818.00 - 3823.84] then I buy cocoa powder put it in I put
[3821.32 - 3828.72] one teaspoon of sugar Hey sir how can
[3823.84 - 3830.60] you put sugar boss I put normal natural
[3828.72 - 3832.76] sugar they are children they have so
[3830.60 - 3835.32] much of energy they don't need asulam
[3832.76 - 3837.20] sucros and aspartame they need correct
[3835.32 - 3840.04] balance sir can I put honey inside of
[3837.20 - 3842.76] sugar yes can I put Jager yes you and me
[3840.04 - 3843.96] who are adults we don't need sugar
[3842.76 - 3846.40] because we're on the verge of getting
[3843.96 - 3849.04] diabetes so sir if I have to give a
[3846.40 - 3850.84] protein supplement in a public forum I
[3849.04 - 3854.04] don't say buy this supplement buy that
[3850.84 - 3855.48] supplement I kind of see the blood test
[3854.04 - 3857.96] I look at generators I look at the
[3855.48 - 3860.88] family background up nonvegetarian here
[3857.96 - 3862.92] so sir are you nonvegetarian vegetarian
[3860.88 - 3865.08] so mostly for vegetarian sometime then
[3862.92 - 3867.16] we don't be that you eat eggs sir if you
[3865.08 - 3869.60] give eggs then you can meet your protein
[3867.16 - 3872.28] requirement for a child under 60 kgs
[3869.60 - 3874.20] above 60 kgs we should teach him to eat
[3872.28 - 3875.76] a little bit more so he gets it from
[3874.20 - 3878.24] natural
[3875.76 - 3884.04] diet how many eggs can be given a day to
[3878.24 - 3886.56] a 60 kg boy where 64 67 see basically I
[3884.04 - 3890.40] I would give my kid about three to five
[3886.56 - 3892.80] eggs a day I would do two whole yolks
[3890.40 - 3896.36] two whole eggs the remaining will be egg
[3892.80 - 3899.52] whites but in children
[3896.36 - 3902.92] the only time I don't give whole eggs is
[3899.52 - 3904.72] when the family has a history of cholia
[3902.92 - 3906.80] meaning they have a family Gene of high
[3904.72 - 3908.84] cholesterol so I don't give that in the
[3906.80 - 3910.32] younger years so sometimes we do the
[3908.84 - 3912.84] Olympic Gene testing and they figure
[3910.32 - 3915.20] that out but for the safe side two whole
[3912.84 - 3918.04] eggs and maybe three additional egg was
[3915.20 - 3920.80] five can I give 12 well bodybuilders eat
[3918.04 - 3922.64] 12 I don't think you're so I would
[3920.80 - 3925.20] suggest so we have a team of sports
[3922.64 - 3927.56] nutritionist here in indran nagar I
[3925.20 - 3928.80] would suggest to parents invest in a 3
[3927.56 - 3931.68] months 6 months you don't need to come
[3928.80 - 3933.96] to me I'm very expensive okay come to my
[3931.68 - 3935.60] nutritionist and get it done but what
[3933.96 - 3937.88] happens is when you do it scientifically
[3935.60 - 3940.68] for your child you're able to get
[3937.88 - 3942.20] specifics first point second Point your
[3940.68 - 3943.52] kid doesn't argue with you because the
[3942.20 - 3945.80] gym trainers told him to take three
[3943.52 - 3949.12] scoops of way protein see because a Gym
[3945.80 - 3950.84] trainer has tried it on his body and
[3949.12 - 3953.32] taking three scoops of protein by the
[3950.84 - 3956.20] way do you know if it's affecting your
[3953.32 - 3959.20] brain Focus so I can do a very big
[3956.20 - 3961.60] conversation on this that when children
[3959.20 - 3964.20] especially teenage boys start putting
[3961.60 - 3967.64] more and more protein powder the body
[3964.20 - 3969.56] has to detox too much of protein and
[3967.64 - 3973.08] then the ammonia levels are little bit
[3969.56 - 3974.78] higher so the boy is very
[3973.08 - 3976.96] uh
[3974.78 - 3980.24] [Music]
[3976.96 - 3983.52] uh you need to be like on the field
[3980.24 - 3988.80] focused you don't need extra protein you
[3983.52 - 3990.28] need 1.5 G per kg body weight by not
[3988.80 - 3992.72] eating the correct food and putting
[3990.28 - 3993.48] three scoops of protein powder that is
[3992.72 - 3996.92] like
[3993.48 - 3998.52] saying that is like saying Ryan Fernando
[3996.92 - 3999.32] who has never even played Cricket for
[3998.52 - 4003.04] his
[3999.32 - 4006.56] school takes verat koh's B take Virat
[4003.04 - 4007.56] kohi pad I'm wearing all of his gear I
[4006.56 - 4010.88] can hit
[4007.56 - 4015.00] sixer that is what a protein powder is
[4010.88 - 4017.04] without the proper training of good Dal
[4015.00 - 4020.40] chavel Roy
[4017.04 - 4021.96] and and if you're non-vegetarian nonv I
[4020.40 - 4023.80] hope I've answered your question any
[4021.96 - 4025.80] other questions yes
[4023.80 - 4029.08] sir
[4025.80 - 4031.56] so very good question so sir's question
[4029.08 - 4033.04] is hey you want to leave if it's your
[4031.56 - 4035.96] birthday you got a thumbs up man happy
[4033.04 - 4038.12] birthday so very good question a very
[4035.96 - 4040.72] good question about a very very good
[4038.12 - 4042.60] question about water 60% of the body
[4040.72 - 4044.92] body is water we buying the most
[4042.60 - 4047.20] expensive watches most expensive
[4044.92 - 4051.56] everything but when it comes to drinking
[4047.20 - 4054.04] water my point is I in my own house I
[4051.56 - 4055.72] buy a more expensive water which comes
[4054.04 - 4058.32] from a spring or which comes from the
[4055.72 - 4061.36] mountain uh and my logic is very very
[4058.32 - 4064.24] simple if I can afford it I would choose
[4061.36 - 4067.20] a better quality water is alkaline water
[4064.24 - 4071.24] good we're looking for water that has
[4067.20 - 4074.40] natural mineral salts in it so you can
[4071.24 - 4077.60] buy glacial or spring water you can take
[4074.40 - 4081.12] Arrow water and put a pinch of Celtic
[4077.60 - 4083.16] salt or Himalayan pink salt in it now
[4081.12 - 4085.28] how much to put that I don't know so
[4083.16 - 4087.44] normally you can just put one crystal in
[4085.28 - 4089.72] a liter and hopefully that should help
[4087.44 - 4092.40] you out nowadays you get electrolyte
[4089.72 - 4094.68] salts which can dissolve in 2 L of water
[4092.40 - 4098.20] and you can make sure that in drinking 4
[4094.68 - 4101.12] lit of day maybe 1 lit or 2 L for sports
[4098.20 - 4103.52] people is also a electrolyte salt
[4101.12 - 4106.28] balanced water is alkaline water
[4103.52 - 4109.00] beneficial the answer is yes I do
[4106.28 - 4111.32] recommend buying a better quality water
[4109.00 - 4114.12] for your children or for any players
[4111.32 - 4117.80] last question for today
[4114.12 - 4120.04] uh so the question here is in the
[4117.80 - 4122.92] evening let's say after 6:00 in the
[4120.04 - 4125.28] evening there's a heavy cardio session
[4122.92 - 4127.84] heavy plyometric session like lot of
[4125.28 - 4129.84] running and everything the question is
[4127.84 - 4132.44] you need to take carbohydrates so coach
[4129.84 - 4135.68] is saying can I give some dates can I
[4132.44 - 4137.84] give some um fruit or something before
[4135.68 - 4140.32] the session starts carbal loading yes
[4137.84 - 4144.76] should I recommend a BC Arginine above
[4140.32 - 4149.24] 13 14 years of age um case to case basis
[4144.76 - 4152.24] a maximum of 2 G of BCA Arginine not
[4149.24 - 4155.36] recommended and let me tell you why BCA
[4152.24 - 4158.44] goes to the brain and activates the
[4155.36 - 4160.60] alertness so as they go to sleep the
[4158.44 - 4163.76] brain's not going into a deep sleep so
[4160.60 - 4167.20] all my players not only 13:14 after 5:00
[4163.76 - 4169.72] p.m. I advise them not to take a BCA
[4167.20 - 4172.52] supplement with the chance that it might
[4169.72 - 4175.60] affect their deep sleep cycle and it is
[4172.52 - 4177.88] in deep Sleep Cycle we release the S SW
[4175.60 - 4181.04] as sleep we we release growth hormone
[4177.88 - 4183.48] and stem cells so maybe when there 17 18
[4181.04 - 4184.96] once the growth hormone sport is over
[4183.48 - 4188.68] then we can take a BCF because it's
[4184.96 - 4192.16] tenis what can I give they could have an
[4188.68 - 4193.76] egg during the session simple
[4192.16 - 4197.04] carbohydrate and
[4193.76 - 4198.96] electrolytes cold water on the face more
[4197.04 - 4201.16] deeper breaths and if you want to
[4198.96 - 4203.04] increase the nitric oxide which is one
[4201.16 - 4205.80] of the reasons why we give Arginine to
[4203.04 - 4209.52] Vaso dilate the blood vessel research is
[4205.80 - 4212.20] now showing nostril breathing increases
[4209.52 - 4214.32] nitric oxide by a significant double
[4212.20 - 4216.52] digit level I can't remember it I don't
[4214.32 - 4219.64] remember if it was 12 or 14 but the
[4216.52 - 4222.08] answer is in James nestor's book uh
[4219.64 - 4224.04] called breath on page 22 where he did
[4222.08 - 4225.96] the cycling experiment and they found
[4224.04 - 4228.80] that one of the athletes who was mouth
[4225.96 - 4231.84] breathing with 44 breaths to complete
[4228.80 - 4234.12] the target did it in only 14 breaths
[4231.84 - 4235.80] with nose breathing so nose breathing is
[4234.12 - 4238.48] very very important for the future
[4235.80 - 4240.76] generation of athletes to figure out a
[4238.48 - 4243.24] better cardiovascular
[4240.76 - 4245.20] training very good question is there any
[4243.24 - 4247.48] age I can go to the gym or is there any
[4245.20 - 4249.72] restriction there is no restriction
[4247.48 - 4252.36] going to do any physical workout first
[4249.72 - 4255.52] of all in the gym you do a physical
[4252.36 - 4257.64] workout what the leading exercise
[4255.52 - 4260.84] physiologists in the world have said is
[4257.64 - 4264.56] children under the age of 16 17 try not
[4260.84 - 4267.64] to compress the spine or load the spine
[4264.56 - 4270.68] so like squats or heavy bar on top of
[4267.64 - 4274.04] your spine but all other activities in
[4270.68 - 4277.08] the gym which you may do with free body
[4274.04 - 4280.40] hanging weights or machines is
[4277.08 - 4283.56] acceptable provided your trainer knows
[4280.40 - 4285.92] exactly what is the end goal required so
[4283.56 - 4287.72] if you're going to the gym for overall
[4285.92 - 4290.00] Fitness your trainer needs to design
[4287.72 - 4292.24] your plan for that parents don't be
[4290.00 - 4295.00] afraid to send your children to the gym
[4292.24 - 4297.96] provided the trainer is really good if
[4295.00 - 4300.04] it is a housekeeping trainer and a lot
[4297.96 - 4303.56] of gyms have this housekeeping trainer
[4300.04 - 4303.56] but 6 months ago he was
[4305.84 - 4311.20] housekeeping they have to have a
[4308.92 - 4313.96] certification from some of the leading
[4311.20 - 4316.56] institutes in the world it's called a
[4313.96 - 4318.96] snc strengthen conditioning if the
[4316.56 - 4322.00] person is an snc certified person and
[4318.96 - 4324.32] don't be afraid to ask your trainer can
[4322.00 - 4327.00] I see a certificate I had a parent
[4324.32 - 4329.68] recently said Mr Fernando can I see your
[4327.00 - 4332.56] certificates absolutely and I was like
[4329.68 - 4334.72] absolutely you may be vat koh's
[4332.56 - 4337.04] nutritionist do you know Amir Khan asked
[4334.72 - 4338.76] me for my certifications so don't be
[4337.04 - 4340.80] afraid because it's your children you go
[4338.76 - 4342.32] to a coach ask the coach you go to
[4340.80 - 4345.60] nutritionist ask the nutrition you go to
[4342.32 - 4347.48] a doctor outside doctor put know mbbs F
[4345.60 - 4350.12] frcs
[4347.48 - 4352.04] MD then reference is there don't be
[4350.12 - 4353.36] afraid to ask your trainer because
[4352.04 - 4356.40] sometimes the trainer just has a good
[4353.36 - 4357.60] body but is not a sports strength and
[4356.40 - 4359.48] conditioning trainer which might be the
[4357.60 - 4361.44] worst thing for your child answer your
[4359.48 - 4364.40] question so it's okay for you to go to
[4361.44 - 4366.20] the gym provided you got a great trainer
[4364.40 - 4368.56] and under supervision and don't load
[4366.20 - 4371.96] your back with heavy exercises so you
[4368.56 - 4375.68] shrink your SP how tall are you beta 510
[4371.96 - 4376.76] 59 59 how old are you 14
[4375.68 - 4379.16] you'll cross

[4379.16 - 4385.00] father no then man you'll beat your dad
[4382.64 - 4389.76] you the
[4385.00 - 4390.56] dad and you're the wife stand up Aram

[4403.60 - 4408.32] hours now you now you know how to have
[4405.96 - 4410.72] the equation with him right Ryan said
[4408.32 - 4412.60] kind of 10 hours kind of and do one
[4410.72 - 4415.08] thing parents please sit down please sit

[4431.68 - 4437.44] record the videos him getting up at
[4433.88 - 4439.92] 10:00 in the morning all of that stuff
[4437.44 - 4442.20] do that you'll remember me when he's 21
[4439.92 - 4445.92] years of
[4442.20 - 4448.24] age guys what you need to do be the best
[4445.92 - 4449.68] at what you do there are few people who
[4448.24 - 4451.60] will play for the country how many
[4449.68 - 4457.72] people can play for the
[4451.60 - 4460.76] country H 15 15 out of how many billion
[4457.72 - 4464.20] people 1.3 billion
[4460.76 - 4468.36] Indians okay male and female 600 600 or
[4464.20 - 4470.60] 700 700 out of 700 million Indians 15 of
[4468.36 - 4475.20] you will have a chance to play for India
[4470.60 - 4475.20] is it you last question to the
[4475.72 - 4480.00] mom to
[4477.96 - 4483.36] the he
[4480.00 - 4483.36] just what are
[4491.32 - 4497.76] theh
[4493.84 - 4499.32] okay okay okay so m''s question and
[4497.76 - 4501.12] everyone listen in close and this is
[4499.32 - 4502.92] this is a learning for for Coach very
[4501.12 - 4505.32] few people in the world will tell you
[4502.92 - 4508.84] this I heard a lady break the Guinness
[4505.32 - 4512.32] World Record of non-stop aerobics of 26
[4508.84 - 4515.84] hours so all I did was to know she's
[4512.32 - 4520.00] hydrated or dehydrated I would watch her
[4515.84 - 4523.04] eyes so the eyes also contain
[4520.00 - 4523.96] water okay when the athlete begins to
[4523.04 - 4528.16] get
[4523.96 - 4531.88] dehydrated their blinking goes like
[4528.16 - 4534.20] this can you see my eyes but if the
[4531.88 - 4537.00] athlete is not dehydrated coach their
[4534.20 - 4537.00] blinking is like
[4537.60 - 4545.24] this one per 3 seconds is my equation
[4542.80 - 4547.24] this is my this is my realization over
[4545.24 - 4549.36] two decades as a sports nutritionist
[4547.24 - 4551.44] it's not there in any book or anything
[4549.36 - 4554.60] and the moment you see somebody
[4551.44 - 4557.12] going so this IPL guys watch all your
[4554.60 - 4557.12] players is
[4558.48 - 4563.72] batting I know they
[4561.08 - 4565.88] dehydrated so coach when you see the guy
[4563.72 - 4566.92] doing like coach how are you coach I'm
[4565.88 - 4571.92] very fine
[4566.92 - 4574.40] coach right like P bet have I answered a
[4571.92 - 4576.32] question and you also need to not give
[4574.40 - 4579.12] plain water because plain water
[4576.32 - 4581.28] dehydrates so if they're drinking 5 L of
[4579.12 - 4583.44] water in a day at least one liter needs
[4581.28 - 4585.24] to be a sports drink because you're
[4583.44 - 4587.60] giving glucose and salts because you're
[4585.24 - 4587.60] losing
[4592.16 - 4597.72] salts absolutely absolutely there's no
[4595.84 - 4601.16] problem he can be drinking water as he's
[4597.72 - 4603.08] running to get 100 runs if I think the
[4601.16 - 4604.60] future will be like this verat kohi will
[4603.08 - 4607.16] have one can here one can over here with
[4604.60 - 4609.96] a helmet the water will be there his
[4607.16 - 4612.36] be have you seen race car drivers
[4609.96 - 4614.56] they've got that if I could do that in
[4612.36 - 4616.64] every sport people would be able to play
[4614.56 - 4618.36] at the next level but what do you need
[4616.64 - 4620.40] to do wait for your water break so
[4618.36 - 4622.48] Cricket is a very demanding sport
[4620.40 - 4625.32] because you're restricted from taking
[4622.48 - 4627.28] water and when water really comes blah
[4625.32 - 4628.28] blah blah blah everyone's talking
[4627.28 - 4630.72] nobody's
[4628.28 - 4633.08] hydrating so you need to when the water
[4630.72 - 4634.76] comes in the Water Boy comes back if
[4633.08 - 4636.72] everybody's not got the water give one
[4634.76 - 4638.68] kick to the water boy I I mean in
[4636.72 - 4640.76] today's world we might be arrested sir
[4638.68 - 4643.04] you might be arrested I'm saying
[4640.76 - 4644.52] figuratively okay so ma'am unlike
[4643.04 - 4646.96] anything else that we were taught in the
[4644.52 - 4649.60] past yogic gurus and all don't drink
[4646.96 - 4651.68] water and all sports is different maam
[4649.60 - 4655.36] right so because the statement I will
[4651.68 - 4658.84] make to you is you need to learn to play
[4655.36 - 4662.24] a sport you need to learn to train for a
[4658.84 - 4665.92] sport right you also need to learn to
[4662.24 - 4668.60] eat for a sport you also need to learn
[4665.92 - 4672.60] to eat when playing the sport meaning my
[4668.60 - 4674.56] stomach should be able to receive dates
[4672.60 - 4676.96] my stomach should be able to receive one
[4674.56 - 4680.56] Chase my sports drink my stomach should
[4676.96 - 4683.80] be able to um maybe get a cup of coffee
[4680.56 - 4684.80] when I'm playing I have people who do
[4683.80 - 4688.48] ultra
[4684.80 - 4692.00] marathon 100 kilometers of running a day
[4688.48 - 4694.00] sir I can't eat sorry I'm running 100
[4692.00 - 4696.04] kilometers you you watch this on the
[4694.00 - 4698.48] internet they're eating and running and
[4696.04 - 4700.80] drinking when this so you train the
[4698.48 - 4702.80] stomach to learn that you can't do it
[4700.80 - 4705.48] suddenly but slow and steady I hope I've
[4702.80 - 4707.04] answer the question mic drop oh okay
[4705.48 - 4708.92] last question to my first boy of the
[4707.04 - 4710.56] question who answered the diet question
[4708.92 - 4712.76] correct okay what's your question what
[4710.56 - 4715.00] are the like energy givings during the
[4712.76 - 4717.48] session like what do we have during a
[4715.00 - 4720.76] session what are the energy giving foods
[4717.48 - 4722.32] during a session quiz for everybody what
[4720.76 - 4723.28] do you think are the energy giving foods
[4722.32 - 4725.36] during a
[4723.28 - 4727.64] session
[4725.36 - 4730.76] huh brown
[4727.64 - 4732.88] bread dark chocolate yes but one thing
[4730.76 - 4735.00] I'll tell you in a session if you take
[4732.88 - 4738.64] dark chocolate does your mouth become
[4735.00 - 4741.64] Uka huh so maybe dark chocolate in the
[4738.64 - 4744.28] form of a chocolate milkshake in a
[4741.64 - 4746.20] session so you can make a diluted
[4744.28 - 4750.16] chocolate milkshake and drink it during
[4746.20 - 4754.12] a session my favorite is dates
[4750.16 - 4756.36] dates one of my favorite peanut butter
[4754.12 - 4758.12] put on a piece of brown bread no problem
[4756.36 - 4760.48] if you're not allergic to gluten
[4758.12 - 4760.48] anything
[4760.96 - 4770.16] else casual good casual badam Pista kmas

[4785.12 - 4791.04] milkshake inside over here okay but
[4787.88 - 4794.00] learn to eat when you play coach allow
[4791.04 - 4797.32] them small more breaks because it will
[4794.00 - 4799.60] make your brain more alert in practice
[4797.32 - 4803.64] but children
[4799.60 - 4805.56] children players don't abuse the
[4803.64 - 4807.80] 30second break the coach gives you and
[4805.56 - 4810.04] make it 3
[4807.80 - 4813.48] minutes they have breaks of 5 minutes
[4810.04 - 4814.92] also okay so that's very good uh there's
[4813.48 - 4819.40] another reason why you shouldn't take a
[4814.92 - 4822.24] very long break focus focus focus break
[4819.40 - 4822.24] brain is like
[4823.20 - 4828.64] break I've gone now to Kashmir coach is
[4826.52 - 4831.16] like come back over here brain is like
