[0.00 - 6.54] which asked for monthly assessment
[4.62 - 8.79] quarterly assessment and annual
[6.54 - 10.65] assessment this is from a nutrition
[8.79 - 14.22] perspective now what do you ask is a
[10.65 - 16.38] coach you asked my dear friend you are
[14.22 - 20.04] with me playing what is your weight this
[16.38 - 22.50] month keep a track record what is my
[20.04 - 25.02] weight next month and like that whenever
[22.50 - 29.94] players come to me I have 12 months of
[25.02 - 33.84] data as a coach if your player is losing
[29.94 - 36.99] weight alarm bells should go off you
[33.84 - 39.90] need to see your nutritionist by the way
[36.99 - 41.46] this happens mostly in the girls because
[39.90 - 43.89] they are very conscious about your
[41.46 - 47.31] figure so they don't eat and they train
[43.89 - 50.79] a lot so they are burning muscle they
[47.31 - 53.31] are not burning fat keep this in mind so
[50.79 - 57.12] when you take this weight don't take a
[53.31 - 59.82] simple weighing scale it cost about $100
[57.12 - 62.31] for a nice weighing scale which will
[59.82 - 65.13] measure your muscle and fat percentage
[62.31 - 68.25] or but mr. Fernando there is something
[65.13 - 70.32] called the DEXA scan that is $100,000
[68.25 - 73.11] machine or we need that in our tennis
[70.32 - 75.63] facility I not required simple wings
[73.11 - 78.60] skill if you have data with you
[75.63 - 81.93] even if it has a 5% error it is better
[78.60 - 84.27] than having no data at all because as a
[81.93 - 86.10] coach if you come to know that muscle is
[84.27 - 88.20] dropping every tournament or every
[86.10 - 93.72] training after 3 months what should you
[88.20 - 96.33] do you should see go to the nutritionist
[93.72 - 98.79] go to the physiotherapist go to whoever
[96.33 - 101.93] you have to go to because something we
[98.79 - 104.61] are doing and you're losing muscle
[101.93 - 105.66] second thing don't check muscle check
[104.61 - 108.03] fat percentage
[105.66 - 110.67] these weighing scales are so modern now
[108.03 - 111.99] you step on them even your a your weight
[110.67 - 113.34] and my weight it will take so if you
[111.99 - 115.20] don't want to buy for children buy one
[113.34 - 118.86] for yourself at least your health will
[115.20 - 123.63] be good ok so fat percentage in Indian
[118.86 - 125.52] gene deposits around the stomach so in
[123.63 - 127.83] this part of the world we have heavy
[125.52 - 129.33] deposition on the midriff I am NOT
[127.83 - 132.91] talking about all people so today by
[129.33 - 134.86] Jamie small children 8 to 16 year olds
[132.91 - 136.87] have sixteen year olds coming tall 6
[134.86 - 139.30] feet very good but when they stand at
[136.87 - 142.78] the weighing scale visceral fat visceral
[139.30 - 144.67] fat is a fat near the organs 5 6 I have
[142.78 - 148.69] a German player John placed and the net
[144.67 - 151.18] zero because the genetics is different
[148.69 - 154.81] the diet is different so keep that in
[151.18 - 158.83] mind okay water the weighing scales now
[154.81 - 161.44] measure percentage of water 60% is a
[158.83 - 163.81] normal level I recently had a 12 year
[161.44 - 166.75] old girl when she stepped on the scale
[163.81 - 169.84] it came error I was like huh took it out
[166.75 - 172.72] change the battery sister up arrow took
[169.84 - 174.64] it out not working so fortunately I have
[172.72 - 175.99] three for counseling rooms I went and
[174.64 - 180.04] got the other weighing scale and put it
[175.99 - 183.07] so error so now I was like you know one
[180.04 - 185.41] thing just hydrate well so what did you
[183.07 - 187.69] do she said yesterday I played singles
[185.41 - 189.52] and doubles blah blah blah it was four
[187.69 - 191.41] hours of playing and everything so she
[189.52 - 194.77] came back the next day and she stood on
[191.41 - 197.26] it and it said 55% water that means the
[194.77 - 198.70] previous day the scale was not able to
[197.26 - 200.53] read and I don't know for what reason I
[198.70 - 202.66] don't have an answer but it gave me a
[200.53 - 206.49] thought process when players are playing
[202.66 - 209.44] matches back-to-back Monday to Thursday
[206.49 - 212.23] why they losing in semifinals and finals
[209.44 - 214.30] because they are dehydrated internally
[212.23 - 217.50] the cell has become like a there's a
[214.30 - 222.28] gray pot I know what is grape in Hindi
[217.50 - 225.10] ungood are draped grape job Tsukasa hoja
