[0.08 - 4.72] hey guys if you're not able to watch my
[2.28 - 7.04] long form content of podcast here are
[4.72 - 10.20] some short form clips for you to enjoy
[7.04 - 13.92] North India South India this is huge
[10.20 - 15.64] dietary difference uh height difference
[13.92 - 19.16] body type difference pollution
[15.64 - 22.28] difference um are there any data coming
[19.16 - 24.32] up to you guys that says that people
[22.28 - 25.84] from South India should uh run faster
[24.32 - 27.52] for a testing people from North India
[25.84 - 30.36] should run faster with give us some
[27.52 - 32.56] insights so there was a recent report um
[30.36 - 36.24] I read uh which was conducted across
[32.56 - 38.88] several States in in India uh you know
[36.24 - 41.36] if I look at diabetes for
[38.88 - 43.92] example South and North are actually
[41.36 - 45.84] equally predisposed although Central and
[43.92 - 48.04] Northeastern parts of the country have
[45.84 - 49.92] less incidence of diabetes it's also an
[48.04 - 51.92] urban phenomena so right Urban
[49.92 - 54.84] population has more diabetes incidents
[51.92 - 57.72] than rural population but interestingly
[54.84 - 59.20] pre-diabetes is actually the the number
[57.72 - 60.80] is much higher than the diabetic
[59.20 - 63.44] population which is a very dangerous
[60.80 - 65.28] thing doctor for the uninitiated out
[63.44 - 68.80] there right everyone says diabetes
[65.28 - 71.60] diabetes diabetes can you in a layman
[68.80 - 74.20] term explain what is diabetes and then
[71.60 - 78.64] what is pre-diabetes yeah so diabetes is
[74.20 - 81.32] a condition where the body's ability to
[78.64 - 84.12] produce insulin is compromised insulin
[81.32 - 86.60] is produced from uh pancreas and when
[84.12 - 88.48] there are cells in pancreas that become
[86.60 - 91.28] nonfunctional the insulin quantity
[88.48 - 93.60] reduces and are body's ability to
[91.28 - 96.44] process glucose diminishes and hence you
[93.60 - 98.48] have high blood sugar and whence that
[96.44 - 100.64] blood sugar touches a certain threshold
[98.48 - 102.92] or remains Beyond a threshold
[100.64 - 104.64] consistently that's when we call you
[102.92 - 106.68] know it a diabetic condition I think
[104.64 - 108.80] South India overall has a slightly
[106.68 - 110.68] marginally higher risk for ncds overall
[108.80 - 113.32] so everyone if you're out here in South
[110.68 - 114.60] India let's all get tested pre-diabetic
[113.32 - 116.36] because we eating too much of
[114.60 - 117.88] carbohydrates or rice and our sugar
[116.36 - 120.64] levels have gone up diabetes and
[117.88 - 122.32] hypertension are I would say un equ
[120.64 - 124.44] distributed only the central part of
[122.32 - 126.52] India and northeastern part of India had
[124.44 - 129.36] less incidents of these two conditions
[126.52 - 131.08] among genders men have a higher
[129.36 - 133.76] predisposition for you know high
[131.08 - 135.68] cholesterol level than women uh so that
[133.76 - 138.48] was the other finding but in all of this
[135.68 - 140.92] I would say the biggest alarming finding
[138.48 - 143.52] has been the rising incidence of
[140.92 - 146.60] pre-diabetes across urban and rural
[143.52 - 148.80] areas so that you know I think today for
[146.60 - 150.32] example we have 98 million diabetics in
[148.80 - 152.96] the country we the diabetic Capital
[150.32 - 155.16] which 17% of all overall diabetics
[152.96 - 157.20] globally and I think we love our food
[155.16 - 158.84] and we love our sweets and also that the
[157.20 - 161.76] fact that we have this propensity
[158.84 - 164.16] exactly propensity as a population you
[161.76 - 165.88] made something very keen because my
[164.16 - 168.28] father-in-law is an orthopedic surgeon
[165.88 - 171.20] he's 78 years old and he loves he's from
[168.28 - 173.68] orisa and he loves his mishti DOI and
[171.20 - 177.48] rusas and all and he eats more sugar
[173.68 - 180.16] than I do right and he has an hp1c score
[177.48 - 182.24] of 5.2 so you mentioned some something
[180.16 - 184.56] from that part of India people have a
[182.24 - 186.28] diabetic resistant gene or something I
[184.56 - 188.44] mean they have less propensity L
[186.28 - 189.96] propensity for diabetic I'm just
[188.44 - 191.96] thinking I'm sure he's quite active
[189.96 - 194.00] isn't he yeah he's very active but I'm
[191.96 - 197.00] just thinking if we could just get that
[194.00 - 200.44] Gene you know and uh like eat our rascas
[197.00 - 204.04] more often but jokes apart jok's apart I
[200.44 - 206.40] think as a nutritionist people are
[204.04 - 208.28] eating far more than their fathers and
[206.40 - 210.68] mothers and their grandfathers and
[208.28 - 212.24] grandmothers we just did a food diary
[210.68 - 214.16] with few of our clients I I had the
[212.24 - 216.68] privilege of working with a family of
[214.16 - 218.44] three generations so I would ask the
[216.68 - 220.84] grandfather and grandmother how many
[218.44 - 223.88] times you ate out so they met out once a
[220.84 - 224.96] quarter at MTR and ate once a quarter
[223.88 - 227.36] because they didn't have that much of
[224.96 - 230.40] money right the father and mother met
[227.36 - 234.12] out once a month you didn't have that
[230.40 - 236.96] much money true the children are in MTR
[234.12 - 240.28] every third day right so so the
[236.96 - 242.04] incidences of external Expos and
[240.28 - 243.88] therefore when you go out no portion
[242.04 - 246.52] control you eat how much you want
[243.88 - 248.48] absolutely and with the new thing which
[246.52 - 250.68] I feel is that people are just eating
[248.48 - 253.60] more because they're stressed out like
[250.68 - 256.80] we work very hard and that's what that
[253.60 - 259.44] Grandfather said we did a 9 to5 job
[256.80 - 261.04] there was no SMS WhatsApp or or Zoom
[259.44 - 263.64] call at 7:00 in the evening which your
[261.04 - 266.52] boss gone to you so you stopped your day
[263.64 - 268.52] but your Generations are working double
[266.52 - 270.68] hard which means the brain is working so
[268.52 - 274.24] much so when you finish your day your
[270.68 - 276.40] life need a reward yeah yeah yeah or
[274.24 - 277.92] you're not as conscious about it also
[276.40 - 279.52] because you're so distracted with so
[277.92 - 281.64] many things that are going on I never
[279.52 - 283.84] thought about that right being
[281.64 - 287.28] distracted yeah and therefore you end up
[283.84 - 290.68] just uh consuming whatever how much ever
[287.28 - 293.04] without really being mindful about
[290.68 - 296.24] what's going on and since a lot of your
[293.04 - 298.12] followers like nutrition allow me to
[296.24 - 301.64] actually talk about my three rules
[298.12 - 304.20] around consumption the first is reduce
[301.64 - 307.08] reduce right um let's stop eating when
[304.20 - 311.16] we are 80% full Ah that's a nice thought
[307.08 - 313.92] yeah and so reduce the second is
[311.16 - 315.36] reorder proteins and vegetables and
[313.92 - 317.76] fruits
[315.36 - 320.04] first and then carbohydrates Oh I
[317.76 - 322.72] thought you meant reorder an aater get
[320.04 - 325.72] me another order I was like this doctor
[322.72 - 327.76] is really cool okay reorder means change
[325.72 - 329.20] the order in which you are consuming
[327.76 - 331.20] consuming yeah that's right so say that
[329.20 - 332.64] again protein first and veget protein
[331.20 - 335.16] and fruits and vegetables vegetables
[332.64 - 337.04] first first then carbohydrates so for
[335.16 - 339.16] example in our home the proteins come
[337.04 - 341.32] out to the table first get served first
[339.16 - 344.04] salads fruits and vegetables even if in
[341.32 - 346.12] a cooked form get served first so while
[344.04 - 347.88] it's first on your table even if you're
[346.12 - 350.20] mindless about it you're that's what
[347.88 - 353.04] you're consuming first and you get a
[350.20 - 355.68] little bit full and then come the carbs
[353.04 - 359.04] onto your plate right and so
[355.68 - 361.52] reorder and the third is replace where
[359.04 - 363.92] you can find a way to replace the
[361.52 - 365.96] processed foods that we are used to
[363.92 - 368.48] these days with a little bit more
[365.96 - 371.76] traditional foods like some of your
[368.48 - 374.36] millets or uh brown rice brown sugar
[371.76 - 377.36] jagu and so forth in reduced quantities
[374.36 - 380.48] right so allows us to then replace some
[377.36 - 382.88] of the ingredients in what we cook for
[380.48 - 386.40] an overall balanced meal but it's still
[382.88 - 387.92] the kind of food that we eat every day
[386.40 - 390.00] at home without putting pressure on the
[387.92 - 391.36] kitchen yeah sorry I just wanted to add
[390.00 - 393.28] I mean you know and you would probably I
[391.36 - 395.40] mean you're the expert this that Dean
[393.28 - 397.48] Nash's diet what have I got the name did
[395.40 - 399.56] I get the name orish Dean orish diet
[397.48 - 402.12] right that actually changing your
[399.56 - 403.56] dietary habits can reverse aging and
[402.12 - 405.96] reverse many of these conditions isn't
[403.56 - 407.60] that right so as as a celebrity
[405.96 - 410.92] nutrition test I make a lot of money
[407.60 - 413.48] doing that exactly exactly job so I
[410.92 - 416.04] meant it's just not the I mean screening
[413.48 - 417.52] is big part of it but I think diet and
[416.04 - 418.84] change in modification right I think
[417.52 - 421.44] going forward is going to be play a big
[418.84 - 424.36] role if can speak very candidly from a
[421.44 - 427.44] nutritionist or a doctor the screening
[424.36 - 429.76] gives you the wakeup call yes to wake up
[427.44 - 433.08] and smell the roses that you have only
[429.76 - 435.04] one body absolutely and this body cannot
[433.08 - 437.76] be replaced like your mobile phone
[435.04 - 439.44] laptop house and even spouse in fact one
[437.76 - 441.52] day I had an argument with my wife I
[439.44 - 443.08] said my body is my life partner she say
[441.52 - 445.64] what do you mean to say I'm your life
[443.08 - 447.32] partner I'm like look dude I had to get
[445.64 - 449.92] out of bed to get married to you the
[447.32 - 451.68] body went it got married to you you
[449.92 - 454.08] trust me very true our body should be
[451.68 - 456.76] our first love yes and so I told her
[454.08 - 459.20] this my wife is not hearing this yeah
[456.76 - 461.72] you like me like me I slept in the next
[459.20 - 465.00] bedroom for the next one week but but at
[461.72 - 467.84] the end of the day um you know when we
[465.00 - 471.56] do these screenings I have
[467.84 - 474.28] seen an instant disciplinary
[471.56 - 476.28] modification by my client the reason
[474.28 - 479.68] being is I'll give you an example oh
[476.28 - 481.40] Dean Onish told me to eat this diet plan
[479.68 - 486.12] Ryan Fernando told me to e this that
[481.40 - 488.48] plan but if your AI heart screening says
[486.12 - 490.76] you are predisposition to diabetes or
[488.48 - 492.44] heart attack in so many days then the
[490.76 - 495.16] person sitting down in the counseling
[492.44 - 497.56] room and saying what do I need to change
[495.16 - 499.68] yes it's the trigger for change the
[497.56 - 501.44] behavioral modification for change and I
[499.68 - 503.24] think over a period of time if genetic
[501.44 - 505.52] screening were to become cheaper and
[503.24 - 507.08] mandatory in some form or shape that
[505.52 - 508.84] would actually lead to you know
[507.08 - 511.56] Revolution so to speak hey guys if
