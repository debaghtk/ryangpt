vitamin D synthesis yes cholesterol sunlight converts cholesterol in the skin into vitamin D and is crucial for bone health and immune function so why do cholesterol levels actually exceed your Healthy limits there can be several factors then cause the cholesterol levels to rise above your normal healthy limits one of them is your diet consuming too many saturated fats trans fats and cholesterol rich foods can increase LDL the bad cholesterol now all the oily Foods deep fried foods and street foods are one of the main causes of higher LDL levels we have everything at the push of a

cholesterol which is the good cholesterol and increase the LDL the bad cholesterol another reason could be smoking and alcohol do you know that smoking lowers HDL cholesterol and excessive alcohol consumption can also lead to higher total cholesterol levels now there's a new study that came out from The kolinska Institute in Sweden and this revealed that immune cells in the liver react to high cholesterol levels and eat up the excess cholesterol that can otherwise cause damage to your arteries so imagine your immune system is actually helping your liver to combat high cholesterol now these findings were published in the Nature's cardiovascular research journal and suggest that the response to the onset of arthrosclerosis begins in the liver so bad cholesterol or LDL is a type of fat that is essential for many functions in the body such as making hormones and cell membranes however too much of cholesterol in the blood can be harmful as this cholesterol can stick to the walls of the artery and form blocks that kind of narrow out or block the blood flow this results in arthrosclerotic cardiovascular disease blockage of your pipelines the primary underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes and the leading cause of death worldwide so let me summarize this you have cholesterol which is produced by your own liver now the cholesterol are a good guy and the bad guy you want more of the good guy but your lifestyle your diet your smoking or inactivity is causing the bad cholesterol to go up and the good cholesterol to come down now the liver is supposed to take care of this but what if there's excess dumping of cholesterol into your body via the diet now this cholesterol could get attacked by your sugar or the free radicals or the stress in your body and this cholesterol becomes sticky and it starts depositing on the sides of your artery walls making them thicker but the inside pipeline of the artery gets clogged out or narrowed this happens the heart heart attack happens in the brain stroke happens in your legs lowered blood circulation to the toes and feet so what I'm trying to communicate to you is any future lifestyle disease where one of the leading causes of mortality comes from stroke and heart attack and blood pressure are all related to this innocent molecule called cholesterol let's not vilify cholesterol the problem is not
