Transcript: did you know that it can take up to 13 years for some women to get correctly diagnosed with PCOS over 50% of women with PCOS report that it negatively affects their work with some even missing work due to symptoms in India the number of PCOS cases is on the rise so I had to make this video this video will explain everything about this condition let's get started now pcus is a hormonal disorder that affects up to 10% of the women of reproductive age between 1990 and 2019 the incident of pcus increased globally by 54% with the highest rates among teenagers age 15 to 19 this condition involves irregular menstrual cycles excess Androgen levels and polycystic ovaries leading to symptoms like acne hair loss difficulty with weight management it can also increase the risk of of serious health issues like diabetes heart disease infertility and even depression pcus is one of the leading causes of infertility and is responsible for 70% of the cases of anov infertility there are several common misconceptions about pcus first it's not just a reproductive disorder it's a complex endocrine disorder that can also impact metabolic and psychological health for example 37% of women with PCS experience depression compared to 14.2% of those without PCS another myth is that all women with PCS are overweight while weight gain is common due to insulin resistance and hormonal imbalance lean women can also have PCS some believe that PCS goes away after menopause although some symptoms like irregular periods May naturally resolve that underlining metabolic and hormonal imbalances can still persist and no birth control pills do not cure pcus they help regulate the menstrual cycles and reduce Androgen levels but the underlying hormonal imbalance actually remains lifestyle changes and other treatments are often needed to manage the condition comprehensively women with PCS face several challenges diagnostic delays are common with an average delay of over 4 years up to 52% women report receiving insufficient information from their Healthcare Providers and about 70% feel dismissed or not listened to by their doctors many General Practitioners lack the necessary training to diagnose and manage pcus effectively leading to dissatisfaction among patients now listen in closely apart from the usual symptoms of PCS such as irregular menstrual cycles excess Androgen levels polycystic ovaries insulin resistance weight gain acne thinning of hair on the scalp there are other symptoms that you might not be aware of and these are darkening of the skin particularly in the areas like the neck groin or underarms watch for this the other symptom could be pelvic pains which can be irregular or less directly related to the menstrual cycle headaches or migraines linked to hormonal imbalances they're quite common sleep apnea or snoring and this disturbs your sleep especially in the women who are overweight or have insulin resistance dry or flaky skin due to hormonal changes is huge digestive issues like bloating or irregular ball movements potentially related to insulin resistance or other metabolic changes is often seen now traditional medicine often focuses on managing the symptoms of PCS through medication or surgical interventions however holistic aspects are sometimes overlooked I would like to mention some points I think that we all know about them but we do not practice them thoroughly first one stress management techniques like mindfulness yoga meditation and relaxation exercises can really help you manage your stress and improve your overall well-being actionable steps will be waking up a little early starting with 30 minutes and with time build consistency which will help you in your breath work yoga meditation or any exercise which can be scaled up to 1 hour by the way if you don't know where to start I've pasted a link to my favorite guided breath work videos the link is in the description below tune in and kick to your day but to rise early you need to sleep well which brings me to my second Point Sleep Quality post sleep can negatively impact hormonal balance and insulin sensitivity ensuring good sleep hygiene and addressing any sleep orders that can support overall health and symptom management so what do I do go easy on your dinner and finish it off 3 hours prior after that don't use too much of a screen with blue light TV go easy wind down read a book some calming music warm lights mild hot showers read a nice fictional book this will help you sleep or get sleepy faster you know what even herbal and complimentary therapies may work some herbal supplements and complimentary therapies like spearmint te for reducing excess hair growth or even acupuncture for hormonal balance may often additional support gut health the health of the gut microbiome can influence inflammation and hormonal balance so eat foods that support your gut health what works for me doesn't work for you so your gut needs a personalized diet now I practiced at the qua nutrition clinics where we do needful tests like microbiome testing food intolerance testing genetic testing and even the normal blood test before we plan the diet so to get yours there's a link to a Google form in my description below please fill it out and my team can get back to with the earliest now PCOS can be presented in different phenotypes including hyperandrogenic ovulatory nonovulatory and Mild understanding that not all individuals with PCS have the same symptoms helps in tailoring treatment and avoiding a one-size fits-all approach in conclusion PCOS is not just a reproductive disorder but also influences your metabolic and psychological Health women with PC us are at a risk of being diagnosed very late or misdiagnosed due to a knowledge Gap among practitioners besides the usual symptoms PCOS can also lead to skin darkening pelvic pains and problems like sleep apnea therefore I believe managing diet and exercising are the most common methods of managing PCS but methods such as Mental Health Management sleep hygiene maintenance and herbal therapies are often overlooked PCOS can manifest in different ways in different people so it's important to get a full body checkup once in a while to help in early diagnosis and the management of the disease so if you're someone who has been diagnosed with PCS
