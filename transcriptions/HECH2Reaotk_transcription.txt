[61.84 - 70.15] [Music]
[73.04 - 76.44] how you finding India this time around
[74.92 - 78.20] super wonderful always good to be in
[76.44 - 80.24] India always good to pleasure to car
[78.20 - 81.80] with you I was just so excited when I
[80.24 - 84.00] realized that Christmas time that you
[81.80 - 87.12] coming into India so I was like I told
[84.00 - 90.56] my team let's meet Dr Paul because you
[87.12 - 93.84] know what here's a gastro doctor
[90.56 - 96.44] surgeon who tells people fast and eat
[93.84 - 99.36] less so my kind of
[96.44 - 101.80] guy so it's going to be like funny for
[99.36 - 104.28] me to ask you questions and our
[101.80 - 107.44] followers confuse us for each other
[104.28 - 109.56] anyways anyways so I said let's open it
[107.44 - 111.24] up to them super and what are the
[109.56 - 114.24] questions that your followers or my
[111.24 - 116.08] followers had from the gastro which is
[114.24 - 118.56] the gut Department correct so a quick
[116.08 - 120.68] fire of about 15 20 Questions doctor's
[118.56 - 122.88] really busy is giving in is surgery time
[120.68 - 125.32] to us so we really get cracking okay so
[122.88 - 127.64] first question somebody asked me I
[125.32 - 129.24] always face constipation and bloating
[127.64 - 131.52] though I'm a vegetarian so the
[129.24 - 132.28] assumption is vegetarians are holier
[131.52 - 134.00] than
[132.28 - 137.48] thou
[134.00 - 140.12] and I always face constipation and
[137.48 - 141.80] bloating though I'm a vegetarian meaning
[140.12 - 144.12] what vegetarian is Untouchable in the
[141.80 - 147.16] gut system and I eat out once in a while
[144.12 - 150.00] so first things Dr Paul constipation
[147.16 - 152.84] what is it and bloating what is it and
[150.00 - 155.84] vegetarians also get her T part
[152.84 - 157.88] okay so uh the most common cause of
[155.84 - 160.00] constipation is lack of fiber intake
[157.88 - 161.44] okay okay and also lack of water intake
[160.00 - 162.80] usually what we tell my patients
[161.44 - 164.36] whenever the patients coming in
[162.80 - 166.04] constipation is the first thing is
[164.36 - 168.08] increase your water intake to minimum 2
[166.04 - 171.52] L of water per day and then increase
[168.08 - 173.32] your fiber big time at least 25 G of
[171.52 - 175.88] fiber per day and that's a lot until you
[173.32 - 178.88] consciously include it you are not going
[175.88 - 181.60] to get it uh based on the current uh
[178.88 - 184.60] eating habits and then the most common
[181.60 - 186.72] cause of bloating is constipation
[184.60 - 189.28] because the poop is held back in the gut
[186.72 - 191.16] usually you know uh there disregulation
[189.28 - 193.20] of the brain gut axis and there's a
[191.16 - 195.08] development of bad gut bacteria in we
[193.20 - 196.80] call this as sometimes chronic
[195.08 - 197.96] idiopathic constipation or irritable
[196.80 - 200.92] bubble syndrome of constipation but
[197.96 - 203.16] regardless there is this disbiosis where
[200.92 - 204.92] there is brain C axis is disregulated I
[203.16 - 207.56] know talking medical
[204.92 - 208.92] options speaking of medical options was
[207.56 - 210.60] there ever a case where you just told a
[208.92 - 213.20] person drink more water and it cured
[210.60 - 215.12] them to be honest that is the treatment
[213.20 - 216.76] but people think that I need to give the
[215.12 - 218.32] medications only then they will be
[216.76 - 221.44] reassured okay good this is a good
[218.32 - 223.88] doctor and obviously you know we
[221.44 - 226.68] recommend people to drink water as a
[223.88 - 230.48] doctor how do you prescribe
[226.68 - 232.08] water uh is there a magical uh way that
[230.48 - 235.24] you do it or anything like that yeah yes
[232.08 - 237.84] I do I do so you know even my
[235.24 - 239.96] personality and also my education is
[237.84 - 242.76] usually not theoretical so I always do
[239.96 - 245.68] practical uh ways to trips and my
[242.76 - 247.96] patient so we calculate eight glasses of
[245.68 - 250.88] water per day so I tell them to drink
[247.96 - 253.48] one glass before meals and one glass
[250.88 - 256.64] after meal breakfast lunch dinner six
[253.48 - 258.64] glasses and then one glass 10:00 a.m.
[256.64 - 260.56] morning snack and then P p.m. snack
[258.64 - 263.88] you're all done awesome
[260.56 - 267.56] advice staying with the same thing one
[263.88 - 270.64] of our followers asked us can
[267.56 - 275.04] dehydration lack of water cause stomach
[270.64 - 276.60] cramps oh yes you know uh so see in my
[275.04 - 279.24] channel as well always have been
[276.60 - 281.28] promoting hormonal balance correct
[279.24 - 283.12] circadian rhythm and there are only like
[281.28 - 284.80] few major important hormones that we
[283.12 - 287.52] need to be really considerate one is the
[284.80 - 289.44] you know insulin melatonin cortisol um
[287.52 - 290.64] three major hormon that I absolutely
[289.44 - 292.60] worship and love and everybody should
[290.64 - 294.56] love and worship as well so these
[292.60 - 297.36] hormones love
[294.56 - 300.16] water ah so you know when you give water
[297.36 - 301.72] they just like they're having a party
[300.16 - 304.60] out there they're not grumpy ah they're
[301.72 - 307.20] basically swimming in the pool um so
[304.60 - 309.72] basically you increase the quality of
[307.20 - 312.84] these hormones by providing them water
[309.72 - 314.52] for the uninitiated to stomach cramp
[312.84 - 317.28] what would be the easiest way we could
[314.52 - 319.32] describe what is stomach cramping uh
[317.28 - 321.72] stomach because females say like I got
[319.32 - 323.88] cramps right and then here somebody's
[321.72 - 327.00] talking about a gut cramp correct and
[323.88 - 329.72] then verat kohi gets a calf cramp so as
[327.00 - 332.12] a doctor can you kind of give us like a
[329.72 - 334.20] man opinion of is it a knife poking us
[332.12 - 336.12] or somebody socking you in the gut what
[334.20 - 338.32] is it like so cramps itself is a
[336.12 - 340.32] muscular contraction correct where it
[338.32 - 341.84] happens in cal It's skeletal muscle
[340.32 - 343.52] contraction when it happens in the gut
[341.84 - 346.24] it's smooth muscle contraction oh we
[343.52 - 347.20] have muscles in the gut gut is nothing
[346.24 - 349.68] but
[347.20 - 352.36] muscle as well so could I train that
[349.68 - 353.84] like a gym training uh like you know how
[352.36 - 356.08] I go to the gym and train my bicep could
[353.84 - 358.28] I train my stomach muscles also by
[356.08 - 360.64] eating good food which and P fiber that
[358.28 - 362.20] is the exercise of the stomach oh so
[360.64 - 365.08] that's the exercise of stomach eat
[362.20 - 366.92] correctly eat correctly and not do this
[365.08 - 370.32] in the
[366.92 - 373.52] kitchen so no stomach crunches as doctor
[370.32 - 375.48] says U and speaking further we're going
[373.52 - 378.80] to talk only about B our followers one
[375.48 - 381.92] somebody asked us is syum husk or what
[378.80 - 385.00] we call in India as isab Gul good for
[381.92 - 387.16] gut bacteria can I consume it every day
[385.00 - 390.20] so selum mask is a wonderful option we
[387.16 - 391.88] also um give it to all my patients in uh
[390.20 - 395.52] us as well it comes with a brand called
[391.88 - 397.20] matam musil um the idea behind that is
[395.52 - 399.44] as we talked about fiber is absolutely
[397.20 - 401.24] critical for the gut uh in our modern
[399.44 - 403.12] days era we don't get enough fiber so we
[401.24 - 405.20] add this fiber supplements but the
[403.12 - 407.40] problem is we need to add it very slowly
[405.20 - 409.20] because every individual is different so
[407.40 - 411.68] sometimes fiber can precipitate
[409.20 - 413.28] abdominal bloating so most of the times
[411.68 - 415.28] what happens is I take as them to take
[413.28 - 416.60]  mask they take one day and then they
[415.28 - 417.68] get bloated and they like you know this
[416.60 - 420.56] doctor is not good let's go to a
[417.68 - 422.64] different doctor oh so you should talk
[420.56 - 424.36] very very slowly sometimes you might be
[422.64 - 425.88] able to even take two to three capsules
[424.36 - 428.16] that you'll be surprised sometimes
[425.88 - 430.72] you'll be able to eat only one or even
[428.16 - 432.64] better is forget about celum Basque and
[430.72 - 434.52] just take fiber through natural sources
[432.64 - 437.52] until you reach 25 G of fiber per day
[434.52 - 439.28] minimum so 25 G of fiber is the key
[437.52 - 441.52] thing try and find it from natural
[439.28 - 443.96] sources I think the human race wants
[441.52 - 445.60] more convenience of a powder or pill and
[443.96 - 447.68] they're not willing to go back and check
[445.60 - 450.28] what are the foods which have fiber and
[447.68 - 451.72] how can I take that at my daily correct
[450.28 - 453.84] but uh but you know it's a long process
[451.72 - 455.84] even I myself didn't know what was the
[453.84 - 459.12] fiber content in multiple food
[455.84 - 461.12] ingredients so educating Yourself by
[459.12 - 463.40] seeing Ryan's
[461.12 - 466.16] channel in terms of how much fiber is
[463.40 - 468.04] there in every ingredient uh slowly and
[466.16 - 469.32] steadily what happens is that even
[468.04 - 471.32] without your knowledge you will start
[469.32 - 473.80] incorporating all these ingredients so
[471.32 - 475.88] you do a lot of colonoscopies and
[473.80 - 478.48] endoscopy so you put a camera in and you
[475.88 - 482.24] check people's guts both from top down
[478.48 - 485.20] and bottom up up correct when people eat
[482.24 - 487.88] really good or have good fiber are you
[485.20 - 491.32] as a doctor able to see a good gut and a
[487.88 - 493.84] bad gut absolutely yes so when we put a
[491.32 - 495.92] camera down we can see how inflamed how
[493.84 - 497.68] angry the stomach is you can see that
[495.92 - 500.16] yeah absolutely when we put a camera
[497.68 - 502.92] down so that means people because they
[500.16 - 505.40] can't see something they're not able to
[502.92 - 507.76] link that they are slapping their gut
[505.40 - 510.12] correct but they slapping it inside ah
[507.76 - 512.84] so that's the dangerous part so it's too
[510.12 - 514.80] late sometimes before they come to you
[512.84 - 517.52] and not too late uh I mean to a point
[514.80 - 518.84] that yes regarding terms of symptoms yes
[517.52 - 521.04] you know it's too late that what are the
[518.84 - 523.04] symptoms we should look for like what
[521.04 - 525.60] are the symptoms I should look at or our
[523.04 - 526.88] follower should look for so that we
[525.60 - 529.20] don't have to put a camera down our
[526.88 - 532.32] throat or up a
[529.20 - 533.88] butt so uh there are two parts to that
[532.32 - 536.12] okay so the up your butt is
[533.88 - 538.48] colonoscopies yes and I do that when
[536.12 - 540.76] patients don't have any symptoms at all
[538.48 - 542.56] ah okay expand please doctor so it's a
[540.76 - 545.00] screening procedure why should we do
[542.56 - 549.40] screening so in United States when you
[545.00 - 552.32] turn 50 the medical insurance pays me to
[549.40 - 553.64] do the colonoscopies on every patient
[552.32 - 556.28] and what are we looking for we're
[553.64 - 558.44] looking for growths inside the colon we
[556.28 - 559.84] call it as colon polyps what are these
[558.44 - 561.68] polyps these are like similar to skin
[559.84 - 564.24] growths it can grow inside the colon
[561.68 - 566.28] based on your genetic predisposition
[564.24 - 568.20] what you are eating lack of fiber lack
[566.28 - 570.80] of physical activity obesity all these
[568.20 - 573.40] are risk factors for formation of these
[570.80 - 575.12] precancerous colon polyps and these
[573.40 - 577.96] screenings that you do doctor on these
[575.12 - 580.56] 50 plus people have you found people who
[577.96 - 582.72] you have saved their lives absolutely I
[580.56 - 586.52] mean this is my date I'm a superhero on
[582.72 - 588.04] a daily basis wow wow wow so sticking
[586.52 - 589.80] with the gut and I'm going to come back
[588.04 - 592.56] to this colonoscopy and
[589.80 - 595.40] endoscopy uh I think in a lot we got
[592.56 - 598.16] like about 25 or 30% of people asking
[595.40 - 600.84] this one question which is Doctor what
[598.16 - 602.72] are the remedies for acid reflux so my
[600.84 - 604.84] first question to you what is acid
[602.72 - 607.68] reflux and then who are the guys who are
[604.84 - 610.12] going to save us okay acid reflex is
[607.68 - 612.48] basically reflex of the stomach acid
[610.12 - 614.48] back into the esophagus reflex means
[612.48 - 616.44] what it comes back H regurgitation
[614.48 - 619.76] basically it comes back basically the
[616.44 - 622.00] acid should be in the stomach alone but
[619.76 - 624.32] unfortunately something has happened
[622.00 - 625.92] where the spinter muscle there is a
[624.32 - 628.56] muscle at the end of the junction of the
[625.92 - 631.08] foot pipe and the stomach it is supposed
[628.56 - 632.76] to close it's like a gate it's a gate
[631.08 - 634.64] it's a door so if that doesn't close
[632.76 - 637.56] properly the acid comes back so when you
[634.64 - 640.36] eat food goes inside the stomach the
[637.56 - 642.08] acid is secreted by the stomach and it
[640.36 - 644.32] gets broken down into small pieces
[642.08 - 646.84] correct and then the lots of acid is
[644.32 - 650.28] being secreted because we heat it not so
[646.84 - 652.24] what happens is if this if this door the
[650.28 - 654.20] door closes as soon as the stomach the
[652.24 - 657.28] foot goes into the stomach but if the
[654.20 - 660.92] door is open because acid is secreted
[657.28 - 662.44] acid comes back into this sagus awesome
[660.92 - 665.92] there's a funny question we got from one
[662.44 - 668.96] of our followers okay my stomach
[665.92 - 671.20] speaking like in third person my stomach
[668.96 - 672.72] not me my stomach is not digesting gee
[671.20 - 676.32] or fried
[672.72 - 679.80] foods if I eat those Foods I pass tools
[676.32 - 682.52] with mucus and I get lose motions what
[679.80 - 684.40] should we answer to such a follower so
[682.52 - 686.52] um maybe he's very sensitive to those
[684.40 - 688.24] foots correct but isn't it common sense
[686.52 - 691.20] you eat eat something it's going to slap
[688.24 - 693.76] you you should avoid it uh so there are
[691.20 - 696.40] two parts to it one is if you eat more
[693.76 - 698.92] yes that is the so you mean to say that
[696.40 - 701.32] sometimes we can fly under the radar by
[698.92 - 703.84] eating lesser of that correct correct
[701.32 - 705.40] exactly so first thing to this person is
[703.84 - 707.08] that you need to decrease the fried
[705.40 - 709.52] fatty foods whenever whatever he is
[707.08 - 711.72] eating but let's say that he still has
[709.52 - 713.36] the problem even after decreasing it
[711.72 - 716.12] that is where we say that your stomach
[713.36 - 718.48] is very sensitive we need to fine tune
[716.12 - 721.28] your stomach handhold your stomach and
[718.48 - 723.68] love your stomach com back for those who
[721.28 - 726.44] are uninitiated but follow you and
[723.68 - 730.00] follow me what is the meaning of mucus
[726.44 - 732.76] in stoes so mucus is the intestinal
[730.00 - 734.68] lining secretes some fluid it's like a
[732.76 - 736.20] sticky when you blow your nose that does
[734.68 - 738.48] it look like that mucus when you blow
[736.20 - 739.80] your nose is it a clear white mucus or
[738.48 - 742.64] is it like when you get a cold which is
[739.80 - 743.96] green mucus so it's usually ELO mucus
[742.64 - 746.24] and then you know we see that while we
[743.96 - 749.40] are doing the procedure colonoscopy so
[746.24 - 751.52] if I poty and I look down I should
[749.40 - 753.20] technically not see mucus with my stool
[751.52 - 755.12] and generally not yes generally not and
[753.20 - 757.88] if I see a lot of mucus it could be a
[755.12 - 759.72] sign of an problem it could be a simple
[757.88 - 762.08] problem like you know irritable bubble
[759.72 - 766.60] syndrome or something like that or it
[762.08 - 768.16] could be a uh relatively more uh um you
[766.60 - 769.64] know complex problem like inflammatory
[768.16 - 771.68] bubble disease like rones disease or
[769.64 - 773.84] altic colitis when you were in Medical
[771.68 - 775.60] College were you given stool samples to
[773.84 - 778.28] look at and see what is mucus and what
[775.60 - 780.84] is without mucus and I absolutely loved
[778.28 - 780.84] it
[781.48 - 784.60] I got a gut feeling you want to really
[783.08 - 786.76] enjoy your profession for the rest of
[784.60 - 789.64] your life
[786.76 - 791.80] absolutely okay so the reason I'm asking
[789.64 - 793.32] these questions is because uh you know
[791.80 - 795.36] oh one one thing it's most more than
[793.32 - 797.16] mucus the most important thing is blood
[795.36 - 798.36] oh we shouldn't see blood right Whenever
[797.16 - 799.76] there is there are two types of blood
[798.36 - 801.44] right fresh blood and old blood or
[799.76 - 804.00] something like that can you tell us
[801.44 - 807.32] about that yeah so more than mucus blood
[804.00 - 809.80] and stool is considered as a red flag so
[807.32 - 812.64] fresh blood would look like red blood
[809.80 - 814.44] huh so blood tool is could be bright red
[812.64 - 816.64] yes what what is that problem like most
[814.44 - 820.12] likely it is hemorrhoids you got to
[816.64 - 823.48] understand that we can get skin problems
[820.12 - 824.40] inside our gastrointestinal system and
[823.48 - 826.56] it could
[824.40 - 827.60] bleed yeah yeah so what if I bleed in
[826.56 - 829.60] the
[827.60 - 832.52] stomach then the color of my stool
[829.60 - 834.04] changes to Black so if I look at black
[832.52 - 835.96] and and when we talking about black what
[834.04 - 838.28] is black like this black like my hair
[835.96 - 840.88] like the mic black no my I don't have
[838.28 - 844.04] hair but still if you have or this might
[840.88 - 845.84] black it turns that black very dark so
[844.04 - 847.44] normally stool is brown in color light
[845.84 - 849.72] brown dark brown the reason that it is
[847.44 - 852.64] black is if there is a bleeding in the
[849.72 - 855.00] stomach the acid digests the blood which
[852.64 - 857.52] is red in color that turns into black
[855.00 - 859.80] and Cals down the intestine so those of
[857.52 - 863.00] you who got a black tongue and black
[859.80 - 865.76] stool see Dr pal immediately no see a
[863.00 - 866.96] good doctor locally as well we don't
[865.76 - 869.52] need to wait for him to fly down to
[866.96 - 871.32] America but these are things that people
[869.52 - 874.32] actually never discuss at the dining
[871.32 - 875.92] table or in families like I would share
[874.32 - 879.44] something very intimate with you and the
[875.92 - 883.48] followers around 10 years ago I had
[879.44 - 885.52] hemorrhoids and uh it was one and um you
[883.48 - 887.16] know I took a lot of termeric supplement
[885.52 - 889.40] and lot of Omega and lot of protein
[887.16 - 891.08] powder no fiber and I guess I started
[889.40 - 894.36] getting blood in my
[891.08 - 895.88] stools so I kind of got it treated uh
[894.36 - 897.20] with the rubber band kind of thing and
[895.88 - 899.88] it the doctor explains it's a very
[897.20 - 901.68] harmless procedure and got it done very
[899.88 - 904.44] interesting is why am I telling everyone
[901.68 - 905.88] about this is when I went to my mom and
[904.44 - 907.76] I said I'm going in for a medical
[905.88 - 911.08] procedure which is very simple and I'd
[907.76 - 913.60] be out in 2 hours she said I also have
[911.08 - 917.04] hemorrhoids like okay uh your
[913.60 - 918.24] grandfather also had it and then I was
[917.04 - 920.28] like what about your brothers and
[918.24 - 922.64] sisters I never asked them so I picked
[920.28 - 925.88] up the phone and started calling all my
[922.64 - 927.96] uncle and aunties and Chacha and chachis
[925.88 - 929.96] and everything and guess what Dr pal
[927.96 - 932.68] everybody everybody had it andone was
[929.96 - 935.08] silent about it so is it true that
[932.68 - 937.64] people don't discuss their bowel M and
[935.08 - 940.20] gut problems and it's it's a very like a
[937.64 - 943.44] taboo topic yeah absolutely and that's
[940.20 - 944.48] why I combine humor into this very Tabo
[943.44 - 946.28] topic what's your biggest what's your
[944.48 - 948.20] biggest joke to to a patient on the
[946.28 - 950.80] table I said welcome to the office of
[948.20 - 955.00] gut and butt gut and
[950.80 - 955.00] butt almost like beis and butt
[955.68 - 960.60] head now we have a lot of people who
[958.72 - 962.60] followers who will be pooping every day
[960.60 - 965.04] and be eating every day and mostly they
[962.60 - 966.64] come to me because they eat wrong and
[965.04 - 969.12] there's one problem I can't solve in
[966.64 - 971.96] eating is when people live in pgs being
[969.12 - 973.76] guest and hostels and that's most of
[971.96 - 975.64] struggling India Today people who watch
[973.76 - 977.44] us who building their careers and all
[975.64 - 979.72] and they want to work late nights and
[977.44 - 981.84] all and they're saying that how do I
[979.72 - 984.56] control gastric if I stay in pgs and
[981.84 - 987.08] hotels because they add baking soda to
[984.56 - 989.12] food so you know there are some
[987.08 - 991.04] modifiable factors and there are some
[989.12 - 992.76] non-m modif like what what secret agent
[991.04 - 994.28] can we take to protect us that's what
[992.76 - 995.72] I'm saying so there's modifiable factors
[994.28 - 997.52] and then non-modifiable factors
[995.72 - 999.96] non-modifiable factors it looks like in
[997.52 - 1001.72] this person where they are giving baking
[999.96 - 1004.80] soda in the mess and he doesn't have any
[1001.72 - 1007.40] other option to modify that um best case
[1004.80 - 1009.52] scenario is stop it but as a medical
[1007.40 - 1011.60] doctor do you think baking soda does a
[1009.52 - 1013.16] KU or irritate your gun it completely
[1011.60 - 1015.80] depends upon the individual it's
[1013.16 - 1017.80] bioindividual it it also also it's like
[1015.80 - 1019.36] I I can't stand coffee it irritates my
[1017.80 - 1021.20] gut correct but for somebody else coffee
[1019.36 - 1023.20] is amazing I'll tell you an example for
[1021.20 - 1025.44] research wise they said that coffee
[1023.20 - 1027.60] chocolate citrus fruits have aggravated
[1025.44 - 1029.96] the acid exposure because it increases
[1027.60 - 1031.96] the acidity so before 5 years 10 years
[1029.96 - 1033.56] before we used to tell all patients when
[1031.96 - 1036.64] coming into the offic Stop chocolate
[1033.56 - 1038.52] stop coffee stop but the patient is
[1036.64 - 1041.00] telling me that when I eat chocolate it
[1038.52 - 1043.16] is nothing is happening to me I'm okay
[1041.00 - 1044.76] but when I drink tea yes that is
[1043.16 - 1046.12] happening there's a bio individuality
[1044.76 - 1048.68] the same way when I told recently
[1046.12 - 1050.36] somebody have guava to to increase of
[1048.68 - 1052.68] vitamin C this say I got a throat
[1050.36 - 1054.40] infection and I get cold and I actually
[1052.68 - 1056.64] saw this in a few of my clients that
[1054.40 - 1058.60] there's a biod digity so no one size
[1056.64 - 1060.56] fits all in food correct yeah does the
[1058.60 - 1063.00] same hold true for
[1060.56 - 1064.68] medicines yeah so that's why when we
[1063.00 - 1066.60] talked about the husk some patients
[1064.68 - 1068.96] may be able to tolerate it some I had a
[1066.60 - 1071.52] patient who got celum Mas constipation
[1068.96 - 1073.44] it could he's like I just can't touch it
[1071.52 - 1075.20] I couldn't poop for two days so I don't
[1073.44 - 1079.20] know what happened to that musk in
[1075.20 - 1082.60] his gut but you know the baking soda
[1079.20 - 1085.36] option um is there anything we can do to
[1082.60 - 1086.84] counter it um so what I tell my patients
[1085.36 - 1088.52] is whenever there's a nonm modifiable
[1086.84 - 1090.88] risk factor where you really absolutely
[1088.52 - 1092.36] love this baking soda it's okay but see
[1090.88 - 1094.00] whether you're able to check all the
[1092.36 - 1095.60] other risk factors that you can modify
[1094.00 - 1097.36] like sleeping properly eating all right
[1095.60 - 1099.68] at the other times and all those things
[1097.36 - 1103.56] okay simple Dr paling go to the
[1099.68 - 1105.36] nutritionist so risk for fatty liver and
[1103.56 - 1107.84] how it can be reversed now does the
[1105.36 - 1109.40] liver come in the gastro Department yes
[1107.84 - 1112.96] that's what it's called gastroenterology
[1109.40 - 1115.12] and hepatology hepatology is liver ah so
[1112.96 - 1116.16] I learned something today so doctor is
[1115.12 - 1118.56] also a
[1116.16 - 1120.68] hepatologist oh uh hepatology so there
[1118.56 - 1122.16] is one more year of Fellowship where
[1120.68 - 1125.32] people do just liver
[1122.16 - 1127.56] alone and in the entire human body let's
[1125.32 - 1130.32] say you are not a gastro or a
[1127.56 - 1133.32] herat according to you which is the most
[1130.32 - 1135.08] important system gut the gut even if I'm
[1133.32 - 1137.20] not a gastro I'm going to say gut yeah
[1135.08 - 1139.56] you know there's a joke that somebody
[1137.20 - 1142.64] said that you know all the organs had a
[1139.56 - 1144.76] had a meeting at a discoe and everyone
[1142.64 - 1147.48] was posturing that I'm the best in Dr
[1144.76 - 1149.32] Paul's body Brin says I'm number one the
[1147.48 - 1151.28] nose said I'm number one The Heart said
[1149.32 - 1155.48] I'm number one everybody said number one
[1151.28 - 1158.40] and then when the when the anus spinter
[1155.48 - 1161.72] muscle said I'm number one everyone
[1158.40 - 1163.84] laughed at the at the spinter so the
[1161.72 - 1166.08] said okay you guys are laughing he
[1163.84 - 1168.48] decided he decided to shut up everyone
[1166.08 - 1171.24] by stop working for 3 days all the
[1168.48 - 1173.60] system shut down or open up but
[1171.24 - 1175.92] inappropriate circumstan that's even
[1173.60 - 1178.12] worse that's even worse in my gastro
[1175.92 - 1180.56] control they say that the most important
[1178.12 - 1183.48] function that any other organ cannot do
[1180.56 - 1185.80] is use anal spinter muscle that anal
[1183.48 - 1188.80] spinter muscle to work properly there is
[1185.80 - 1191.12] so many things that has to go right and
[1188.80 - 1193.48] and correct me if I'm wrong if people
[1191.12 - 1195.20] have a lot of stress your anal spinter
[1193.48 - 1196.92] muscle goes for a to absolutely that's
[1195.20 - 1198.44] why you see this you know feal
[1196.92 - 1201.16] incontinence where they're not able able
[1198.44 - 1202.80] to hold the stool and they have leakage
[1201.16 - 1204.48] yeah that happens mainly mostly in
[1202.80 - 1207.16] neurological patients that's why they
[1204.48 - 1208.28] say there's a gut brain axis right okay
[1207.16 - 1210.28] we'll talk about that a little bit
[1208.28 - 1212.20] further uh but we talking about risk for
[1210.28 - 1213.84] fatty liver and how it can be reversed
[1212.20 - 1215.24] what's your take to people so fatty
[1213.84 - 1217.00] liver we see that every day on a daily
[1215.24 - 1218.96] basis two main risk factors one is
[1217.00 - 1220.76] alcohol and the other one is obesity but
[1218.96 - 1223.72] the problem is we drink alcohol and we
[1220.76 - 1226.32] eat Biryani as a side dish
[1223.72 - 1229.16] ah so there are three bees that goes for
[1226.32 - 1230.96] fatty liver one is biryani beer and
[1229.16 - 1232.56] belly fat people don't to give up
[1230.96 - 1236.16] Biryani and beer then they deny that
[1232.56 - 1238.36] they have belly fat so so we got a cast
[1236.16 - 1241.32] task cut out but look the doctor the
[1238.36 - 1243.16] gastro is saying get your belly fat down
[1241.32 - 1245.64] get your beer down that's alcohol
[1243.16 - 1247.32] correct and and B basically Biryani for
[1245.64 - 1250.32] those who are uninitiated and not from
[1247.32 - 1253.20] India it means food eating too much of
[1250.32 - 1254.96] food Biryani yeah yeah Biryani itself is
[1253.20 - 1257.72] an emotion that's a different
[1254.96 - 1259.80] story do you know the highest sour food
[1257.72 - 1261.72] on the e-commerce Platforms in India is
[1259.80 - 1263.16] Biryani abolutely which is why there's
[1261.72 - 1265.68] this full startup generation of
[1263.16 - 1268.08] different biryanis happening because we
[1265.68 - 1269.60] just love Biryani and so I think keep
[1268.08 - 1272.36] eating Biryani because you'll keep Dr
[1269.60 - 1274.20] Paul and me in business okay what is the
[1272.36 - 1277.12] alternative to white rice for South
[1274.20 - 1279.88] Indians from Telangana H so I have a
[1277.12 - 1281.44] wonderful hack for it I love white rice
[1279.88 - 1283.68] okay I always include white rice yes
[1281.44 - 1284.92] brown rice is good slightly better but I
[1283.68 - 1287.40] don't like the taste of the brown rice
[1284.92 - 1288.88] for me so I always do white rice but I
[1287.40 - 1291.40] just make sure that I have at least
[1288.88 - 1294.20] three servings of vegetables along with
[1291.40 - 1297.12] the white rice no matter what uh I try
[1294.20 - 1299.84] to if I have only one vegetables then I
[1297.12 - 1301.52] increase that serving okay so make sure
[1299.84 - 1303.88] that you have fiber from additional
[1301.52 - 1306.00] sources when you have white rice it's
[1303.88 - 1309.20] like when you go out parting make sure
[1306.00 - 1310.60] there's one person who is not drinking I
[1309.20 - 1312.36] think that's the equivalent of vegetable
[1310.60 - 1314.44] being there with rice they're
[1312.36 - 1317.64] celebrating with rice and the vegetables
[1314.44 - 1319.60] are behaving like the the driver that's
[1317.64 - 1321.36] going to take human and responsibly like
[1319.60 - 1322.80] everyone low blood sugar level you know
[1321.36 - 1324.16] I'm going to take care of your fiber the
[1322.80 - 1326.52] police is a gastroenterologist when they
[1324.16 - 1328.88] have oh fiber is there okay good we can
[1326.52 - 1332.56] leave you're not cutting a fine ticket
[1328.88 - 1335.76] at that point okay I'm a 21-year-old
[1332.56 - 1339.96] girl why do I have gastric issues when I
[1335.76 - 1342.76] eat fast food or oily Foods um is this
[1339.96 - 1344.76] is this a a Mis Noma that young people
[1342.76 - 1348.04] have indestructible
[1344.76 - 1351.60] guts yes no this this might be true in
[1348.04 - 1354.76] one way because their abuse has not been
[1351.60 - 1358.72] translated into clinical symptoms yet so
[1354.76 - 1361.16] but if you talk to a 40-year-old like me
[1358.72 - 1364.72] everybody will tell you that I wish I
[1361.16 - 1368.12] would have eaten right between 15 to 30
[1364.72 - 1369.36] I think the long-term damage I mean all
[1368.12 - 1372.00] this damage is long-term it doesn't
[1369.36 - 1374.12] happen right away and the actual effect
[1372.00 - 1376.20] happens 10 to 15 years after and that is
[1374.12 - 1378.76] the problem in fact the question has the
[1376.20 - 1380.52] answer itself because why do I have
[1378.76 - 1382.00] gastric issues when I eat fast food or
[1380.52 - 1383.96] oily Foods as a nutritionist I would
[1382.00 - 1386.52] tell you this the answer is in your
[1383.96 - 1388.80] question fast food and oily foods cause
[1386.52 - 1391.00] gastritis you are you you being
[1388.80 - 1393.16] activated and just because you're 21
[1391.00 - 1394.92] years of age doesn't mean you're immune
[1393.16 - 1397.32] to it it just means that Dr Paul gets
[1394.92 - 1399.28] you much younger as a patient you know
[1397.32 - 1401.24] so take care of what you put into your
[1399.28 - 1403.40] body so I say that you know people say
[1401.24 - 1406.28] oh I have hemorrhoids whenever I sit
[1403.40 - 1409.88] down uh I have pain I said don't sit
[1406.28 - 1409.88] down sit up
[1410.08 - 1416.04] the the patient must be thinking which
[1412.16 - 1419.28] doctor have I come to right now but uh
[1416.04 - 1422.40] with the sense of humor okay we moving
[1419.28 - 1424.56] from the solid Department to the gaseous
[1422.40 - 1427.00] department so Vapor Department after
[1424.56 - 1429.60] every meal there is gas formation in my
[1427.00 - 1431.72] stomach gas formation in my stomach so
[1429.60 - 1433.16] let's gas does gas form in the stomach
[1431.72 - 1436.28] does it form in the small intestine does
[1433.16 - 1438.00] it form in the large intestine and why
[1436.28 - 1439.88] is that gas production What could could
[1438.00 - 1442.20] be the reason yeah so there are two main
[1439.88 - 1444.20] reasons I think main problem with many
[1442.20 - 1446.48] people over here is I think irritable
[1444.20 - 1448.84] bubble syndrome IBS where your stomach
[1446.48 - 1450.64] and colon are extremely sensitive and
[1448.84 - 1452.12] the reason that it became sensitive is
[1450.64 - 1454.52] because it has not been fed the right
[1452.12 - 1456.68] amount of food that the intestine wants
[1454.52 - 1458.68] and what happens is due course of time
[1456.68 - 1460.72] it's always a balance between your good
[1458.68 - 1462.72] gut bacteria and your bad gut bacteria
[1460.72 - 1465.16] you want good gut to be up bad gut to be
[1462.72 - 1466.44] low so that the balance is perfect but
[1465.16 - 1467.40] because of the processed foods Ultra
[1466.44 - 1470.88] processed foods or whatever you are
[1467.40 - 1474.92] doing this balance is reverse and this
[1470.88 - 1477.44] bad gun bacteria loves sugar loves cars
[1474.92 - 1480.48] so you eat cup they make you crave for
[1477.44 - 1483.60] cups you eat crops and then the bacteria
[1480.48 - 1486.52] digests and then releases CO2 releases
[1483.60 - 1488.92] gas and then that can manifest as bloing
[1486.52 - 1490.56] it can manifest as flatulence and that's
[1488.92 - 1493.40] why we call there is a condition called
[1490.56 - 1495.60] sibo we call it as small intestinal
[1493.40 - 1496.92] bacterial overgrowth so they're not
[1495.60 - 1498.44] supposed to be there at that small
[1496.92 - 1501.72] intestine are that much amount of
[1498.44 - 1504.64] amounts so working with doctors is a
[1501.72 - 1507.08] privilege that I always have and Dr P
[1504.64 - 1509.56] for me is on free time with me right now
[1507.08 - 1511.20] on my podcast H shots so we going to ask
[1509.56 - 1514.56] you many questions that you've asked a
[1511.20 - 1518.04] very relevant question doc somebody
[1514.56 - 1521.08] asked us how to reduce creatinin
[1518.04 - 1524.32] levels in a diabetic patient I have two
[1521.08 - 1526.44] sub questions that what is creatinin and
[1524.32 - 1528.44] who is diabetic okay so diabetic is an
[1526.44 - 1530.84] easy answer okay you have like increased
[1528.44 - 1533.48] glucose levels your pancreas insulin
[1530.84 - 1536.24] regulation is not happening uh
[1533.48 - 1539.28] creatinine is a measurement of your
[1536.24 - 1541.60] kidney function the only way that we can
[1539.28 - 1544.84] find your kidney is working or not is a
[1541.60 - 1547.92] blood test okay if we shut down all the
[1544.84 - 1550.04] blood test in the world there is no way
[1547.92 - 1552.84] that we can find your kidney is damaged
[1550.04 - 1554.92] or not until it turns Advanced so
[1552.84 - 1556.76] creatinine is a basic essential thing so
[1554.92 - 1560.52] why are we talking about diabetes and
[1556.76 - 1562.92] creatinine is diabetes on a long-term uh
[1560.52 - 1565.16] in longterm effect it causes end organ
[1562.92 - 1568.04] damage which is including kidney so we
[1565.16 - 1570.52] call that as diabetic nephropathy where
[1568.04 - 1572.80] because of the uncontrolled diabetes the
[1570.52 - 1574.92] glucose levels have compromised the
[1572.80 - 1577.68] kidney function and how do we know the
[1574.92 - 1579.56] creatinine level will go up and we know
[1577.68 - 1581.52] on the routine blood check when people
[1579.56 - 1583.00] do it for diabetes and that's why
[1581.52 - 1584.72] patients with diabetes get routine blood
[1583.00 - 1586.92] checkup you know they check their eyes
[1584.72 - 1589.76] they check their foot because eyes is
[1586.92 - 1591.72] because of endog damage of the eyes and
[1589.76 - 1594.64] foot because the nerve supply to the
[1591.72 - 1597.00] foot gets uh compromised where they will
[1594.64 - 1600.44] not even feel hot or cold so they step
[1597.00 - 1602.52] on uh flow even with hot water they will
[1600.44 - 1604.48] not be able to figure out which means
[1602.52 - 1606.16] the glucose levels of the body so high
[1604.48 - 1608.12] that it has compromised the function of
[1606.16 - 1610.20] the nerves that's called diabetic
[1608.12 - 1612.84] neuropathy when it damages the retina of
[1610.20 - 1614.12] the ice it's called diabetic retinopathy
[1612.84 - 1616.60] and when it damages the kidneys it's
[1614.12 - 1619.36] called diabetic nephropathy and the last
[1616.60 - 1621.76] one is I a Gaston
[1619.36 - 1624.40] olist you know what I heard in all of
[1621.76 - 1627.88] that I just saw a sugar molecule
[1624.40 - 1629.56] slapping me sugar slapping my eyes sugar
[1627.88 - 1631.24] slapping my heart sugar slapping my
[1629.56 - 1632.84] kidney is that what it's doing pretty
[1631.24 - 1634.64] much high amounts of sugar where you're
[1632.84 - 1637.20] not able to manage again comes back to
[1634.64 - 1639.20] the long-term abuse of the body and so
[1637.20 - 1641.64] basically I think so when the person's
[1639.20 - 1643.88] asked us how to reduce creatinin levels
[1641.64 - 1645.84] in a diabetic patient so the ancus
[1643.88 - 1647.84] decrease the glucose levels kidney
[1645.84 - 1649.72] function will get better do think
[1647.84 - 1652.20] fasting would help
[1649.72 - 1654.64] absolutely absolutely you know uh have
[1652.20 - 1656.64] you had any crazy cases where you know
[1654.64 - 1658.92] the blood tests are like of all these
[1656.64 - 1661.92] kidneys and liver and whatever blood
[1658.92 - 1663.40] markers you check like they're all crazy
[1661.92 - 1665.92] and then you had a person change their
[1663.40 - 1668.48] diet and do fasting and have you seen
[1665.92 - 1671.60] miracles in like very fast period yeah
[1668.48 - 1673.52] you know this fasting sanm is very close
[1671.60 - 1675.36] to my heart so what I did was I started
[1673.52 - 1678.32] this um weightless program it's called
[1675.36 - 1681.80] new me new me new me okay it's an online
[1678.32 - 1684.76] weight loss program where I figure out
[1681.80 - 1686.48] whether they are diabetic or Not by a
[1684.76 - 1688.24] simple 35-year-old coming in you know I
[1686.48 - 1689.76] need to lose weight so we do some blood
[1688.24 - 1691.08] work and then you will be surprised
[1689.76 - 1693.68] where the A1C level which is the
[1691.08 - 1696.40] measurement of your diabetes is Sky High
[1693.68 - 1698.36] like 11 normal are only know like they
[1696.40 - 1700.64] don't even know that they even know
[1698.36 - 1702.24] right so then I said that you know I sit
[1700.64 - 1704.08] with them in my clinical practice that's
[1702.24 - 1706.20] what I do you know and then I check with
[1704.08 - 1708.44] them in terms of uh okay let's start
[1706.20 - 1710.32] with your fasting that ially we don't go
[1708.44 - 1711.84] like one meal a day no severe fasting
[1710.32 - 1713.72] because of the insulin diabetes
[1711.84 - 1716.28] regulation is a little bit very tricky
[1713.72 - 1718.28] fasting works but very carefully in
[1716.28 - 1720.36] diabetes along with the supervised
[1718.28 - 1724.20] regimen under a physician guidance so
[1720.36 - 1726.60] can I say that you truly are a doctor
[1724.20 - 1730.00] that prescribes fasting as a form of
[1726.60 - 1731.08] medical treatment also as a prescription
[1730.00 - 1732.92] yeah very
[1731.08 - 1734.72] individualized very individually that's
[1732.92 - 1737.16] a key that's a key yeah I don't go
[1734.72 - 1739.36] extremes at the same time one plan is
[1737.16 - 1741.52] not for the same for everybody I can say
[1739.36 - 1744.04] okay go for like 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
[1741.52 - 1746.64] I don't think that's a way okay doctor
[1744.04 - 1750.48] this is a female asking this question
[1746.64 - 1752.92] due to pcod tablets polycystic ovarian
[1750.48 - 1755.32] disorder I mean you know that but for
[1752.92 - 1756.96] those who are not aware outside so women
[1755.32 - 1759.96] have this condition which affects their
[1756.96 - 1761.64] ovaries they take a tablet I'm not aware
[1759.96 - 1764.28] what the medication
[1761.64 - 1768.56] is so she says I'm not able to consume
[1764.28 - 1771.64] any proper food any suggestions so PCOS
[1768.56 - 1774.12] is not a disease it is linked to your
[1771.64 - 1777.28] circadian rhythm it's linked to your
[1774.12 - 1780.24] hormonal imbalance unfortunately women
[1777.28 - 1782.16] are at a disadvantage compared to us
[1780.24 - 1784.68] because women have so many hormones to
[1782.16 - 1786.24] be balanced estrogen progesterone all we
[1784.68 - 1789.04] have is testosterone and we get away
[1786.24 - 1791.00] with it and they go through so much
[1789.04 - 1793.40] hormonal changes every month can you
[1791.00 - 1795.68] imagine every cell is dying and then
[1793.40 - 1799.20] waking up again generating again every
[1795.68 - 1801.64] month they go through a lot for them to
[1799.20 - 1803.88] have a good balanced hormones their
[1801.64 - 1806.28] circadian rythm has to be even on the
[1803.88 - 1808.04] top of the game and uh the medication
[1806.28 - 1809.96] that she's talking about is metformin
[1808.04 - 1811.84] what metformin does is it just tries to
[1809.96 - 1813.64] improve the sensitivity of the insulin
[1811.84 - 1815.40] so the insulin Works a little bit more
[1813.64 - 1818.24] so that the OM follicles and everything
[1815.40 - 1820.28] can um come out with good quality by
[1818.24 - 1822.68] collaborating with estrogen Prestone so
[1820.28 - 1825.60] as a doctor would you say that's one
[1822.68 - 1828.84] part of helping women along the pcod
[1825.60 - 1831.76] journey or reducing it is weight loss
[1828.84 - 1834.20] Big Time weight loss is not one part
[1831.76 - 1836.12] that is the major part if they lose
[1834.20 - 1838.12] weight they will not be any medications
[1836.12 - 1840.88] at all so I'm just my mind is going
[1838.12 - 1844.20] 30,000 Cycles a second because nowadays
[1840.88 - 1845.88] I'm getting a lot of teenagers 18 19 20
[1844.20 - 1849.36] 21 year old girls coming into our
[1845.88 - 1852.64] nutrition clinic with pcod condition and
[1849.36 - 1855.92] could one of the prescriptions be I need
[1852.64 - 1858.48] to get your body fat percentage down all
[1855.92 - 1860.76] your prescription should have it
[1858.48 - 1863.12] uh that that's a no-brainer it has to be
[1860.76 - 1865.20] I think the bottom line mechanism is
[1863.12 - 1867.24] because of this distance now she says
[1865.20 - 1869.92] you're not able to consume proper food
[1867.24 - 1872.12] so I don't know if teenagers or girls or
[1869.92 - 1874.96] ladies consume proper food all the time
[1872.12 - 1877.08] but do you think that metformin can also
[1874.96 - 1879.36] uh blun your appetite or affect you
[1877.08 - 1881.40] metformin can influence your uh gastric
[1879.36 - 1883.08] uh dis as a gastro youve seen people
[1881.40 - 1886.04] that take medication and it changes
[1883.08 - 1888.04] their so we usually saw diarrhea people
[1886.04 - 1889.88] take B Forin and then they just start
[1888.04 - 1891.72] having like more loose tools compared to
[1889.88 - 1894.08] before so then we decrease the dose AG
[1891.72 - 1895.68] we adjust accordingly okay somebody's
[1894.08 - 1899.08] asking can we have tea or coffee once in
[1895.68 - 1900.96] a while I feel gastric discomfort when I
[1899.08 - 1903.48] consume it regularly my mother-in-law
[1900.96 - 1906.64] she's a gynecologist she's a South
[1903.48 - 1909.16] Indian tamb Bram she loves her coffee
[1906.64 - 1911.24] this sounds like her right now please
[1909.16 - 1914.84] suggest whether I can drink it once in a
[1911.24 - 1917.92] blue no absolutely provide that if it is
[1914.84 - 1919.36] if your stomach is okay with it when you
[1917.92 - 1921.12] when you when you got a wound and it's
[1919.36 - 1922.88] hurting you you can't go and dig into
[1921.12 - 1924.32] that wound is is what you're saying
[1922.88 - 1927.28] right but when you do all the other
[1924.32 - 1929.60] stuffs right that wound will be healed
[1927.28 - 1931.84] and you can go back to your routine so
[1929.60 - 1933.72] are you saying that kind of dig a little
[1931.84 - 1935.80] bit deeper and see why you're facing a
[1933.72 - 1937.36] problem and don't blame tea or coffee
[1935.80 - 1937.96] there could be other triggers that's
[1937.36 - 1939.14] what you want to tell your
[1937.96 - 1943.40] brother-in-law
[1939.14 - 1947.44] [Laughter]
[1943.40 - 1951.20] yeah my mental health affects my
[1947.44 - 1955.08] digestion how can I fix it or improve it
[1951.20 - 1957.20] sleep me time your mental health and
[1955.08 - 1958.84] your digestion is linked with a common
[1957.20 - 1960.88] mechanism called sleep that's why you're
[1958.84 - 1962.96] talking about cirium which is part of
[1960.88 - 1965.40] the sleep cycle and the Wake Up Cycle
[1962.96 - 1968.68] your body needs rest we just abusing it
[1965.40 - 1970.20] so much just slow down take rest make
[1968.68 - 1972.68] sure that you have 7 hours of quality
[1970.20 - 1974.64] sleep your body's hormones are so
[1972.68 - 1977.00] powerful than what you think I am
[1974.64 - 1979.28] predicting and I can see the future and
[1977.00 - 1981.68] and I can see the present I'm in Dr
[1979.28 - 1986.60] Paul's consultancy Clinic he's writing
[1981.68 - 1990.12] on his prescription pad less watching of
[1986.60 - 1993.20] Netflix no binge watching of Netflix
[1990.12 - 1994.88] correct acidity will disappear gut brain
[1993.20 - 1997.88] access will improve if you're watching
[1994.88 - 1999.92] Ryan channel it's okay but we we are
[1997.88 - 2002.40] only 45 minutes and watch us during the

[2005.76 - 2010.20] friendly how how to overcome vitamin
[2008.40 - 2012.32] deficiencies in vegetarian in America do
[2010.20 - 2014.52] you see a lot of vegetarians Huge lot
[2012.32 - 2016.84] lot of our Indians are vegetarian right
[2014.52 - 2020.04] and not indians American people they're
[2016.84 - 2022.20] also deficient yeah it becoming like a a
[2020.04 - 2023.56] fashionable state so so what's it like I
[2022.20 - 2025.16] would love to be the fly on the wall in
[2023.56 - 2027.64] your consultation room somebody comes
[2025.16 - 2029.36] and like hey Doc I'm vgy I'm vegan I'm
[2027.64 - 2030.32] vegetarian and then you're looking at
[2029.36 - 2032.28] them and you're like what are you
[2030.32 - 2033.76] looking for I like looking at the blood
[2032.28 - 2035.72] test are you looking at anything from
[2033.76 - 2037.44] their body how how does it work how does
[2035.72 - 2039.12] your brain work or mind work work with
[2037.44 - 2040.80] such people walking in when they say
[2039.12 - 2042.56] they're vegetarian like how how you
[2040.80 - 2045.36] clinically diagnosing
[2042.56 - 2047.08] people um like for example somebody
[2045.36 - 2050.16] walks in can you say that they
[2047.08 - 2052.28] vegetarian or vacon very difficult yeah
[2050.16 - 2054.00] I but the moment they tell you that then
[2052.28 - 2056.08] so but actually I can say based on
[2054.00 - 2059.96] looking at the stomach and colon I can
[2056.08 - 2061.96] guess educated guests ah so I've seen
[2059.96 - 2064.36] and you see vitamin deficiencies from
[2061.96 - 2067.04] that no no vitam deficiency we're
[2064.36 - 2069.60] talking about B12 deficiency as you know
[2067.04 - 2071.72] uh long that is not a huge problem
[2069.60 - 2073.44] because even if you are deficient in B12
[2071.72 - 2075.40] supplementation takes care of the
[2073.44 - 2076.88] problem um so that is not a huge thing
[2075.40 - 2078.72] what I was trying to say was gut
[2076.88 - 2080.20] bacteria loves vegetarian food more than
[2078.72 - 2081.44] non-vegetarian food that is kind of
[2080.20 - 2083.44] proven on basic science research and
[2081.44 - 2085.92] also clinical research well so when we
[2083.44 - 2088.52] do the endoscopy a camera going to the
[2085.92 - 2090.12] stomach we see I personally feel like
[2088.52 - 2092.92] the stomach is less
[2090.12 - 2094.36] angry and I ask them who you know or you
[2092.92 - 2096.96] after the procedure I ask them or you
[2094.36 - 2099.00] vegetarian they'll say yes same thing in
[2096.96 - 2101.36] if I do a colonoscopy I don't see any
[2099.00 - 2104.84] pops at all and then that PO patient
[2101.36 - 2107.40] will be a 65y old Caucasian man how can
[2104.84 - 2109.32] you are not having a poip you eat your
[2107.40 - 2111.36] diet is like processed meat and
[2109.32 - 2113.60] everything uh he said no I'm a
[2111.36 - 2115.52] vegetarian so I'm going to throw a
[2113.60 - 2118.96] little bit of controversy into the pot
[2115.52 - 2121.56] there are doctors out there in the West
[2118.96 - 2123.72] for the Western Caucasian population
[2121.56 - 2125.88] that are recommending only a meat diet
[2123.72 - 2127.40] carore diet the carnivore diet right so
[2125.88 - 2129.88] you've heard about this
[2127.40 - 2131.68] yeah yeah have you seen Carnivor come in
[2129.88 - 2134.24] and do the endoscopy and you're seeing
[2131.68 - 2136.12] disaster inside of them a lot of pops
[2134.24 - 2138.28] but have you also seen like the
[2136.12 - 2140.52] vegetarian a clear gut is it
[2138.28 - 2142.04] bioindividual also for people when yes
[2140.52 - 2145.48] yes absolutely it is bio individual but
[2142.04 - 2147.60] the probability the probability is lower
[2145.48 - 2148.84] in a vegetarian diet but doesn't mean
[2147.60 - 2150.72] that you know meat is wrong what I'm
[2148.84 - 2154.32] what I'm trying to say is our gun
[2150.72 - 2156.00] bacteria loves fiber and fiber is in
[2154.32 - 2157.52] vegetarian food if you're having
[2156.00 - 2160.16] nonvegetarian make sure that you have
[2157.52 - 2162.04] lots of fiber as well I'm going to be
[2160.16 - 2164.20] having my steak with a lot of broccoli
[2162.04 - 2166.36] cucumber and zucchini so that's what I
[2164.20 - 2167.76] want to be doing yeah yeah so one thing
[2166.36 - 2170.20] I want to tell you was I always tell my
[2167.76 - 2171.28] patients don't choose vegetarian or
[2170.20 - 2174.48] don't choose
[2171.28 - 2177.48] non-vegetarian be do palarian what's
[2174.48 - 2180.16] that Dr palarian Dr palarian is you know
[2177.48 - 2183.04] three meals a day yeah 7 days a week 21
[2180.16 - 2186.56] meals a week yes and out of this 21 80%
[2183.04 - 2188.24] vegetarian so 15 16 meals is vegetarian
[2186.56 - 2189.80] then remaining four meals you go
[2188.24 - 2191.64] non-vegetarian and you can eat whatever
[2189.80 - 2193.36] you want if you're eating red meat limit
[2191.64 - 2195.92] to 500 G per
[2193.36 - 2199.88] week that's a nice one I've never heard
[2195.92 - 2202.96] before limit nonvegetarian to 500 G no
[2199.88 - 2205.96] no red meat red meat uh to 500 G per
[2202.96 - 2208.76] week if possible correct nice one one
[2205.96 - 2212.40] common problem in gastric issues we are
[2208.76 - 2214.56] seeing is that um more and more of the
[2212.40 - 2218.44] teenagers more and more of the working
[2214.56 - 2220.48] individuals are complaining of gastric
[2218.44 - 2223.40] problems and we're talking about an age
[2220.48 - 2225.96] group of 15 to 30 but you're seeing a
[2223.40 - 2227.24] lot of older people so is there
[2225.96 - 2229.12] something that you seeing in your
[2227.24 - 2231.80] practice where more youngsters are
[2229.12 - 2233.12] coming in with gastric problem so I I
[2231.80 - 2234.88] when when a patient walks in there are
[2233.12 - 2238.68] only two age groups that walks into my
[2234.88 - 2242.52] patient office one is 60 65 and other
[2238.68 - 2244.52] one is 20 30 so the 2030s are walking in
[2242.52 - 2248.28] because of because of abdominal pain
[2244.52 - 2250.08] crms bloating uh oh this food is not
[2248.28 - 2253.24] adapting to my gut you know what should
[2250.08 - 2255.60] I do and the first question that I ask
[2253.24 - 2257.92] is what are you doing uh in terms of a
[2255.60 - 2260.40] profession and most of the times
[2257.92 - 2263.84] especially in India uh when I see
[2260.40 - 2268.40] patients uh they work for a foreign
[2263.84 - 2271.56] company in us and they work night shift
[2268.40 - 2273.12] and they work from 10: p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
[2271.56 - 2275.20] where the graveyard shift graveyard
[2273.12 - 2278.12] shift because it's in us it's the
[2275.20 - 2279.76] morning time correct right and uh again
[2278.12 - 2281.48] you're disturbing a sarian rhythm the
[2279.76 - 2283.36] first thing that goes wrong when you're
[2281.48 - 2286.40] disturbing a sarian rhythm is gut and
[2283.36 - 2288.40] that's why they say go with your gut I'm
[2286.40 - 2291.64] going to go a little Star Trek on our
[2288.40 - 2293.76] podcast the gut microbiome I read a
[2291.64 - 2295.48] study somewhere that they have started
[2293.76 - 2298.68] fecal Bank
[2295.48 - 2301.12] transplants um can you talk to us about
[2298.68 - 2304.40] what is this fecal Bank transplant and
[2301.12 - 2307.32] is it true that when they take uh the
[2304.40 - 2308.60] donor FAL and put it into a bad person
[2307.32 - 2310.80] there have been incidences of
[2308.60 - 2312.48] improvement of the gut health yes we do
[2310.80 - 2314.84] you know we do fecal transplantation for
[2312.48 - 2316.68] a disease called C diffusal colitis okay
[2314.84 - 2318.56] where it is a bacteria that comes into
[2316.68 - 2321.76] the body and affects the colon and makes
[2318.56 - 2324.04] the colon looks very inflamed and angry
[2321.76 - 2325.60] and uh no matter what medication that we
[2324.04 - 2328.84] give we will not be able to is it true
[2325.60 - 2331.64] SE defil tries in a non-v environment
[2328.84 - 2333.28] non non-vegetarian diet no I mean I
[2331.64 - 2334.64] don't why does this bad guy come into
[2333.28 - 2337.80] the body oh because of you know
[2334.64 - 2340.36] antibiotic exposure so we do lots of
[2337.80 - 2341.80] antibiotics and uh you know whenever
[2340.36 - 2343.76] there is Factor as multiple antibiotic
[2341.80 - 2344.76] exposure then you'll see the fil gets so
[2343.76 - 2346.92] we see this in
[2344.76 - 2350.36] children yes but not that common not
[2346.92 - 2352.20] that common uh adult Big T so an athlete
[2350.36 - 2354.36] one day came to me and says sir can I do
[2352.20 - 2356.88] feal transplant because I heard that a
[2354.36 - 2359.64] faster athlete has better bacteria so
[2356.88 - 2362.08] can I get his poop into me so is there
[2359.64 - 2364.24] any logic to this do you see Medical
[2362.08 - 2366.48] Science going in that direction I think
[2364.24 - 2368.76] 5 years from now we'll be talking some
[2366.48 - 2370.20] kind of sense but not right now okay but
[2368.76 - 2374.04] multiple research are going in that
[2370.20 - 2376.20] field though but nothing concrete um so
[2374.04 - 2380.08] but it is true in maice when you
[2376.20 - 2382.52] transplant uh a bad bacteria into a good
[2380.08 - 2385.08] good bacteria the maice will have
[2382.52 - 2387.72] behavioral problems we have anxiety
[2385.08 - 2389.40] issues um well that'll be translated
[2387.72 - 2392.40] into clinical practice that's what
[2389.40 - 2396.88] people are doing right now so is it true
[2392.40 - 2399.80] that before our body digests food the
[2396.88 - 2402.48] bacteria in our gut the microbiome
[2399.80 - 2404.04] actually first eats the food uh no no
[2402.48 - 2405.80] that's not true because when you when
[2404.04 - 2407.72] you eating it goes into the stomach the
[2405.80 - 2409.68] stomach as it digest the food and then
[2407.72 - 2412.60] gets into the small intestine and we get
[2409.68 - 2414.92] the first bite ah small intestine has
[2412.60 - 2418.08] all these enzymes like pancreas secretes
[2414.92 - 2419.88] enzyme digesting fats you know stomach
[2418.08 - 2421.68] also secrete digesting proteins and
[2419.88 - 2423.88] carbs all these are getting digested in
[2421.68 - 2425.40] your small intestine and after
[2423.88 - 2427.76] everything is done only the roughage
[2425.40 - 2430.12] goes into the coal and that rff should
[2427.76 - 2433.60] have fiber to feed the bacteria in the
[2430.12 - 2435.00] colon U so they get the second bite but
[2433.60 - 2437.88] we need to make sure that we feed them
[2435.00 - 2439.08] as well interesting this is my question
[2437.88 - 2442.04] it's a funny
[2439.08 - 2444.92] question how much of farting defines you
[2442.04 - 2446.92] to be a fter or not a fter is there a
[2444.92 - 2449.52] medical Benchmark because people come to
[2446.92 - 2451.64] me and says I got a lot of gas so I ask
[2449.52 - 2454.52] them have you farted in my chamber right
[2451.64 - 2457.48] now so they no like you don't have a gas
[2454.52 - 2459.40] problem so how do we how do we advise
[2457.48 - 2462.08] people because people have different
[2459.40 - 2464.36] senses of laughter different senses of
[2462.08 - 2466.44] I'm strong you're strong I'm not
[2464.36 - 2469.28] stronger so from a farting perspective
[2466.44 - 2471.48] gas production burping and farting what
[2469.28 - 2473.08] do you think is a sense of a barometer
[2471.48 - 2477.00] so I think it is again individualized
[2473.08 - 2479.80] it's based on you know how frequent it
[2477.00 - 2481.44] is and then key thing is what are the
[2479.80 - 2483.16] other G problem that you are having
[2481.44 - 2484.96] let's say you are having constipation
[2483.16 - 2487.96] you're having bloating then that
[2484.96 - 2489.36] flatulence is a significant problem
[2487.96 - 2492.80] interesting
[2489.36 - 2494.72] so what I do is I tell a person eat a
[2492.80 - 2497.00] certain food and tell me three to four
[2494.72 - 2499.52] hours later are you creating more gas
[2497.00 - 2501.84] huh that's true the first treatment that
[2499.52 - 2505.04] we do when patients come with flatulence
[2501.84 - 2507.16] is food diary ah so you document
[2505.04 - 2508.76] everything what you eat when when is the
[2507.16 - 2511.48] most amount of gas
[2508.76 - 2514.56] production if Tesla could only run on
[2511.48 - 2517.16] human gas we would have uh indigenous
[2514.56 - 2518.56] vehicles and the patients will ask me uh
[2517.16 - 2521.36] sir is it has to be a written format or
[2518.56 - 2522.84] you want a video format I said no
[2521.36 - 2525.00] written format is okay I was about to
[2522.84 - 2528.00] ask you is there audio included in that
[2525.00 - 2530.28] like what level of velocity of noise are
[2528.00 - 2531.60] you creating so much of volume of gas so
[2530.28 - 2536.28] much of
[2531.60 - 2538.56] decb but jok's apart as people get older
[2536.28 - 2541.44] right as I have gotten old and I'm
[2538.56 - 2543.56] moving towards my 50s I've noticed in
[2541.44 - 2546.72] certain foods on certain days that I eat
[2543.56 - 2549.72] I will produce more gas I will will fart
[2546.72 - 2551.12] more and sometimes it's um it's
[2549.72 - 2554.28] embarrassing because you try to get the
[2551.12 - 2556.88] silent fart and you know it's the noisy
[2554.28 - 2559.64] fart that's also still good but then you
[2556.88 - 2562.20] get the smelly fart as a gastro doctor
[2559.64 - 2563.72] are we looking for anything which can
[2562.20 - 2566.20] tell us that you need to change your
[2563.72 - 2568.52] diet or change your health in the gas
[2566.20 - 2570.20] department so whenever the flatulance is
[2568.52 - 2572.32] bothering you know whenever it is
[2570.20 - 2573.56] compromising the quality of life so for
[2572.32 - 2576.68] example I've sent many patient know I'm
[2573.56 - 2579.60] in the meeting and uh you know I need to
[2576.68 - 2581.80] run to the restaurant to have the gas
[2579.60 - 2584.24] released uh and it is happening very
[2581.80 - 2585.96] repeatedly and that's where the problem
[2584.24 - 2588.24] is right and then invariably as we
[2585.96 - 2590.68] talked about most of the times it is a
[2588.24 - 2593.36] dis it is a lack of balance between a
[2590.68 - 2595.76] good and bad good bacteria few Common
[2593.36 - 2598.12] Sense questions is it true that
[2595.76 - 2599.80] everybody in the human race has to go to
[2598.12 - 2601.76] party first thing in the morning
[2599.80 - 2603.16] absolutely not true not true right abely
[2601.76 - 2604.64] not true you've seen different patients
[2603.16 - 2607.44] party at different times of the yeah
[2604.64 - 2609.44] even you know the normal M you know when
[2607.44 - 2611.40] you eat something and comes out of the
[2609.44 - 2614.84] Sprinter muscle it usually takes like
[2611.40 - 2617.40] you know 50 hours 50 hours so India
[2614.84 - 2619.76] listen in carefully you don't need to go
[2617.40 - 2621.76] to the toilet every day to decide that
[2619.76 - 2624.08] you have a constipation problem
[2621.76 - 2627.32] absolutely now if I ask that
[2624.08 - 2628.88] question do people have a poy move if
[2627.32 - 2632.08] it's 50 hours you're talking about
[2628.88 - 2633.72] almost two days sometimes huh so if you
[2632.08 - 2635.56] ideally many of the patients will go
[2633.72 - 2637.76] like once a day uh because of the you
[2635.56 - 2639.40] know uh my athletes go two three times a
[2637.76 - 2641.24] day because obviously I'm feeding them
[2639.40 - 2644.92] more right maybe a lot of fiber we don't
[2641.24 - 2647.00] know yeah but but so to so let me let me
[2644.92 - 2649.12] track back and then say thaty actually a
[2647.00 - 2651.84] definition of constipation itself it's
[2649.12 - 2653.56] not like if you don't go once a day you
[2651.84 - 2655.48] see what is your normal Baseline so you
[2653.56 - 2657.88] go once every two days once every 3 days
[2655.48 - 2660.28] it's absolutely okay but you have been
[2657.88 - 2663.32] going once every 3 days but now it's
[2660.28 - 2665.12] once in 7 Days that's constipation that
[2663.32 - 2668.88] what is the change in the frequency of
[2665.12 - 2670.96] the B moment I this client of mine and
[2668.88 - 2676.24] he constantly complains that I go to the
[2670.96 - 2679.40] toilet I sit down and I have sensation
[2676.24 - 2681.44] to potty but nothing comes out what is
[2679.40 - 2683.72] that called and what could be the
[2681.44 - 2686.72] probable reasons so it's called tenesmus
[2683.72 - 2689.00] kind of thing okay uh where you go to
[2686.72 - 2690.84] the bathroom and you have the feeling of
[2689.00 - 2693.20] evacuation but the evacuation is not
[2690.84 - 2695.24] happening which means that the brain is
[2693.20 - 2697.16] not talking to the gut properly so it's
[2695.24 - 2699.56] like a biof feedback
[2697.16 - 2701.88] mechanism can that be retrained back
[2699.56 - 2703.92] again yes absolutely yes so they need to
[2701.88 - 2707.52] contact a gastroenterologist for them
[2703.92 - 2710.48] right no I know if you dive deep into it
[2707.52 - 2712.20] the basic Lifestyle Changes will be the
[2710.48 - 2714.92] treatment of choice do you prescribe
[2712.20 - 2717.36] walking for any of these conditions gas
[2714.92 - 2719.76] indigestion IBS and all so physical
[2717.36 - 2722.72] activity has been shown to promote good
[2719.76 - 2724.92] get bacteria so exercising gives me good
[2722.72 - 2727.08] bacteria which keeps my gut healthy
[2724.92 - 2728.92] absolutely another prescription is
[2727.08 - 2732.08] please
[2728.92 - 2734.48] exercise what exercise so actually
[2732.08 - 2736.36] anything any even walking is also okay
[2734.48 - 2738.60] but has to be a little bit of a faster
[2736.36 - 2740.60] pace and I think walking shakes
[2738.60 - 2743.12] everything out of your body as it keeps

[2876.04 - 2881.28] those are the five tips from Dr Paul Dr
[2878.32 - 2884.00] Paul if you were not a gastro I know
[2881.28 - 2885.48] you'd say standup comedian but if not a
[2884.00 - 2887.96] standup comedian and gastro what would
[2885.48 - 2890.40] you be you know I want to be a a
[2887.96 - 2893.24] lifestyle physician okay I want to tell
[2890.40 - 2894.52] patients that family doctor maybe no see
[2893.24 - 2896.44] what what's a family doctor and what's a
[2894.52 - 2898.32] lifestyle physician see family doctor is
[2896.44 - 2900.76] you know treats all the problems right
[2898.32 - 2903.24] uh so let's say you have asthma so he
[2900.76 - 2905.28] needs inhalers and he uh treats all
[2903.24 - 2907.68] those things when I say lifesty
[2905.28 - 2909.96] physician is now I have figured out that
[2907.68 - 2912.24] all the problems is are caused by the
[2909.96 - 2913.64] lifestyle okay our nutrition plays a big
[2912.24 - 2916.12] role that's why I have a huge respect
[2913.64 - 2919.00] for what you do nutritionist is not easy
[2916.12 - 2921.40] job so nutrition generally seeing the
[2919.00 - 2924.24] patient as a whole and not just focusing
[2921.40 - 2926.80] on the asthma alone and if I have a time
[2924.24 - 2930.04] I will spend two hours with a patient
[2926.80 - 2932.08] every week for 3 months I'll make sure
[2930.04 - 2933.84] that they will never get a problem ever
[2932.08 - 2937.56] again so that they will never see a
[2933.84 - 2940.44] doctor awesome awesome I want quick
[2937.56 - 2942.12] digestion I want quick answers and who
[2940.44 - 2946.80] better than Dr Paul to give us a rapid
[2942.12 - 2949.28] fire okay eating Sprouts raw cooked and
[2946.80 - 2953.68] to be honest both are
[2949.28 - 2955.72] okay raw meat good for your stomach not
[2953.68 - 2959.64] good for your stomach raw meat yeah
[2955.72 - 2963.12] Sushi Oh sushi okay in general our G
[2959.64 - 2965.08] bacteria is better on vegetarian let me
[2963.12 - 2967.04] put it that way so but doesn't mean that
[2965.08 - 2969.16] you know one typi or something is bad
[2967.04 - 2971.36] but from a gastro that's a gastrologist
[2969.16 - 2973.40] answer there's this article saying
[2971.36 - 2976.36] playing in mud restores microbiome for
[2973.40 - 2978.48] kids your take yes absolutely so we
[2976.36 - 2980.64] should go back and get dirty absolutely
[2978.48 - 2982.88] no question stop using too much of
[2980.64 - 2985.68] sanitizers and chemicals in the house
[2982.88 - 2988.76] yes big time what should we look in
[2985.68 - 2991.36] ingredients before buying them the first
[2988.76 - 2993.24] three ingredient should not be sugar
[2991.36 - 2996.36] first three should not be sugar that's a
[2993.24 - 2999.32] good one okay how do we preper gut for
[2996.36 - 3002.64] long use of antibiotic medicines so
[2999.32 - 3004.44] antibiotics destroys the cut bacteria so
[3002.64 - 3006.60] so basically I always tell in all
[3004.44 - 3009.64] podcasts that the biggest pandemic that
[3006.60 - 3011.72] we are waiting to happen is antibiotic
[3009.64 - 3013.76] resistant bacteria where we will not
[3011.72 - 3017.08] have weapons like antibiotics to kill
[3013.76 - 3018.80] the bacteria so limit antibiotic use as
[3017.08 - 3021.32] much as possible and only take
[3018.80 - 3024.08] antibiotic only when prescribed by a
[3021.32 - 3026.24] doctor you cannot walk into a pharmacy
[3024.08 - 3028.88] and then say please give me some
[3026.24 - 3030.76] antibiotics things in our system that we
[3028.88 - 3034.24] Indians are adopting that are very bad
[3030.76 - 3037.32] considering food as an
[3034.24 - 3039.96] emotion doesn't have to be get logical
[3037.32 - 3043.04] turn it down a little bit so doctor I
[3039.96 - 3045.92] know your time is precious we got you
[3043.04 - 3049.64] for a few minutes and we answered
[3045.92 - 3052.16] everyone's questions so if you love Dr
