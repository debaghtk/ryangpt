[226.08 - 231.60] There is a process, I enjoy it now
[229.00 - 234.28] I was in Dubai but I didn't know that before
[231.60 - 235.92] I will play wrestling match then after that I
[234.28 - 239.80] I watched because wrestling has been very popular for two years
[235.92 - 242.84] Brijbhushan is famous for different reasons
[239.80 - 245.80] Yes, then what about your aspiring children

[257.80 - 264.64] First Brand Ambassador of Federation of India
[259.40 - 266.60] It was in 2014-15, ok then he said that bhaiya enough
[264.64 - 269.16] Something different was happening and I was doing it every day
[266.60 - 271.32] When I was watching it I felt like brother
[269.16 - 273.28] Wrestling is going backwards, I won't say it
[271.32 - 277.76] that someone is right or wrong, someone is right or wrong
[273.28 - 281.40] There is no time, as they say, that which
[277.76 - 285.88] What were colors yesterday are stains today, what was the color of time yesterday
[281.40 - 288.40] There was a stain today, wow, time is powerful
[285.88 - 292.12] That is a different thing then when I go to Dubai
[288.40 - 295.08] would you believe in this judge that I
[292.12 - 297.72] Where did I prepare for this I think I
[295.08 - 300.24] think you are 22 years old how old are you
[297.72 - 303.08] No, my body age is 1415 years, yes
[300.24 - 305.24] So the judge cannot know whether you are in 40 or not
[303.08 - 307.80] Yes, it doesn't matter if you're up or down
[305.24 - 310.00] it's in the mind or it's in the mind like
[307.80 - 312.44] you become what you think and another
[310.00 - 314.52] Let me tell you what we think, brother
[312.44 - 316.12] Eat this protein, eat these vitamins, eat this water
[314.52 - 319.72] I read many cricket players from outside
[316.12 - 322.48] drink the water i am telling you
[319.72 - 324.48] right? drink water from the pond or the well
[322.48 - 326.28] If you didn't think that I was the best person in the world
[324.48 - 329.32] If I drink good water then my body works
[326.28 - 332.88] You will do what you have in mind
[329.32 - 336.28] Meaning you are saying that the vibration of yours
[332.88 - 339.80] should be the most powerful and influential who
[336.28 - 342.72] something that comes close to you or what you're drinking
[339.80 - 346.24] or what you are eating you are telling vibrate

[350.40 - 355.72] But your mentality should be good

[355.72 - 360.64] The way you drink water, the way your company will be

[360.64 - 364.48] Vitamin Miller did not get confused who
[362.44 - 369.40] I eat whatever I get and I'm happy
[364.48 - 372.40] hmm super i have a study to share with you
[369.40 - 376.48] Do a study of a milkshake in America
[372.40 - 380.80] okay there were two people inside the auditorium
[376.48 - 383.32] one group told me brother you we you
[380.80 - 387.16] A good healthy milkshake
[383.32 - 390.60] Milkshake will give low calories on the other hand
[387.16 - 393.68] Brother will tell you high calorie high fat
[390.60 - 397.44] unhealthy mill will give shake and then their
[393.68 - 401.96] The blood sample will give C-reactive protein which
[397.44 - 406.28] Inflammatory mark means itching inside the body
[401.96 - 409.80] Itchy Slap Now What Did Scientist Do
[406.28 - 411.52] He changed both the milkshakes and
[409.80 - 414.64] No to Participant
[411.52 - 418.28] told the struggle what was the result i atlee

[418.28 - 423.92] that we will get a good milkshake
[421.28 - 427.44] Calorie low fat is very good for our health
[423.92 - 431.48] Well, I got that dirty milkshake and

[434.32 - 440.48] is the human mind can reduce
[437.28 - 444.48] inflammation in the body so there is actually
[440.48 - 448.08] A study and if everybody gives this will apply
[444.48 - 450.44] To the body and the life of Ryan Fernando
[448.08 - 452.72] I don't have a job, run brother, look at me

[452.72 - 458.04] We are very strong, we cannot survive minor illnesses
[455.44 - 460.56] There won't be any post mortem with these things
[458.04 - 462.20] I have to cut it with a knife so
[460.56 - 464.04] I should not be afraid of small things
[462.20 - 466.40] Do you know what kind of a man you are, if you become like me
[464.04 - 467.64] Then the doctors will also sit at home, everyone will sit at home
[466.40 - 469.40] because I am what that heart is

[478.08 - 481.64] One should not eat after sunset
[479.72 - 483.44] Hey brother, we are all businessmen.

[574.52 - 578.76] I work out, I don't think unnecessarily
[577.08 - 581.12] I don't pay unnecessary attention to what is there, look at it
[578.76 - 583.08] We are all running, but no one has to reach
[581.12 - 585.60] there is no place to come with clenched fist
[583.08 - 588.48] Open up and go through the process of life
[585.60 - 590.40] to enjoy it is to enjoy it and to enjoy it
[588.48 - 592.72] Same is the wrestling match I am playing now
[590.40 - 596.68] You will laugh, where was he in Dubai, in Dubai
[592.72 - 601.00] The boy was 17 years younger than me, okay?
[596.68 - 604.48] And the coach was like that, when he was active he used to play
[601.00 - 606.32] I was wondering where this old man had come from
[604.48 - 608.76] If you offer it like this then it means that
[606.32 - 611.44] no hey this is that hold it hold it understand
[608.76 - 612.52] If you are there then you do it but an old one
[611.44 - 615.72] There is a saying
[612.52 - 618.56] that when you have killed an elephant then you can kill a bull
[615.72 - 621.68] oh wow this match is for losing
[618.56 - 624.72] I didn't want to win, that was the problem and
[621.68 - 626.60] I believe that bhaiya this match was that
[624.72 - 629.40] I see a lot of kids like me
[626.60 - 630.96] I am into sports or else he is in his 30s
[629.40 - 633.72] As we get closer we realise that we have done a lot
[630.96 - 636.36] I got injured, it's done, leave me alone now
[633.72 - 638.36] I am just saying that brother what is there in life
[636.36 - 640.00] I had already said that the match was mine against all of them
[638.36 - 642.52] it was for the children, it was for the youth whose
[640.00 - 644.16] There is a dream of sports in the eyes that in life
[642.52 - 646.40] no i think one thing that don't give up
[644.16 - 648.04] don't give up never give up yes I am one thing
[646.40 - 651.16] I think I always say one thing
[648.04 - 654.68] circumstances circumstances means a
[651.16 - 657.76] Situations are okay, situations are bad and people are not me
[654.68 - 660.84] only god can defeat me
[657.76 - 663.92] Hacky Difficult
[660.84 - 666.28] And Lord God I'm never coming down to this
[663.92 - 668.76] defeat you he love supporting and listen to me
[666.28 - 671.76] I know god, there is not much god up there but we
[668.76 - 673.36] He sees from here, we speak from above
[671.76 - 676.44] he looks from here he looks from there
[673.36 - 680.08] He is inside us, watching us
[676.44 - 682.68] from the place but I believe that when you are in the right
[680.08 - 684.52] If you are ethical then everyone supports you
[682.68 - 687.12] I do it and I never do it in my life
[684.52 - 689.84] I try very hard with hope
[687.12 - 692.32] Speaking of try to do good inside
[689.84 - 694.72] When he was a small child, what happened to the new children now?
[692.32 - 696.44] what happens in it is that whatever its speed would be
[694.72 - 698.64] which has stamina and is a little okay
[696.44 - 701.20] Although it is not the case that brother
[698.64 - 703.24] Your speed stamina will not be 50 at 40
[701.20 - 706.32] I will not do anything in 60 years
[703.24 - 708.08] If he makes an effort then it will happen and I will do the same
[706.32 - 710.48] I was watching him wrestle
[708.08 - 712.20] I was going to the point so I
[710.48 - 713.72] I was giving him two points, I was giving him one point
[712.20 - 716.72] I was scoring four
[713.72 - 720.52] I was scoring, I was doing all this, what else
[716.72 - 723.68] I was thinking that I would love this beautiful face game because
[720.52 - 725.36] wrestling is a gentleman's game remember me look at me
[723.68 - 727.68] Sushil Yogeshwar, we used to train at one place
[725.36 - 729.92] All three were together at Correct Chhatra Stadium
[727.68 - 731.56] I still remember when Sushil said this
[729.92 - 734.12] When Sushil won the medal, he left wrestling
[731.56 - 736.32] was made alive in 2008, corrected because
[734.12 - 738.08] Before that, modern wrestling was a bit down
[736.32 - 739.60] And then I was the first wrestler who
[738.08 - 742.16] The show brought back five stars from the arena
[739.60 - 745.28] I started doing it, then I started doing other things
[742.16 - 747.56] Now I am doing a film, you will laugh at me
[745.28 - 750.48] I did not know what a motivational speech was
[747.56 - 753.80] Today I am going to IIT IM from Awat
[750.48 - 756.16] I teach them I was that student who was 33
[753.80 - 758.72] But if the number comes then we think we have won the battle
[756.16 - 761.92] Bhaiya, and do you know what, I used to fail?
[758.72 - 763.52] yes so we can get the number of some other neighbor
[761.92 - 764.84] would write down the roll number after looking at it
[763.52 - 767.12] Because the family members were angry that day
[764.84 - 768.60] The person who gets beaten the most is my father.
[767.12 - 771.32] I still remember that once the results were about to come
[768.60 - 773.52] My next day we were going out
[771.32 - 775.24] He came and hit me with three or four shoes
[773.52 - 777.36] He used to take them out and wear shoes in the village
[775.24 - 779.20] One person asked why he was beating me with shoes and slippers
[777.36 - 782.84] You said brother its result will come tomorrow
[779.20 - 786.56] So I am I don't know, I will fight today
[782.84 - 789.40] Tomorrow sir will give advance payment
[786.56 - 791.48] When I go, my family members come and see me from there
[789.40 - 793.64] The teacher used to beat them in school
[791.48 - 795.84] I used to beat you but it is important to study
[793.64 - 797.56] Correct important I am telling you
[795.84 - 801.08] just coming to the same thing
[797.56 - 802.68] I am at home, my family members used to beat me, my neighbors used to beat me
[801.08 - 805.36] The teachers used to beat me in school and then my family members
[802.68 - 807.68] He used to beat me but till today I don't know why Bhaiya
[805.36 - 810.96] What is stress, what is anxiety, what is depression
[807.68 - 813.16] remember what it is look at education in school
[810.96 - 814.80] It is very important but what is the problem
[813.16 - 817.52] our education system is
[814.80 - 819.84] I will not tell you, he is there, I will teach you
[817.52 - 821.84] Triangle right angle hexagon crocodile which life what
[819.84 - 824.32] is that what it sets on those in schools
[821.84 - 827.08] right, they will teach you triangle, right angle, hexagon, which
[824.32 - 830.04] These are good meanings in one math
[827.08 - 831.48] make a triangle make this make that but what
[830.04 - 833.88] Nana you have a viewpoint on life
[831.48 - 836.44] Will you not teach? Yes, you can teach in schools.
[833.88 - 838.48] I want brother how to live life how can you
[836.44 - 840.84] Manage Your Finances How You Can Manage Your
[838.48 - 842.48] Relationships if this is not taught in schools
[840.84 - 844.56] Today's children are literate and will go ahead
[842.48 - 846.84] What is a literate person who has a degree
[844.56 - 849.16] We come here, we are educated, with values
[846.84 - 852.08] People grow up, even today someone big has stood up
[849.16 - 855.32] neither we will sit, I will live with everyone
[852.08 - 858.76] do I talk or do that and then
[855.32 - 861.92] What is that difference, that education is empty
[858.76 - 865.36] Reading doesn't make you a scholar
[861.92 - 867.88] You are here, you have got the degree, you can find a job
[865.36 - 870.76] What can I apply for?
[867.88 - 873.48] Actually a literate person is an educated person
[870.76 - 876.76] one who knows about values â€‹â€‹and
[873.48 - 878.60] There is an old saying that brother, everything is yours
[876.76 - 880.72] The idea of â€‹â€‹giving up is India
[878.60 - 884.40] this is Hindustan
[880.72 - 887.84] Values â€‹â€‹come to us from our parents since childhood
[884.40 - 890.40] correct so we learn this god is a little
[887.84 - 894.88] but parents guide us
[890.40 - 896.80] If yes then papa you don't need my shoe
[894.88 - 899.12] Whatever is mine, my mother has given me a lot
[896.80 - 901.56] I supported you, I had a disease called rheumatic
[899.12 - 904.04] atty i wanted to ask you about that how did
[901.56 - 908.20] you become a railler nor you have taken off this
[904.04 - 910.64] the world doesn't know this but what happens to my life
[908.20 - 913.64] The motivation is my rejection, wrestling
[910.64 - 916.20] I was rejected in a motivational speech
[913.64 - 918.28] rejected rejected on tv
[916.20 - 921.72] Now everyone has been rejected in the film Gaya
[918.28 - 924.20] I am doing the same work where I got rejection
[921.72 - 925.80] because that was what gave me a disease
[924.20 - 929.56] There used to be rheumatic arthritis i.e. Hindi
[925.80 - 931.00] I am talking about arthritis, arthritis, rheumatic
[929.56 - 934.00] I am telling everyone what happens on the other side
[931.00 - 935.84] I am sure that it is some food that we eat and
[934.00 - 938.00] He doesn't regret eating it, it's somewhere on the side
[935.84 - 941.00] If it happens then the food gets rotten again
[938.00 - 942.48] Gas is formed, then keep taking that medicine
[941.00 - 945.84] Nothing happens in this, in doctors' language
[942.48 - 947.60] The disease is not curable but 99.9% yes it is
[945.84 - 951.48] an auto immune disorder but i am saying
[947.60 - 954.04] I believe that this disease is curable at 200%
[951.48 - 955.96] Any disease like diabetes, BP, TB, cancer
[954.04 - 958.44] Joins arthritis is not a disease but life
[955.96 - 960.84] Style is a disease, it's life style, yes life
[958.44 - 963.36] This is style di thing if you read in Hindi
[960.84 - 965.80] What do you say about life style?
[963.36 - 967.24] You have a way of living, I say this
[965.80 - 970.08] yes that in hindi they say that bhaiya this
[967.24 - 973.36] It is all a disease, isn't it? These are the daily problems that you face
[970.08 - 976.80] Routine is his illness, daily i.e. every
[973.36 - 978.72] the daily life, the routine that you live
[976.80 - 981.12] There is no schedule, there is no discipline
[978.72 - 982.76] hey that is missing in these people look at many
[981.12 - 985.12] Do you know what you will eat these days?
[982.76 - 987.12] Everyone will say this very special thing
[985.12 - 989.48] I am telling you that you should eat less in 2R
[987.12 - 992.12] It becomes necessary to eat a small meal in the morning
[989.48 - 993.76] I want to tell you something, this is body, isn't it?
[992.12 - 997.12] This happens according to nature and science
[993.76 - 999.96] It doesn't go according to plan but whatever happens nowadays
[997.12 - 1002.68] Nowadays, my friends who are young
[999.96 - 1005.04] friend whether he is a dietician or
[1002.68 - 1007.40] Like you, he is a very renowned nutritionist
[1005.04 - 1009.36] or is there a doctor who knows what he will say oh my god
[1007.40 - 1011.84] your your oh my god your metabolism this
[1009.36 - 1013.60] it will happen you eat this eat that if you have a
[1011.84 - 1015.32] I ate biscuits too, it was just as much
[1013.60 - 1017.48] The internal system will work that much faster
[1015.32 - 1019.72] You will be able to digest only that much which you make or did you eat flowers
[1017.48 - 1021.56] My coach says that you will also do the same amount of work
[1019.72 - 1023.32] I had to tell you that you want to become a goat or a lion
[1021.56 - 1025.80] I said I didnâ€™t understand, I said the complete goat
[1023.32 - 1028.92] She keeps talking all day, I keep doing it
[1025.80 - 1032.04] The lion kills its prey in a day or two
[1028.92 - 1034.28] He eats food, only then he will hunt, only then he will eat
[1032.04 - 1036.40] So, the one who keeps talking the whole day,
[1034.28 - 1038.24] He will do it for two-four days and then it will be fine
[1036.40 - 1041.16] Do you know that someone will get some disease or the other?
[1038.24 - 1044.20] The body will do as much work as is eaten at one time
[1041.16 - 1047.36] This will be the one who eats twice a day, who will suffer three times a day
[1044.20 - 1049.80] The patient will eat three times a day
[1047.36 - 1051.36] so patient yes remember look these two
[1049.80 - 1054.08] I am telling this to everyone who has hours
[1051.36 - 1055.80] You eat in two hours, that is totally wrong
[1054.08 - 1058.40] I am saying this and I always give a mantra to everyone
[1055.80 - 1062.80] I will give it to you all as well, brother, food
[1058.40 - 1065.44] Hunger Less Water Double Workout Triple And
[1062.80 - 1068.20] Laugh, you have become four times fit, this is a struggle
[1065.44 - 1071.88] This is Singh's signature statement and today
[1068.20 - 1074.44] I got it so that's why I am saying that I need to eat it
[1071.88 - 1077.16] There was a meal in it
[1074.44 - 1079.88] to live, not to live to eat
[1077.16 - 1082.16] It happens that many will say that like a brother
[1079.88 - 1084.20] I am a vegetarian, I am not a vegan
[1082.16 - 1086.76] I would say brother eating non veg is different or
[1084.20 - 1090.64] It's different, but I believe this
[1086.76 - 1092.92] as much as your body needs
[1090.64 - 1094.80] eat only if you eat extra you will eat extra
[1092.92 - 1098.44] will you go to the toilet will you go to the bathroom
[1094.80 - 1100.12] What is the benefit of each vine now?
[1098.44 - 1102.48] You put some fodder in front of you and any animal can take it
[1100.12 - 1104.24] Come, you put some fodder, he will eat as much as he needs
[1102.48 - 1106.20] He is hungry, put food in front of him
[1104.24 - 1108.84] First he will eat it, he will eat it, then he will tie it up
[1106.20 - 1111.48] will take you to the doctor then
[1108.84 - 1113.80] Tell me, is that animal wiser or are we?
[1111.48 - 1116.96] Animals are more intelligent than us, where are humans
[1113.80 - 1118.80] He is intelligent, then he will talk big and
[1116.96 - 1122.32] I always say one thing, remember that
[1118.80 - 1126.00] You should protect your body more than your money
[1122.32 - 1128.56] We should because look if the body has deteriorated
[1126.00 - 1131.36] Then money will not be able to handle him and
[1128.56 - 1135.12] If your body is fine, then you can take care of your money,
[1131.36 - 1137.88] It is your body, you should take care of it every time
[1135.12 - 1140.36] Do more than one thing and say a lot
[1137.88 - 1141.84] Now you ask me who is your friend?
[1140.36 - 1144.40] I said brother is a friend for whom I have a lot of
[1141.84 - 1146.08] I do some work, that's me
[1144.40 - 1148.84] bolete i am there for you i am there for you
[1146.08 - 1150.16] I am there for you, you will laugh, some person is fit
[1148.84 - 1152.68] it wouldn't have happened
[1150.16 - 1154.96] I don't work with him physically or mentally
[1152.68 - 1157.48] I would have destroyed myself or someone would have done that
[1154.96 - 1162.76] If I work then it will cause more damage i.e.
[1157.48 - 1164.60] Remember that your friendship is yours to stay
[1162.76 - 1166.12] Your style is your eating style and your doing
[1164.60 - 1168.72] what should be the style of your
[1166.12 - 1171.44] become a friend then you can be friend of yours
[1168.72 - 1173.36] Family Your Wife Your Friend Your Everything
[1171.44 - 1175.56] Many say no, yes I will do it and
[1173.36 - 1178.32] Many say I am a party animal
[1175.56 - 1179.92] I'm a party animal, I'll do it anyway
[1178.32 - 1181.56] They are party animals, aren't they? They are owls
[1179.92 - 1183.36] What is an owl? It stays awake all night and day
[1181.56 - 1185.36] I keep sleeping in ya party animal na
[1183.36 - 1187.56] One becomes less mobile after 40

[1187.56 - 1192.68] I have to eat it at 9:00 o'clock then
[1189.52 - 1194.72] He is a party animal, slowly he
[1192.68 - 1197.68] become a party patient permanently
[1194.72 - 1199.92] party patients then all of them
[1197.68 - 1202.44] They meet again and get that test done
[1199.92 - 1205.68] You are right, your body is yours
[1202.44 - 1208.68] First True Life Partner a Japanese company

[1232.20 - 1238.20] Keep it, the one who has given the beak will definitely give the food
[1235.12 - 1240.36] The one who gave yesterday will make arrangements for tomorrow
[1238.20 - 1243.96] and the cheat particle and the hand feel somewhere
[1240.36 - 1246.76] it is available so we have to work on
[1243.96 - 1250.16] Becoming the Most Expensive Thought Process
[1246.76 - 1253.08] Firstly what I am saying is that as we
[1250.16 - 1255.16] we become what we think and I am one thing
[1253.08 - 1256.96] I always say that life is not what it seems
[1255.16 - 1259.88] The life we â€‹â€‹get is what we make it
[1256.96 - 1262.48] are the kids watching sangram and the
[1259.88 - 1266.20] Teenagers watching a video game
[1262.48 - 1266.20] plays or this
[1277.44 - 1281.96] netfx3
[1279.28 - 1283.72] Karos, I tell you I am also an Arunachal
[1281.96 - 1286.32] I was going to the state earlier also, I had
[1283.72 - 1288.20] I told you this is me, a 6 year old kid reading a book
[1286.32 - 1290.92] He was reading it while sitting next to me on the flight
[1288.20 - 1292.64] I was very impressed that a 6 year old
[1290.92 - 1296.40] The child is reading a book or else this is a game
[1292.64 - 1299.00] When he plays with his mobile, his mother comes
[1296.40 - 1301.96] I said, wow, what values â€‹â€‹you have given me
[1299.00 - 1304.56] She said brother, I have no sanskar
[1301.96 - 1306.84] these kids do what we do
[1304.56 - 1309.52] Isn't it the same thing that we do after seeing and learning from it?
[1306.84 - 1311.20] Parent should lead by example parent if
[1309.52 - 1312.84] They say if we are reading a book then
[1311.20 - 1314.52] will he read the book if we use mobile
[1312.84 - 1317.84] If he uses his mobile, we will fight
[1314.52 - 1320.56] Will Sangram Singh lead by wise words
[1317.84 - 1322.88] The example is of mummy and daddy leading
[1320.56 - 1325.76] Mummy and Daddy should be led by their surroundings
[1322.88 - 1328.92] all that's left to do is nothing else
[1325.76 - 1330.80] Many people say, look, nowadays I know this
[1328.92 - 1333.80] Is there any difference between my words and actions in my life
[1330.80 - 1336.40] there is no difference sorry please say that again my
[1333.80 - 1339.16] in life what ever i speak then i do
[1336.40 - 1342.56] what I do then I say this is not bhaiya
[1339.16 - 1344.76] I will do something big big talk but
[1342.56 - 1347.24] I will do nothing what ever I will do then
[1344.76 - 1349.48] I will speak what I will speak then I will
[1347.24 - 1351.40] doo waa once upon a time there was a time that my
[1349.48 - 1354.24] I used to have Rs 920 in my account and I got Rs 2.5 crore
[1351.40 - 1355.68] had you left the cold drink, what are you talking about
[1354.24 - 1358.40] I don't drink cold drinks so I
[1355.68 - 1361.56] I left and there was no money left, there was 0 in the account
[1358.40 - 1364.04] You will be surprised after reading the article so what
[1361.56 - 1365.96] Was the motivation de Sangram my motivation
[1364.04 - 1368.28] This is that by clenching fists in life
[1365.96 - 1370.60] I have to come with an open fist and go, take something with you
[1368.28 - 1374.12] I can go, I don't have anything of my own
[1370.60 - 1376.80] Tell me, this mother-in-law is not even yours when
[1374.12 - 1379.12] When I leave, another one comes, many of them are in this
[1376.80 - 1380.96] They remain confused whether they have earned money or not
[1379.12 - 1382.20] I have earned it, I am earning as much money as I am earning now
[1380.96 - 1384.64] earning for a man like me
[1382.20 - 1387.88] Will you keep us as brand ambassador or do something?
[1384.64 - 1390.56] no how important is breath i say
[1387.88 - 1392.08] if the most important thing in life is
[1390.56 - 1395.24] If I have any disease, I will cure four things
[1392.08 - 1397.88] I make him drink water from his breath
[1395.24 - 1399.28] from eating position and sleeping position
[1397.88 - 1402.80] Position
[1399.28 - 1405.52] If you have any disease due to these four things
[1402.80 - 1408.04] it gets healed well we who are
[1405.52 - 1411.56] The healing of the child within the healing
[1408.04 - 1416.16] So that was the mom and the kid was studying.
[1411.56 - 1420.08] yes so that means parent should lead
[1416.16 - 1423.68] Parents should lead and remember the teacher
[1420.08 - 1427.80] Teacher and mother child are the most important
[1423.68 - 1431.36] If in their womb the correct
[1427.80 - 1433.36] Neither creation happens nor destruction occurs
[1431.36 - 1437.28] construction means making something
[1433.36 - 1439.76] Parle means destruction of what if the mother
[1437.28 - 1443.00] and teacher teacher parents and teacher if
[1439.76 - 1445.00] If everything is right then your life is right, otherwise
[1443.00 - 1447.52] If he turns out to be a little bad, now
[1445.00 - 1449.72] Tell me, each doctor turned out to be bad, come on
[1447.52 - 1452.40] There is a doctor in life, one doctor turned out to be bad
[1449.72 - 1454.68] So what if it's 50 tastes good in a hurry
[1452.40 - 1457.40] It will take you to places where you don't want to go
[1454.68 - 1459.44] The engine went bad what will happen 500 700 a
[1457.40 - 1462.80] The bridge was made wrongly, it will cost Rs 500 to take it up
[1459.44 - 1465.84] will go but a teacher and a mother father are wrong
[1462.80 - 1468.04] If he leaves then he is not from one country
[1465.84 - 1469.88] Anyone who goes ahead will ruin the future
[1468.04 - 1472.88] Now I could be telling the kids
[1469.88 - 1475.52] Everyone, if you stray from your path
[1472.88 - 1477.84] So you don't just harm yourself you harm the country
[1475.52 - 1481.60] You are an asset for the country
[1477.84 - 1484.20] You could have been or you could be, time is very powerful
[1481.60 - 1488.60] I always say one thing, time is very
[1484.20 - 1490.24] Powerful times are very strong brother today
[1488.60 - 1493.88] I don't have a passport, I'll never fly an airplane
[1490.24 - 1496.60] used to travel and so did those driving cars worth 90 lakhs
[1493.88 - 1499.00] If you go to Haridwar in a pot of 90
[1496.60 - 1501.76] Therefore explain to the children that your son
[1499.00 - 1503.68] The aim of life should be that of schools
[1501.76 - 1507.08] I should teach it to the children
[1503.68 - 1509.56] how we can be happy in this life
[1507.08 - 1511.40] The biggest thing is happiness is the
[1509.56 - 1515.08] This is the highest form of success for the child
[1511.40 - 1517.32] I should explain also I think one more thing
[1515.08 - 1518.84] is what is your thing about respecting
[1517.32 - 1522.64] The
[1518.84 - 1525.96] Today's kids respect their teachers
[1522.64 - 1531.08] I see I have my own child
[1525.96 - 1534.52] He was 11 years old and had tuition, so ma'am came.
[1531.08 - 1537.04] good evening icon yes if I say so then I
[1534.52 - 1539.52] I got very angry and went inside the room
[1537.04 - 1543.64] can please say good evening to mam she is yours
[1539.52 - 1547.00] teacher so what is your advice from to
[1543.64 - 1550.00] Manners of a 20 year old to 30 year old or
[1547.00 - 1552.92] Respect how important as a wrestler you are
[1550.00 - 1556.60] Are you in this arena? There is no place in this world
[1552.92 - 1559.48] People raise their children at 98, okay?
[1556.60 - 1562.20] Parvesh is raised for just 2 rupees
[1559.48 - 1565.52] What does it mean to be brought up with values
[1562.20 - 1568.84] with which we each in the right way in the right way
[1565.52 - 1570.52] she has grown up so much that we know the rest
[1568.84 - 1572.88] What do you think? It's ok, I got the tuition done.
[1570.52 - 1576.28] I did it, didn't I do it, everyone should think
[1572.88 - 1580.80] Brother, teach that child moral values
[1576.28 - 1584.08] Values â€‹â€‹that Bhaiya how to respect others how
[1580.80 - 1585.64] How to React and Manage Everything from 2 Years Ago
[1584.08 - 1587.88] If you teach the child that brother this
[1585.64 - 1590.24] Life is like we were kids
[1587.88 - 1592.36] Aunty used to take me to the temple
[1590.24 - 1594.36] I would fold my hands and something else would come up
[1592.36 - 1597.00] I would have done this, the third thing that came up was this
[1594.36 - 1599.32] I used to do this, my mother used to teach me that by doing this
[1597.00 - 1601.60] This means that you will get a fever in your own way
[1599.32 - 1604.08] He used to teach me because he was in a school
[1601.60 - 1606.76] I did not study but whatever education I got from my mother
[1604.08 - 1608.88] He should learn more from his father than from his teacher
[1606.76 - 1611.36] many are not educated and have not gone to school
[1608.88 - 1613.28] Today I travel the world wide in pursuit of such education.
[1611.36 - 1615.96] How did you not learn such lessons
[1613.28 - 1617.40] If you are teaching children from a young age, then
[1615.96 - 1620.28] You are making me grow up, teach me slowly
[1617.40 - 1623.40] If you are staying then they learn and one by one
[1620.28 - 1625.32] There is a saying that no matter what you do
[1623.40 - 1628.04] The child who will be yours will not be yours
[1625.32 - 1629.68] He will learn that home grown chicken is equal to dal, yes home grown
[1628.04 - 1632.56] Jogi is not an outside yogi but a home made yogi
[1629.68 - 1634.68] He will think that it is okay friend
[1632.56 - 1636.08] Now tell me yourself who were the big actors
[1634.68 - 1638.76] His sons were great sports persons
[1636.08 - 1641.52] I couldn't make it, I couldn't make it
[1638.76 - 1644.68] because that thing comes out of a house
[1641.52 - 1646.24] And remember that what is a passion is
[1644.68 - 1649.40] A fire occurs
[1646.24 - 1652.84] We are saying that wealth and prosperity is a very good thing
[1649.40 - 1655.92] Wealth and glory do not mean that brother, if he
[1652.84 - 1662.08] If you are a Yogi then your life is successful
[1655.92 - 1664.28] or one who is a man of valour or a beggar
[1662.08 - 1667.08] He himself works hard
[1664.28 - 1669.96] Then only he achieves purushaarth i.e. Patrika
[1667.08 - 1673.00] property, that is, property left behind or given to someone
[1669.96 - 1676.16] Keeping an eye on other's property or stealing
[1673.00 - 1677.88] If you get a chance then Yogi is a bandit if you
[1676.16 - 1679.44] Leave more assets for your children
[1677.88 - 1683.80] If you are doing that then you are ruining their life
[1679.44 - 1685.84] I think Bill Gates doesn't leave much wealth
[1683.80 - 1689.04] to his children if you have
[1685.84 - 1691.76] Teach him not to leave you, teach him values
[1689.04 - 1693.36] he should have the ability to read and eat if
[1691.76 - 1695.76] If my father had money then I would have been here
[1693.36 - 1697.68] I come a little, I stay comfortably there
[1695.76 - 1699.48] I would go to discos, I would drive around
[1697.68 - 1700.52] I would have neither done sports nor anything else
[1699.48 - 1703.84] in things
[1700.52 - 1706.20] I am speaking of sports because you said
[1703.84 - 1709.44] you have rheumatoid arthritis
[1706.20 - 1710.32] What was the logic of getting in to wrestling
[1709.44 - 1713.44] End
[1710.32 - 1716.84] wrestling that how did it reach there that mom
[1713.44 - 1719.68] Was it daddy's thought or my own thought, how was it
[1716.84 - 1721.80] Now look I am from Haryana, yes Haryana
[1719.68 - 1724.32] what is it that wrestling is very famous yes it
[1721.80 - 1727.12] is like means gold medal in the family there
[1724.32 - 1729.16] should be a wrestler now i will tell you why when
[1727.12 - 1731.08] When I was young what used to happen was that so many
[1729.16 - 1734.08] If there was no money, the cricket bat would cost Rs 30
[1731.08 - 1737.32] We were not badminton and tennis players in our 40s
[1734.08 - 1739.72] Even today tennis Venice is less we are loincloth
[1737.32 - 1743.80] I used to get Rs. Sometimes my mother sealed it, sometimes my sister did.
[1739.72 - 1745.60] I have sealed it so let's wrestle once
[1743.80 - 1748.80] We do not wrestle to win any medal
[1745.60 - 1750.92] Remember, only a person who wrestles becomes a player
[1748.80 - 1753.00] who comes from a very poor home
[1750.92 - 1754.72] I come from a very different family background
[1753.00 - 1756.44] I have come from a village once
[1754.72 - 1759.16] I saw mud wrestling where the wrestlers were given ghee
[1756.44 - 1761.16] Getting milk, getting money for food
[1759.16 - 1763.40] The thing I said was, I wish I was a wrestler
[1761.16 - 1768.60] There was a lot of respect, one of them was wrestling
[1763.40 - 1770.92] When he came back victorious, he would come to the whole area and village
[1768.60 - 1773.52] I wish I had respect for him, my friend
[1770.92 - 1776.88] wrestler is actually wrestler and it is
[1773.52 - 1778.64] Like a title correct wrestler means I
[1776.88 - 1780.60] I will tell you, others would think so today the media
[1778.64 - 1782.64] People even changed the language of the wrestler
[1780.60 - 1785.84] He says call two wrestlers to have a fight
[1782.64 - 1790.00] If you call a wrestler, he will first call you
[1785.84 - 1792.80] means in every thing which a human being physically
[1790.00 - 1795.72] mentally disciplined first
[1792.80 - 1798.48] wrestler hai who is the person who is mentally
[1795.72 - 1802.08] Physical discipline first and foremost is his wrestler himself
[1798.48 - 1804.12] she is wrestler its very true wrestler is such
[1802.08 - 1806.36] Wrestling is such a sport
[1804.12 - 1809.36] It's a sport in which no one pays to teach
[1806.36 - 1812.40] does not take it and all those who are junior
[1809.36 - 1815.04] We will touch your feet, our seniors' feet
[1812.40 - 1817.24] I will work for them, they have no answer
[1815.04 - 1818.96] I have only seen him in wrestling
[1817.24 - 1822.40] In other sports I have said this is very
[1818.96 - 1825.80] true actually sangram because i am one with n
[1822.40 - 1828.52] Olympic Medalist in Wrestling and Now An
[1825.80 - 1830.96] I analyze it as a sports nutrition
[1828.52 - 1834.60] I watch the rest of the sports which
[1830.96 - 1835.88] The only value system is wrestling and karate
[1834.60 - 1840.28] inside the
[1835.88 - 1843.40] which is the traditional system which
[1840.28 - 1847.12] There is respect and you don't question it
[1843.40 - 1848.56] your guru till you become a guru not you are guru
[1847.12 - 1851.12] Even after becoming one you do not question him
[1848.56 - 1853.12] You will do it today as well, like I go to the village
[1851.12 - 1855.64] There was a Pandit Sat Maharaj who taught wrestling
[1853.12 - 1858.96] got it started ok he did not get married
[1855.64 - 1860.44] He used to say that he had given his all for us
[1858.96 - 1863.92] I don't want you to be a wrestler or anything
[1860.44 - 1866.44] do it in hindi br celibate yes celibate
[1863.92 - 1868.04] He devoted his life and knew
[1866.44 - 1870.20] what did you say that I don't want you to
[1868.04 - 1873.08] I want one of these to become a restaurant
[1870.20 - 1875.16] All of you should be healthy and stay away from bad habits
[1873.08 - 1877.44] If you are saved from bad habits, then your children
[1875.16 - 1880.16] They became strong and then their children became strong
[1877.44 - 1883.60] If we go, society will change, state will change, country will change
[1880.16 - 1887.68] That person's thinking will change, it was something unique
[1883.60 - 1890.80] So it's wrestling, wrestling match from today
[1887.68 - 1893.32] No, Krishna Bheem is from ancient times, Krishna ji was Bheem
[1890.80 - 1895.92] Yes, he used to wrestle, he used to do wrestling
[1893.32 - 1898.84] And when did the Olympics start in 1816?
[1895.92 - 1903.28] There were five games in Athens, only
[1898.84 - 1905.40] Bull race wrestling is one of those escapes
[1903.28 - 1908.60] So this happened in three, four or five games.
[1905.40 - 1911.28] Wrestling is a very old sport and look at wrestling
[1908.60 - 1913.04] India started it and we India
[1911.28 - 1915.64] India had lagged far behind in wrestling
[1913.04 - 1917.52] There are still new kids in wrestling who
[1915.64 - 1921.20] They are doing something like Jadhav sahab got a medal
[1917.52 - 1923.08] This game is very easy if you win or do anything else
[1921.20 - 1926.04] old as i am about karate
[1923.08 - 1930.04] I don't know it so deep but I
[1926.04 - 1931.80] Respect all sports but nowadays I
[1930.04 - 1933.88] I feel scared seeing the players, brother
[1931.80 - 1937.00] because they are misguided that
[1933.88 - 1939.72] Brother should you take this steroid or injection
[1937.00 - 1942.56] Apply or eat this thing, this performance will improve
[1939.72 - 1945.00] speaking makes him a robot
[1942.56 - 1947.52] of this sis yav come to this a lot of audience
[1945.00 - 1949.64] Will want to know how powerful is Sangram
[1947.52 - 1952.40] If you could, you would have gone inside the steroids
[1949.64 - 1954.72] How Important Is It in Supplements
[1952.40 - 1956.52] I am powerful because I am 40 years or above
[1954.72 - 1960.44] I can still wrestle, do everything
[1956.52 - 1964.44] I am here brother, I drink milk and ghee
[1960.44 - 1966.52] I eat rotis, I eat millet
[1964.44 - 1968.72] So nowadays it is happening to get milt, eat milt
[1966.52 - 1970.64] I eat rice, I eat dal, everything
[1968.72 - 1973.64] I eat jaggery, I eat sugar candy
[1970.64 - 1976.20] I eat honey I used to drink 10 liters of milk every day
[1973.64 - 1977.84] 10 liters of milk every day which is the sermon of many people these days
[1976.20 - 1979.80] They tell me that I should not drink milk
[1977.84 - 1981.92] This happens by drinking milk, hey brother
[1979.80 - 1984.92] According to the glory of India
[1981.92 - 1986.80] So you should drink milk, eat ghee and eat rotis
[1984.92 - 1989.12] Bread is a very powerful thing that can
[1986.80 - 1990.80] They say that I have given up on diet
[1989.12 - 1992.92] hmm hey you won't eat dinner like that
[1990.80 - 1996.56] You will fall dizzy my friend so I have the strength
[1992.92 - 2000.12] The secret of my strength is ghee every day, brother
[1996.56 - 2001.96] I eat milk and still drink one litre of milk
[2000.12 - 2004.68] Earlier I used to drink 10 liters, now my weight has increased a bit
[2001.96 - 2007.28] If I lower it, I lower it a little cow
[2004.68 - 2009.16] Which cow or buffalo should I get? Which buffalo should I get?
[2007.28 - 2011.56] It would be good if I could get milk here
[2009.16 - 2014.56] I get my milk from Nashik and Pune
[2011.56 - 2017.44] Every day it comes like this so I drink ghee
[2014.56 - 2019.92] If someone comes from a village then he cannot be considered powerful
[2017.44 - 2022.20] And if it has to last a long time then I am saying
[2019.92 - 2026.28] that brother which is your traditional food if
[2022.20 - 2029.40] You are from your roots, if your roots are strong
[2026.28 - 2031.88] It will be so if the foundation is strong
[2029.40 - 2033.76] If yes, then make a big building
[2031.88 - 2036.28] If the foundation is weak even a garland may fall
[2033.76 - 2038.76] One of your floors will collapse from its roots
[2036.28 - 2040.88] If you stay connected or not you will disconnect then you will be
[2038.76 - 2044.28] of my strength
[2040.88 - 2047.76] Raj milk ghee all these things, lots of them
[2044.28 - 2049.52] He preaches that nowadays there are many animal lovers too
[2047.76 - 2052.24] I respect you because I'm from Puffy
[2049.52 - 2055.52] I am associated with People for Animals.
[2052.24 - 2057.52] If you make a face then everything is fine but remember
[2055.52 - 2059.56] that if you live in India and you want to breastfeed your child
[2057.52 - 2061.44] you don't feed me ghee and you don't feed me
[2059.56 - 2063.60] If you don't feed rotis to that child then you
[2061.44 - 2065.88] Brother, there cannot be any strength in that, you should get it written
[2063.60 - 2068.28] that you take that strength from me, right?
[2065.88 - 2070.60] His strength will last for two to five years, then
[2068.28 - 2073.08] Other diseases will start appearing in the body
[2070.60 - 2075.76] The third disease will come, I will come even today
[2073.08 - 2078.00] I eat full food, do full things
[2075.76 - 2080.76] I work out I can't even take a step
[2078.00 - 2083.64] I was sick and I was tired today
[2080.76 - 2085.68] Stamina is my strength, my fitness is my
[2083.64 - 2087.52] there is strength i have never gone on this what what
[2085.68 - 2093.40] is this fat percentage is this percentage
[2087.52 - 2095.56] And remember the percentage of the body and this world
[2093.40 - 2097.36] They are just watching your presentation now.
[2095.56 - 2099.72] Many say that they have six packs and zero
[2097.36 - 2102.36] cy and he did it and he made it fit
[2099.72 - 2104.16] she is not fit to be seen falling down the wall
[2102.36 - 2106.44] If you dim the light on this then the wall
[2104.16 - 2110.08] no no it will fall down two way problem
[2106.44 - 2111.60] go muscle or show muscle only if you go muscle
[2110.08 - 2113.52] If you work hard the show will happen on its own
[2111.60 - 2116.64] It will be corrected but from today you people
[2113.52 - 2118.32] go to the top of the show want shortcut
[2116.64 - 2119.96] If you go there, it is wrong, then you know what
[2118.32 - 2123.68] In a few days, he will become very ill
[2119.96 - 2127.20] don't eat this protein, eat that protein yourself now
[2123.68 - 2130.72] Tell me Run Bhai, you have 50 lakhs a month right?
[2127.20 - 2132.44] And if you are earning then suppose I am earning 50 lakhs
[2130.72 - 2134.76] I will give you more than a crore then you can do the work
[2132.44 - 2136.44] you will not do it, you will sit comfortably
[2134.76 - 2138.36] Because you were earning 50 lakhs and I was earning crores
[2136.44 - 2140.64] I have given you more than that then you can relax
[2138.36 - 2142.56] will you do that ok i got more
[2140.64 - 2144.00] This is what I tell my young friends
[2142.56 - 2146.04] I want that brother if you in my body
[2144.00 - 2148.44] You will add protein, you will add other things, I say
[2146.04 - 2150.72] It is not harmful but it is a natural protein
[2148.44 - 2152.72] Banana is a natural thing in your body
[2150.72 - 2156.72] She will leave you, she will stop working
[2152.72 - 2160.28] You will fall ill but natural is the best
[2156.72 - 2163.40] Whatever you eat, drink it with milk or ghee
[2160.28 - 2166.24] You eat salad, you eat fruits, seasonal fruits
[2163.40 - 2168.36] Eat seasonal vegetables Eat seasonal grains
[2166.24 - 2170.64] If we get it then it is a wonderful thing, otherwise we
[2168.36 - 2173.24] So we grew up eating wheat and then we grew up eating wheat
[2170.64 - 2176.28] I have grown up and most of all I always remember one thing
[2173.24 - 2179.68] I tell everyone no matter how much one talks
[2176.28 - 2182.24] Most multi vitamin protein high most
[2179.68 - 2184.68] nice food do you know what it is you are happy
[2182.24 - 2188.40] No, eat dry bread and onion, I am telling you
[2184.68 - 2191.12] I am more professional than him
[2188.40 - 2192.88] There isn't much complete rich food and you
[2191.12 - 2195.12] If you are sad or angry, eat anything
[2192.88 - 2196.84] My body won't feel happy anymore
[2195.12 - 2198.56] You brought coconut water, many will say that
[2196.84 - 2201.00] Well, the coconut water was kept for a while, then
[2198.56 - 2202.76] Do not drink it, it will get spoiled, yes it will get spoiled
[2201.00 - 2204.16] It will happen if my mind accepts that
[2202.76 - 2207.88] ok then its ok then
[2204.16 - 2209.44] so remember not to go too far
[2207.88 - 2211.60] If you would have read too much into things then
[2209.44 - 2213.92] There will be many such wise people, now who knows
[2211.60 - 2216.48] Who gives knowledge of milk and ghee?
[2213.92 - 2218.12] He never used it twice in his life
[2216.48 - 2220.84] Mari will say that by doing dips your hands will not work
[2218.12 - 2222.88] Your body will deteriorate
[2220.84 - 2226.48] I used to do 1200-1500 dips.
[2222.88 - 2228.76] constantly keep your hand constantly keep your hand behind the coach
[2226.48 - 2231.28] Or brother would have stood with a stick, I would have seen this
[2228.76 - 2234.40] 1200 1500 I have hit continuously from deep with such hands
[2231.28 - 2236.16] keep it, people talk a lot these days 50 maar
[2234.40 - 2238.56] Okay, I am going towards that, go towards that
[2236.16 - 2241.16] I am doing okay, technology has grown up
[2238.56 - 2243.64] Things have become bigger but remember the foundation
[2241.16 - 2245.00] you are strong so we are talking about
[2243.64 - 2249.48] Foundation End
[2245.00 - 2253.80] Everything is a meal that I remember from my childhood
[2249.48 - 2256.96] That's yours, you said 1000 pushups.
[2253.80 - 2259.44] I am not 1000 I am 1200 1500 1700
[2256.96 - 2262.72] I used to give it to you and I still remember that one time
[2259.44 - 2266.32] It was Diwali day yes but not Domes
[2262.72 - 2268.64] tha muscle soness something like this is gonna happen and ya too
[2266.32 - 2271.68] Well after that I used to hit him everyday and applied oil
[2268.64 - 2275.72] Tie a loincloth on the body, keep hands on it and hit like this
[2271.68 - 2281.68] once upon a time what was this
[2275.72 - 2285.20] 20 20 20 23 18 20 22 25 it was like this and once
[2281.68 - 2287.44] Do you know what would have happened if we had gotten fruits then?
[2285.20 - 2289.40] If there is good food then there is a relative in the house
[2287.44 - 2291.28] if I didn't come I would have got fruit because we
[2289.40 - 2293.28] You were not from such a family that you could not even imagine
[2291.28 - 2294.92] It is very expensive, I didn't have anything
[2293.28 - 2296.84] Because we come from a very basic family
[2294.92 - 2299.44] There was some relationship at home, I would get sweets that day
[2296.84 - 2300.72] I was drenched in ghee, I have come here knowingly
[2299.44 - 2303.12] I used to sit down and eat some food here
[2300.72 - 2305.24] I will take it only when I leave it or I will get biscuits only then
[2303.12 - 2308.88] Food was available then, some fruits once a day
[2305.24 - 2312.36] I said, I will give you six bananas, Deepa later I will give you six bananas
[2308.88 - 2316.72] The condition is six bananas i.e. half a dozen or half
[2312.36 - 2320.12] I had given him 1300 blows on that dozen
[2316.72 - 2322.56] On the day of Deepawali, there are six bananas on it
[2320.12 - 2326.68] I killed 1300 rupees and we told each one of them
[2322.56 - 2329.72] that in two days he earned Rs 2800 and Rs 800
[2326.68 - 2331.72] The boy made this bet on our bananas
[2329.72 - 2335.32] There used to be so much beating, earlier it used to be regular
[2331.72 - 2338.36] That's so true, know what happens to today's children
[2335.32 - 2341.76] went to get everything
[2338.36 - 2344.28] so they don't have that target inside of them
[2341.76 - 2349.00] that I can make something so some times
[2344.28 - 2352.24] when you come from a background watch your food
[2349.00 - 2355.12] can give you a lot of power you are looking at that
[2352.24 - 2357.96] bro i should make half dozen
[2355.12 - 2360.20] I have to do something today, kids, what will I do?
[2357.96 - 2362.20] They say sir what are you giving me
[2360.20 - 2364.68] I want junk food I want pizza
[2362.20 - 2366.88] I want a burger what is yours
[2364.68 - 2368.80] Advice on junk food, now I am telling you the right thing
[2366.88 - 2372.04] Look, remember the junk food you eat
[2368.80 - 2374.32] No, that means you are eating poison, sorry
[2372.04 - 2375.92] But today's kids mean this now look at me
[2374.32 - 2378.52] I am telling everyone the parents of today's children
[2375.92 - 2381.36] I hope son, it would be better if you drink lemon water
[2378.52 - 2383.52] Better you drink coconut water than this
[2381.36 - 2386.96] You can eat anything like pizza or burger
[2383.52 - 2388.76] This is all there is, aren't you? Try chewing on it
[2386.96 - 2390.12] The food which is tasty is not healthy
[2388.76 - 2392.76] Whatever is healthy will not be tasty
[2390.12 - 2395.20] This is true when you chew junk food
[2392.76 - 2398.44] If you do, it will become tasteless after a while.
[2395.20 - 2400.84] and you start chewing dry bread
[2398.44 - 2402.28] It's going to take some time for that resin to come out
[2400.84 - 2404.96] The sweet feeling will start
[2402.28 - 2406.44] If you go then look at the junk food brother, the day you
[2404.96 - 2408.52] If you get angry, punish yourself
[2406.44 - 2410.20] Ofcourse you should eat junk food and drink cold drinks
[2408.52 - 2412.64] Many people add this, right?
[2410.20 - 2415.24] that the dogs drink cold drinks or do something
[2412.64 - 2416.48] brother, we do all that if you do it every day
[2415.24 - 2419.80] cold drinks cold drinks in my house
[2416.48 - 2421.44] When do you know when a stain does not come out or
[2419.80 - 2424.08] Or when the toilet needs to be cleaned at home
[2421.44 - 2427.96] There are a lot of stains on the floor that don't seem to come out
[2424.08 - 2429.76] No, we will not come inside your house, Bakul and this
[2427.96 - 2432.32] will it make a mess with toilet cleaner yes absolutely
[2429.76 - 2434.16] can I make it, I will tell you when
[2432.32 - 2436.76] I got an offer of so many crores in my account
[2434.16 - 2439.64] There were 920, so do you know what I told them?
[2436.76 - 2441.44] that bhaiya said that he has crores of fan following
[2439.64 - 2443.36] everything will happen, you will be such a big star
[2441.44 - 2445.52] You will become all this will happen, all that will happen and I
[2443.36 - 2447.04] I was staying at some house, I just said that
[2445.52 - 2450.60] Bhaiya, if you listen to it comfortably at night, then it will last the whole day
[2447.04 - 2451.88] You have to be honest and say the right thing and if you
[2450.60 - 2453.36] Kids are following me so I follow them
[2451.88 - 2455.40] I am making you drink poison, see I also made mistakes
[2453.36 - 2456.96] These are our only mistakes, earlier we were childish
[2455.40 - 2459.48] We used to lie, we used to make mistakes too
[2456.96 - 2463.32] I used to watch it too, ever since I became wiser
[2459.48 - 2465.44] Let's see, brother, that is my goal
[2463.32 - 2467.52] Being an actor is not just a sports person
[2465.44 - 2469.60] I don't want to become or I don't want to become motivated or
[2467.52 - 2473.20] Do you want to become a doctor in health or do you want to become a doctor in the inner world?
[2469.60 - 2477.28] It is not my goal to take my country forward
[2473.20 - 2480.76] We have to go with them and then the country will move ahead
[2477.28 - 2483.20] When the youth remains healthy and youth is one who
[2480.76 - 2485.28] It is the values â€‹â€‹that change the era
[2483.20 - 2488.00] If you want to see the strength of any country then
[2485.28 - 2490.48] Look at one thing, brother, how healthy he is.
[2488.00 - 2493.04] his sports is so advanced that's why I
[2490.48 - 2495.88] I don't look at my personal matters at all,
[2493.04 - 2498.32] I do everything thinking that brother, I am from somewhere
[2495.88 - 2500.56] If I bring a rupee then I will give you some work
[2498.32 - 2503.28] I don't do any work for money
[2500.56 - 2505.28] I do it for passion no matter what
[2503.28 - 2507.08] There is going to be a difference brother, I will drink water and then go to sleep
[2505.28 - 2510.68] I will go to sleep after eating roti with onion but every
[2507.08 - 2513.80] work for passion speaking of passion we
[2510.68 - 2516.28] you people are from haryana when you start eating

[2532.76 - 2537.36] Me look let me tell you once I
[2535.36 - 2540.92] I will tell you the incident when I met Payal ji for the first time
[2537.36 - 2544.52] When I went to meet him at his home I did not know
[2540.92 - 2548.12] I had taken two three dozen bananas, apples and
[2544.52 - 2550.44] Your lover took some mangoes, listen what?
[2548.12 - 2554.08] So listen, that means we go to the village like this
[2550.44 - 2556.28] was he Payal ji's brother or her mother
[2554.08 - 2558.64] She was his mother so still he is happy brother
[2556.28 - 2560.44] Who knows what everybody was thinking, that he was carrying flowers
[2558.64 - 2563.44] He will come and bring chocolates, whoever does all this
[2560.44 - 2566.24] no you took fruit root bananas like this
[2563.44 - 2568.60] If it happens normally then everybody sees it and that is all
[2566.24 - 2571.00] no meaning you kept making such a face as if
[2568.60 - 2573.08] I thought a little bit that I was feeling unwell
[2571.00 - 2575.92] Their condition has worsened, I remain normal
[2573.08 - 2578.52] I live like this only, so pa ji bo

[2578.52 - 2582.32] I said I did not understand, brother, what are you saying
[2580.48 - 2584.76] When you go to meet me, you bring good chocolates
[2582.32 - 2586.68] yes you bring all the good flowers
[2584.76 - 2588.96] Come let me see you eat chocolate in your body
[2586.68 - 2591.80] Mosquitoes will cause harm in Flor after two days
[2588.96 - 2593.64] You will start sitting, understand this, you will eat banana
[2591.80 - 2595.44] If you eat apples and mangoes, your body will gain strength
[2593.64 - 2599.28] some work
[2595.44 - 2600.48] If you do it then this is my basic structure and the rest of the house
[2599.28 - 2602.08] I didn't know what was happening for three days
[2600.48 - 2604.40] According to me it was calculated for three days
[2602.08 - 2608.12] Now food was prepared at home according to me
[2604.40 - 2610.64] It would be better if I taught them all this in yoga
[2608.12 - 2612.88] Eating this food is a part of healthy habits
[2610.64 - 2615.68] Now he should do more yoga than me
[2612.88 - 2618.24] He does more different asanas than me
[2615.68 - 2620.96] He is healthier than me in that
[2618.24 - 2624.24] so what happens in lots of things
[2620.96 - 2626.68] that you learn some things by observing and living with them
[2624.24 - 2628.96] now i sometimes have tea or coffee at my home
[2626.68 - 2630.56] He doesn't drink, so he drinks often
[2628.96 - 2632.04] because someone asks me if I would like to have tea
[2630.56 - 2634.48] Would you like some coffee, I am a little sick
[2632.04 - 2637.32] Bhaiya because tea is the work of very sick people

[2637.32 - 2642.52] drink coconut water drink chhat drink milk
[2640.80 - 2644.20] When I go to a hotel to drink coffee
[2642.52 - 2646.60] I don't know what I am saying, there is some milk in it
[2644.20 - 2649.84] Add turmeric and honey or give it to someone on the side
[2646.60 - 2651.88] They look at me like this, look we have turned the world upside down
[2649.84 - 2653.80] Someone has made it, now they will do dips here

[2682.32 - 2687.72] what is it we do upstairs and by staying hungry ourselves
[2685.76 - 2692.48] Feeding others and Indian culture
[2687.72 - 2694.36] wow pa then what is it about that let us go
[2692.48 - 2696.80] We are no more, we have become fools these days
[2694.36 - 2699.48] All children grow up with these values
[2696.80 - 2702.32] Is it in the name of studies or modern modernity
[2699.48 - 2704.80] I don't know what they are doing in the name of
[2702.32 - 2707.44] You will not be connected to the route nor will you move forward
[2704.80 - 2711.00] If you can't come then I was wrestling
[2707.44 - 2712.36] Either I won the wrestling or now I will do it again
[2711.00 - 2715.56] I might try another sport
[2712.36 - 2718.16] I should turn now at this age what is your age
[2715.56 - 2720.68] I have a number, I know someone is calling me
[2718.16 - 2723.24] do some work, we are working, I would say so much
[2720.68 - 2725.68] yes, after 100 years I have to do walking for 100 years
[2723.24 - 2727.72] Run and exercise till you reach 100
[2725.68 - 2730.24] has to be done after a year
[2727.72 - 2732.68] Do you understand that he doesn't accept any work out?
[2730.24 - 2734.04] I don't agree with that, do it with your body, you give me 100
[2732.68 - 2736.60] I can't walk for a kilometer
[2734.04 - 2738.48] I will keep running, I will keep walking lightly
[2736.60 - 2740.84] I can't even walk up any stairs
[2738.48 - 2743.00] I climb up to four floors like this
[2740.84 - 2745.36] I get down normally and sit in the balcony
[2743.00 - 2747.00] So my routine in life is like this
[2745.36 - 2748.96] It keeps going no matter what I look for
[2747.00 - 2751.44] Prime Minister sahab is a superstar
[2748.96 - 2754.60] I think that all rickshaw pullers are equal
[2751.44 - 2759.20] Brother, my country is great, so what is my contribution?
[2754.60 - 2762.68] We don't want anything from anybody so we are fighting
[2759.20 - 2765.16] I saw that values â€‹â€‹are very important
[2762.68 - 2769.00] Parents should give values â€‹â€‹to their children
[2765.16 - 2773.44] But the children should give it at the age of 18 years
[2769.00 - 2777.16] Become an adult right to vote right to
[2773.44 - 2780.60] drive but I saw that those who voted
[2777.16 - 2784.68] you are not even registering so what
[2780.60 - 2789.04] is your advice to the youngsters from 18 to
[2784.68 - 2792.80] 30 Why is it Important Young Democracy
[2789.04 - 2795.68] To vote and register and be vocal not like this
[2792.80 - 2798.64] to say hey bye my vote does not
[2795.68 - 2801.60] Count I want to tell everybody this, especially
[2798.64 - 2805.56] To my young friends who have just turned 18
[2801.60 - 2808.96] Those who have gone will vote this time brother
[2805.56 - 2812.24] In this life if someone comes to you first
[2808.96 - 2815.40] if you have the right to vote then you have the right to vote
[2812.24 - 2817.96] Rights: If you vote then only you can change the country
[2815.40 - 2820.52] how can you do it
[2817.96 - 2823.24] If I cast my vote, I
[2820.52 - 2825.32] I will choose my candidate according to what I read
[2823.24 - 2828.00] It is written that one who is wise is good for the country
[2825.32 - 2830.88] But all the small children say that bhaiya mai
[2828.00 - 2832.88] Votes will not count so many lax of
[2830.88 - 2837.00] People are voting, this is what I am trying to explain
[2832.88 - 2838.92] Yes, Bhaiya they say that it is thousands of miles away
[2837.00 - 2841.80] The journey begins with a small step
[2838.92 - 2844.16] It is correct and this which was the ocean is not the sea
[2841.80 - 2847.56] How much bigger is the ocean than each drop
[2844.16 - 2849.80] It would be correct if all of you had one vote, if you
[2847.56 - 2852.76] If you do not cast your vote on time then you
[2849.80 - 2854.68] You are causing the biggest loss to the country
[2852.76 - 2856.52] Do not choose such a candidate otherwise your
[2854.68 - 2858.60] Don't choose money for personal gain
[2856.52 - 2861.32] choose me for this choose me for this job
[2858.60 - 2863.52] You choose that person under family pressure
[2861.32 - 2867.20] Vote for whoever's ideas you like.
[2863.52 - 2870.68] you do it good for our country
[2867.20 - 2873.76] It is good for us, brother, if you
[2870.68 - 2876.64] Now if I did not vote then the country's biggest
[2873.76 - 2878.60] Every vote becomes a single vote which harms you
[2876.64 - 2882.48] Address at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sahib's government
[2878.60 - 2885.96] We fell in the parliament by one vote
[2882.48 - 2889.04] Correct, in 1999 his government fell by one vote
[2885.96 - 2892.32] So what if she had gone, brother, every single vote
[2889.04 - 2894.88] There is a lot of count so go ahead and vote
[2892.32 - 2897.84] Isn't it true that you vote not for yourself but for your family?
[2894.88 - 2899.96] Do it for the society, do it for the country
[2897.84 - 2901.92] This is your vote, every vote will count I am somewhere
[2899.96 - 2903.48] I am here too, many people say that the country
[2901.92 - 2905.08] The government is not changing and is not doing this work
[2903.48 - 2907.32] The government is not doing that work and on the day of voting
[2905.08 - 2909.84] You would have been roaming around a lot on vacation, that's right
[2907.32 - 2913.84] Brother, the country or the government will work then, remember that
[2909.84 - 2916.20] This is all ours, we elect our representatives
[2913.84 - 2919.04] So brother, if we choose well then the country
[2916.20 - 2921.04] Yours will do a good job for your rights
[2919.04 - 2922.44] So this is it now when you assume that it is from some area
[2921.04 - 2924.48] He is SP and DC, he won't refuse you.
[2922.44 - 2927.08] If the person refuses to work then it means you
[2924.48 - 2928.80] You don't know your rights, we pay taxes
[2927.08 - 2931.80] We pay with the money we earn
[2928.80 - 2935.00] Prime Minister sahab gets salary
[2931.80 - 2937.08] He is not ours, he is our servant Modi
[2935.00 - 2939.72] Yes, you are right, they are servants because servants
[2937.08 - 2941.36] That's because we voted for him, brother.
[2939.72 - 2943.44] With every rupee that we earn, we
[2941.36 - 2945.68] Democracy is getting stronger and the country is moving forward
[2943.44 - 2948.92] everything is going on with him but then he
[2945.68 - 2951.60] It will only work when we use our votes correctly
[2948.92 - 2954.48] I will use my vote in the right way
[2951.60 - 2957.08] If you want to cast your vote then please do cast your vote, brother. I am
[2954.48 - 2960.20] I will request and what used to happen before
[2957.08 - 2961.96] Earlier there used to be Panch Parmeshwar who used to rule the village
[2960.20 - 2964.28] He was a sensible person, we would have chosen him
[2961.96 - 2967.28] Correct, this is another thing to decide
[2964.28 - 2970.52] Brother how many seats are there these days and how much is your 500
[2967.28 - 2972.88] f 40 40 something something like that 540 something like that
[2970.52 - 2976.24] yes so nowadays out of 540 there are more than 500
[2972.88 - 2979.04] It is a different matter that earlier Panch Parmeshwar would have been there
[2976.24 - 2980.72] You must cast your vote, brother.
[2979.04 - 2983.60] If we don't use our vote properly
[2980.72 - 2985.48] If we do not do this then understand that we are not doing anything for our life
[2983.60 - 2989.04] not using
[2985.48 - 2992.04] then every single vote counts a lot and
[2989.04 - 2994.56] Especially for the new kid who is between 18 to 30
[2992.04 - 2996.40] If you choose a young candidate, then you will remember the country
[2994.56 - 2997.92] If you want to keep the country then all of you have to change
[2996.40 - 3000.24] Some sports star will become a film star
[2997.92 - 3002.44] Someone will become a hotshot, someone will become a politician
[3000.24 - 3004.32] Someone will become a bureaucrat if you cast your vote
[3002.44 - 3006.48] Where will you put it from, what will you become brother
[3004.32 - 3009.00] Where will the infrastructure come from?
[3006.48 - 3011.20] what will happen new thinking is needed yes new thinking is needed
[3009.00 - 3014.04] A completely new idea will come only when you think in the right way
[3011.20 - 3018.04] Choose the right candidate who is good for the country
[3014.04 - 3020.28] If it is good for everyone then please vote.
[3018.04 - 3024.12] The right to vote is the biggest right
[3020.28 - 3028.00] hai to sangram speaking of voting and
[3024.12 - 3032.20] The choices the young people have to make now are what people
[3028.00 - 3035.12] Are you getting older? You were an athlete first.
[3032.20 - 3038.52] Celebrity Now Again You Went Back and You
[3035.12 - 3040.96] are winning what was the mind shift in your
[3038.52 - 3043.64] How did this switch turn inside my brain?
[3040.96 - 3046.88] People think that right now it is 40, 50, 60
[3043.64 - 3050.40] should retire from exercise from
[3046.88 - 3053.60] You Dieted But You Went Back Into Training
[3050.40 - 3056.64] in to diet back in to winning what was the
[3053.60 - 3058.64] The journey where the switch was, let me tell you now
[3056.64 - 3061.28] Yes, the word wrestler has been removed from my name.
[3058.64 - 3064.32] I will give nothing if there is something in front of my name
[3061.28 - 3065.84] If I remove the wrestler from there nothing will happen
[3064.32 - 3067.80] No matter how big an actor I become
[3065.84 - 3070.40] No matter how big a speaker I become
[3067.80 - 3073.00] I should become a big entrepreneur and I should become healthy.
[3070.40 - 3075.76] But as long as I am alive, my
[3073.00 - 3077.20] She is a wrestler, my identity will always be in my blood
[3075.76 - 3080.20] I will stay here, it is not that I am very big
[3077.20 - 3084.60] I am a wrestler, but whatever I am is connected to me
[3080.20 - 3087.60] will remain and I believe that
[3084.60 - 3090.72] Bhaiyya Legacy Matter
[3087.60 - 3092.20] True luck isn't that you're winning
[3090.72 - 3094.60] You are not doing this match for yourself
[3092.20 - 3096.44] I played this for all those kids
[3094.60 - 3098.96] those who give up in their life,
[3096.44 - 3100.80] I give up when this comes to my mind
[3098.96 - 3103.68] did you realize I was not here?
[3100.80 - 3106.68] I was on a flight and someone was saying this
[3103.68 - 3108.84] brother what is the condition of wrestling
[3106.68 - 3111.32] There is something going on in wrestling, this is happening
[3108.84 - 3113.84] Everything is going on, why should we harm our children
[3111.32 - 3115.52] Why should I put you in wrestling? So I
[3113.84 - 3117.36] that hurt your heart yes i feel very hurt
[3115.52 - 3120.28] that I did not wrestle as a gentleman
[3117.36 - 3123.44] It's a game, I said I'm watching it, then I
[3120.28 - 3126.08] I thought that winning or losing does not matter
[3123.44 - 3127.60] The important thing is that I always say one thing
[3126.08 - 3129.32] I say that a champion is not one who
[3127.60 - 3131.76] Comes first, wins medal, wins trophy
[3129.32 - 3134.68] A champion is one who keeps trying
[3131.76 - 3137.28] do the effort do the effort but this dozen have to
[3134.68 - 3140.56] be only in athletics it can be anybody
[3137.28 - 3143.68] office g office office some effort in that too
[3140.56 - 3145.24] do you don't care until you play that
[3143.68 - 3147.20] Don't leave any field until you are in it
[3145.24 - 3150.00] while you're in the field
[3147.20 - 3152.24] Don't give up, until you win you are mine
[3150.00 - 3154.48] When it came to my mind, I thought about it and I
[3152.24 - 3158.20] I am telling you all, I am telling you all today
[3154.48 - 3162.08] that actually a person spends 45 years in it
[3158.20 - 3165.04] The person is a boy or a girl and is actually young
[3162.08 - 3167.84] It happens mentally and physically till 45
[3165.04 - 3170.80] Our bones mature and become our strength
[3167.84 - 3174.64] And our brain development should also happen
[3170.80 - 3177.40] goes from 45 to 75 you're the angry young man young
[3174.64 - 3179.72] You live as a Memon, it is your choice whether you are 20 years old or not
[3177.40 - 3181.88] grow old or stay young for 100 years
[3179.72 - 3185.08] I believe that right now I am between five and seven years old.
[3181.88 - 3186.88] I will rest for one more year and do it professionally
[3185.08 - 3189.00] I will differentiate the result
[3186.88 - 3190.44] There is no one like that, you tell me today that the Olympics
[3189.00 - 3192.68] I would say that when I wrestle with the champion
[3190.44 - 3195.44] Yes, I will definitely play because I have passion
[3192.68 - 3199.84] I do it for passion, be passionate
[3195.44 - 3199.84] it won't make any difference to anyone ha how d we
[3206.80 - 3212.88] Ranji was playing wrestling, was playing tennis
[3209.60 - 3217.48] I was playing, I represented in college
[3212.88 - 3220.84] Remember, Alexander is not at the feet of circumstances
[3217.48 - 3224.12] There is no falling star on the ground
[3220.84 - 3226.60] The rivers of grief fall into the sea
[3224.12 - 3229.52] But if the ocean does not fall into any river,
[3226.60 - 3232.92] Brother, success and excuses don't go together
[3229.52 - 3234.80] There are people outside, your success will follow
[3232.92 - 3237.28] I will see you but you won't see your excuses
[3234.80 - 3239.84] what did you do what did you not do excuse me
[3237.28 - 3242.80] don't walk together if you
[3239.84 - 3245.80] Excuse me then forget about success if you
[3242.80 - 3247.76] want to success then don't give excuse to
[3245.80 - 3249.48] I am telling you how much illness I have
[3247.76 - 3251.72] Has anyone suffered so much in their life?
[3249.48 - 3253.76] no i couldn't stand i couldn't walk
[3251.72 - 3257.28] I couldn't I couldn't speak my
[3253.76 - 3259.68] My eyes would open, but I would not move my body.
[3257.28 - 3261.32] I was in pain and I had become very thin
[3259.68 - 3263.52] Doctors say he is alive for more than six months
[3261.32 - 3264.96] I didn't even have enough money for my
[3263.52 - 3266.68] My mother used to carry me in her arms
[3264.96 - 3269.00] two-three kilometers because he has to go to the bus
[3266.68 - 3270.88] all these things would not have fallen
[3269.00 - 3273.04] I used to keep an extra roti for myself
[3270.88 - 3274.44] There was no food and no child
[3273.04 - 3276.80] I am not telling you that I am not getting my diet
[3274.44 - 3278.88] The situation is that I am waiting for the whole day to recover.
[3276.80 - 3281.48] Later I used to work in the fields, I had a job
[3278.88 - 3283.52] I used to do it after that and even now I
[3281.48 - 3285.44] I can travel anywhere and do something anywhere
[3283.52 - 3288.04] I work out and do these things
[3285.44 - 3290.28] Because I know that this is my one brother
[3288.04 - 3291.72] These are the things you make excuses for
[3290.28 - 3294.16] So give me some excuse for my health today
[3291.72 - 3296.56] The weather is bad today, there must be some drunkard
[3294.16 - 3299.16] You were in common with my father
[3296.56 - 3302.36] Earlier they used to beat me but the day I would say that
[3299.16 - 3305.48] Leave it now, it's very hot today friend
[3302.36 - 3308.52] It's very cold today and I'm a little sad today
[3305.48 - 3311.40] He is very happy, which means he finds every excuse
[3308.52 - 3313.48] and used to say that he did not know Hindi properly
[3311.40 - 3315.00] Thi PK used to speak English meaning two pack
[3313.48 - 3317.52] They beat me up, then I told them I convinced them
[3315.00 - 3320.00] He left it all and later explained that
[3317.52 - 3323.68] The brother who is my elder brother,
[3320.00 - 3325.48] Explained that we did that, we are humans, there are no excuses
[3323.68 - 3327.56] How many will you find, there was a doctor many days ago
[3325.48 - 3330.00] He said that brother this liver becomes ciro
[3327.56 - 3332.40] Yes, doctor sahab, I am yours only, said
[3330.00 - 3334.88] So I said I don't know how to spell
[3332.40 - 3336.76] I don't know if this is it
[3334.88 - 3339.16] What is uric acid? What is the second thing or the third?
[3336.76 - 3342.28] I don't even know what that thing is
[3339.16 - 3344.40] Everything is here, inside the mind
[3342.28 - 3346.16] It is inside brother, if you thought about it today you could do it
[3344.40 - 3348.48] maybe when i started wrestling
[3346.16 - 3350.52] You won't believe that I went to the mat
[3348.48 - 3353.12] I had six rounds of two minutes and three minutes each.
[3350.52 - 3355.88] I am here for a couple of minutes on Professional Men's Health.
[3353.12 - 3359.16] I was getting tired. I completed one round on the first day.
[3355.88 - 3361.40] When I said no, everyone was laughing and everyone said
[3359.16 - 3363.56] Leave it, I think I'm very crazy
[3361.40 - 3365.32] I am a human being, being normal is boring being
[3363.56 - 3366.80] Normal is boring and you should be crazy
[3365.32 - 3369.92] must be crazy until you go insane
[3366.80 - 3371.32] No yes, remember this, who knows the world
[3369.92 - 3373.40] The world was changed by those who
[3371.32 - 3377.32] The world is not worth changing anything
[3373.40 - 3380.40] understand and don't be ordinary be extra
[3377.32 - 3382.40] Be ordinary and don't remember that this world
[3380.40 - 3385.04] Those few mad people who were changed, who had faith in themselves
[3382.40 - 3387.28] There was trust and you are wise about them, right?
[3385.04 - 3389.92] I sit and read, I did this and I did that
[3387.28 - 3392.68] I gave it and did everything and I always say one thing
[3389.92 - 3395.36] I say, until the world is on your dream
[3392.68 - 3398.20] If you are not laughing then understand that your dream is small
[3395.36 - 3400.08] and the one on whom the world depends is history
[3398.20 - 3402.48] And history is created by mad people
[3400.08 - 3405.00] If someone creates then I went to the mat on the first day
[3402.48 - 3406.48] It got peeled from here It got peeled from here Two minutes
[3405.00 - 3410.36] The round is not happening, tell me about Delhi
[3406.48 - 3412.80] I am feeling very cold, so everybody was laughing
[3410.36 - 3414.64] Everybody was sitting and doing all this, I did it on my
[3412.80 - 3419.28] thought of you that
[3414.64 - 3422.64] Brother, there is a horse, I am a racing horse
[3419.28 - 3425.64] horse if he doesn't run then horse
[3422.64 - 3428.56] won't live much longer and someone or the other
[3425.64 - 3431.40] die sooner due to illness
[3428.56 - 3433.00] If I go then my habit was the same bhaiya that brother if
[3431.40 - 3435.00] If I cannot do this then my life
[3433.00 - 3437.44] what is the purpose of what we are thinking
[3435.00 - 3440.28] If you don't get it then what is the use in this world
[3437.44 - 3444.52] Neither do people die after 30 years nor at 95
[3440.28 - 3446.88] mine dies here listen where do they die
[3444.52 - 3448.80] we die because of the situation
[3446.88 - 3450.88] I believe that if you fail then you should fail after working.
[3448.80 - 3452.64] yes, you like the one you love
[3450.88 - 3455.04] Meaning if there is regret and risk in life
[3452.64 - 3457.00] Always choose risk, if you have to choose wealth then sometimes
[3455.04 - 3458.52] If I don't have any regrets then I will be gone for two minutes
[3457.00 - 3461.48] I couldn't make the round, I came and sat down and watched
[3458.52 - 3464.16] My body is not getting up, I am not able to raise my hand
[3461.48 - 3465.96] Everything is not happening and I am sitting here
[3464.16 - 3468.08] This is the training in such a mirror
[3465.96 - 3469.80] Right now in training I am using this mirror
[3468.08 - 3472.44] When I was washing my face I didn't even wash it
[3469.80 - 3474.76] it was hurting so much hurting so much
[3472.44 - 3477.76] I am looking at myself and he is looking at me
[3474.76 - 3480.24] I swear I had a few tears in my eyes
[3477.76 - 3483.08] but that was redness what did you tell
[3480.24 - 3485.48] What is your inner dialogue with yourself?
[3483.08 - 3488.08] was to motivate because they must be
[3485.48 - 3491.32] There must be some voice saying, start the fight
[3488.08 - 3493.00] I have grown old, give up, dialogue inside me
[3491.32 - 3495.40] This was because he had heard from her a few days before
[3493.00 - 3498.28] I had a problem with my food pipe
[3495.40 - 3499.76] yes, I didn't know some food got stuck
[3498.28 - 3502.16] I did not believe all this when I went to a doctor
[3499.76 - 3504.16] I took him to the doctor and said that brother your food pipe
[3502.16 - 3508.48] It's alright, he might have some injury
[3504.16 - 3510.84] Be it cancer, TB, infection or something else
[3508.48 - 3514.00] You get it endoscopy done, I got it done
[3510.84 - 3516.32] no because everybody was saying the same thing then when
[3514.00 - 3517.88] I was doing that thing everyday no
[3516.32 - 3522.16] Someone used to give knowledge because in India
[3517.88 - 3524.16] What is it that on 99 there is Raichand Raichand means
[3522.16 - 3525.96] Giving you free advice is useless work
[3524.16 - 3530.32] on one
[3525.96 - 3532.48] hat so true so true india 99 raichand to
[3530.32 - 3534.40] I was thinking that day in the evening
[3532.48 - 3536.64] I did not eat food on the days I did not work out
[3534.40 - 3538.84] does not eat food
[3536.64 - 3540.68] that brother I do not deserve this food
[3538.84 - 3542.44] Any food on the day I exercise
[3540.68 - 3543.76] I eat food I go to the airport
[3542.44 - 3546.64] I go there too, I don't sit in the lounge
[3543.76 - 3548.40] Nowadays let's do business class, I will do that
[3546.64 - 3550.60] I go to the airport in business class
[3548.40 - 3552.40] Normally I go to the toilet while working out
[3550.60 - 3554.28] I run and do five dips
[3552.40 - 3557.52] Who knows what the people outside think, his stomach is upset
[3554.28 - 3559.28] yes I am coming many laugh that he was
[3557.52 - 3561.36] You may be suffering from constipation or loose motions
[3559.28 - 3564.48] He is sitting in the toilet but I can reach there on time
[3561.36 - 3567.48] I do it, I hold it in my hand
[3564.48 - 3569.20] I work out on chair 16
[3567.48 - 3571.96] I was not able to wash my face, so for me
[3569.20 - 3574.08] It was very hurting, I stayed in a hotel room
[3571.96 - 3578.16] I was staying in a good hotel in Delhi
[3574.08 - 3579.44] I closed my room and put my phone down and nowadays I am fast
[3578.16 - 3581.36] I do it, I donâ€™t fast from eating
[3579.44 - 3583.36] I do a gadget fast one day gadget
[3581.36 - 3585.08] If you fast during the week, then you should fast
[3583.36 - 3589.00] If yes then there is no difference in eating or fasting
[3585.08 - 3591.56] use the gadget fast and speak less and think
[3589.00 - 3593.88] Not much if you talk to yourself for 5 minutes
[3591.56 - 3595.92] If you do this then understand that you are the best in the world
[3593.88 - 3598.36] Missing the chance to talk to a beautiful person
[3595.92 - 3600.12] yes they say that we should meet ourselves
[3598.36 - 3604.56] We come to meet the world and then let's go
[3600.12 - 3607.72] wow i learned something today
[3604.56 - 3609.72] I talked to myself, sat down and looked at what I was writing
[3607.72 - 3611.04] I am not such a great wrestler that I can beat anyone
[3609.72 - 3613.52] Many big people have come who are bigger than me
[3611.04 - 3614.92] There are more big ones to come, but I believe this
[3613.52 - 3618.48] that brother i want to give my best to sports
[3614.92 - 3621.08] I want to leave the legacy again
[3618.48 - 3622.96] When I thought I went the next day I went the next
[3621.08 - 3625.00] The day I went to the pen I had a fever of 102
[3622.96 - 3628.84] I went back to training the next day, same
[3625.00 - 3632.32] I wore my shoes and did the whole thing
[3628.84 - 3635.88] I'm applying this on the same shoulder and that on the other.
[3632.32 - 3638.88] hmm that one with the pen is spraying
[3635.88 - 3641.12] I am here and I am doing everything, I did not give it to you that day
[3638.88 - 3643.08] On the first day I did a two minute round
[3641.12 - 3645.96] did I die the next day due to fever
[3643.08 - 3649.00] He made rounds and then thought of leaving it
[3645.96 - 3653.96] On the third day I went back for training, I remembered this
[3649.00 - 3656.72] Keep this body and this mind, these are your best
[3653.96 - 3658.44] The best servant and the harshest master
[3656.72 - 3660.88] If you make him your servant, then
[3658.44 - 3663.44] He will keep doing that for you and you will make him your master
[3660.88 - 3665.68] Then these things will ruin your life
[3663.44 - 3667.68] he won't do it, he is too lazy to burn it
[3665.68 - 3670.32] if it has to be buried then you can use it as much as you want
[3667.68 - 3674.04] Yes, work with your mind as well as your body
[3670.32 - 3676.36] so the mind is the boss mind and body
[3674.04 - 3678.76] These two are such that the mind has said this here
[3676.36 - 3681.44] If you order from me then you know if this body will work
[3678.76 - 3683.08] What is it? I am the owner of my body.
[3681.44 - 3684.52] I hold three switches now I'm sitting with you
[3683.08 - 3686.40] I am sitting with you, I am not thinking
[3684.52 - 3689.16] What is happening in the world, let it happen brother
[3686.40 - 3690.20] I'll keep my three switches wherever they are
[3689.16 - 3692.20] Many know what they do
[3690.20 - 3694.20] They go to Switzerland, there
[3692.20 - 3695.68] Let's make a video, ok I saw that
[3694.20 - 3697.08] If you were in Switzerland, you would have been at home
[3695.68 - 3699.24] When I'm at home I'm in Switzerland
[3697.08 - 3700.72] Were watching a movie then that other thing happened
[3699.24 - 3702.92] if you were looking at something else
[3700.72 - 3704.76] you are looking at something else wherever you are
[3702.92 - 3708.96] be perfect there
[3704.76 - 3710.92] If you go then I have to fight that every day
[3708.96 - 3712.72] I had a fight with myself, I didn't know anyone
[3710.92 - 3714.52] There was no connection with the Pakistani wrestler
[3712.72 - 3717.76] it wasn't with the third one and the fight was with me
[3714.52 - 3719.84] I knew it was by myself
[3717.76 - 3722.40] What if you win over yourself
[3719.84 - 3724.92] Then we become Indrajit, otherwise we
[3722.40 - 3728.60] If he remains normal then all the other wrestlers are laughing
[3724.92 - 3731.12] You were there so I made it 2*2 in the second day
[3728.60 - 3734.28] I had a fever of 103 on the third day.
[3731.12 - 3737.80] It happened and if the fever did not go down then he said
[3734.28 - 3742.04] Bhaiya, I took this painkiller pill.
[3737.80 - 3744.96] no, I eat less, I took pills for everything
[3742.04 - 3746.36] I went to the doctor on the third day, then I
[3744.96 - 3748.92] got this checkup done
[3746.36 - 3752.32] he went and did the whole body from toe to head
[3748.92 - 3754.24] He said that brother your height is like a deer
[3752.32 - 3757.76] if it would have been gaya deer then this would have been yours
[3754.24 - 3760.12] The acid comes up and causes damage to your food pipe.
[3757.76 - 3761.48] if you exercise your scalp
[3760.12 - 3764.72] If not, then for your life
[3761.48 - 3767.60] be responsible i don't have to do all this
[3764.72 - 3769.08] I thought, brother will remain alive, so I
[3767.60 - 3770.68] You know, when I recovered from arthritis
[3769.08 - 3772.24] What did my mother tell me, son?
[3770.68 - 3774.44] There are two types of people in life
[3772.24 - 3776.40] There are some who become a part of history
[3774.44 - 3778.08] we create
[3776.40 - 3780.60] I believe so then I thought that you
[3778.08 - 3783.24] I will die running, not on the bed
[3780.60 - 3785.28] I said brother, no matter how much I am
[3783.24 - 3787.28] Do more workouts in your home
[3785.28 - 3789.76] A guest will come, give him good food
[3787.28 - 3791.32] serve him well he will stay for five more days
[3789.76 - 3794.68] On the first day you gave me less food and
[3791.32 - 3796.60] If something gets tough, he will run away the next day
[3794.68 - 3798.48] The pen is also the same, this is where I am from
[3796.60 - 3802.32] I don't know if I should do the treatment
[3798.48 - 3804.96] Do everything, take a prize, but I
[3802.32 - 3806.60] I am a little crazy, which means I deal differently
[3804.96 - 3809.08] am so
[3806.60 - 3811.12] That 20-30-40 day process was a marathon
[3809.08 - 3813.60] I went there as the chief guest
[3811.12 - 3816.40] There was commitment, you were sure
[3813.60 - 3818.60] I will show that flag to them all
[3816.40 - 3821.00] 5 kit marathon in 28 minutes of the first part
[3818.60 - 3823.24] I came back after doing it and I ran less and my weight increased
[3821.00 - 3826.12] I went because I was so wet that I didn't do the movie
[3823.24 - 3829.56] I was 81, 82 so I started playing 90 to 100
[3826.12 - 3832.40] I weighed 87-88.
[3829.56 - 3834.48] I was drinking almonds everyday and was doing everything
[3832.40 - 3838.84] I was coming back to that basic thing, food
[3834.48 - 3842.04] The one who used to drink in the arena, be it milk or ghee
[3838.84 - 3844.56] what's left, what is all this and more training
[3842.04 - 3845.92] Earlier I used to do muscle ups every day
[3844.56 - 3847.56] I was not this fit when I was 20-25 years old
[3845.92 - 3849.96] I was not that fit, should I do muscle ups or
[3847.56 - 3851.44] I can do front and back line now I am so fit
[3849.96 - 3854.44] I will walk on my hands from here to Bangalore
[3851.44 - 3856.12] I will reach there, I am not tired
[3854.44 - 3858.48] My mind doesn't know what it means to be tired
[3856.12 - 3860.00] if it's a game then remember those who make excuses
[3858.48 - 3862.04] Aren't you 40, the doctor is saying
[3860.00 - 3864.80] that brother now this will come from the market, that will come
[3862.04 - 3866.60] nothing i am saying you are up to 75
[3864.80 - 3868.44] If you can wrestle then Gasti is the toughest
[3866.60 - 3870.36] There is sports like boxing, there should be gloves
[3868.44 - 3873.00] We will go to Judo and clothes will become cricket
[3870.36 - 3874.76] I will become a bat in badminton
[3873.00 - 3877.32] The racket will become just a body to body match in wrestling
[3874.76 - 3880.08] The body is connected and you can wrestle till 70 years
[3877.32 - 3881.64] If you continue then it may not matter
[3880.08 - 3883.84] I don't think that you will lose, then nothing will happen
[3881.64 - 3886.52] So brother, these are all excuses, someone tells you
[3883.84 - 3888.84] You should get this check done after 40
[3886.52 - 3891.32] Do it, it is a good thing but don't worry
[3888.84 - 3893.00] He doesn't need this heart attack either
[3891.32 - 3895.32] Those who think too much remember
[3893.00 - 3897.44] keep it, those who enjoy life a little
[3895.32 - 3900.40] Three are more sensible than crazy
[3897.44 - 3903.04] we remain entangled in the five and live our life
[3900.40 - 3904.92] A highly educated person does not go
[3903.04 - 3906.88] Life is lived, nothing much happens
[3904.92 - 3908.92] Only a fool like me can do this
[3906.88 - 3913.44] No, he lives his life and does everything
[3908.92 - 3916.20] if you don't understand then this one comes
[3913.44 - 3918.04] The one who couldn't do two minutes on the first day
[3916.20 - 3918.84] I reached 10 rounds of three minutes each
[3918.04 - 3922.36] Went
[3918.84 - 3924.96] Before wrestling I used to do 10 minutes of three-three minutes
[3922.36 - 3927.88] I was doing rounds and 10 minutes of each
[3924.96 - 3932.16] You can hardly complete five to six rounds.
[3927.88 - 3933.96] If you will find me and I are not together then
[3932.16 - 3937.12] One race was getting tired, then four four five five
[3933.96 - 3941.00] Doing rounds with wrestler in standings
[3937.12 - 3945.12] In this, a wrestler beats him with his neck
[3941.00 - 3947.72] Dharam Pahalwan is very senior in GCF now
[3945.12 - 3949.88] I met the chief coach who became an officer
[3947.72 - 3951.84] requested a very senior person to be with him sometime
[3949.88 - 3954.60] There was wrestling in the Dangal too, so the wrestler ji
[3951.84 - 3957.80] Now he will have to practice a lot
[3954.60 - 3961.32] There was a coach who got me along with Bhupesh ji Bhupesh
[3957.80 - 3962.80] Kumar ji, we kept on doing all this,
[3961.32 - 3964.24] I am traveling anywhere all day long
[3962.80 - 3966.24] If I am doing anything then I am doing this work only
[3964.24 - 3969.04] If I am here and going somewhere then I am here
[3966.24 - 3970.60] I am working but I am getting so much trouble in it
[3969.04 - 3973.68] did i enjoy
[3970.60 - 3975.56] Let me tell you, I used to go to other places, now I
[3973.68 - 3977.28] I am ready to play the second match
[3975.56 - 3979.64] not that I'm a match to do the thing
[3977.28 - 3982.96] played and sat and I did that
[3979.64 - 3984.04] Remember that even a donkey takes two and a half days
[3982.96 - 3987.16] coming
[3984.04 - 3990.96] There are two and a half days, even a donkey comes once
[3987.16 - 3993.88] Everybody reaches the top, yes that is correct brother
[3990.96 - 3995.36] A champion is one who goes to the top and achieves that thing
[3993.88 - 3998.04] maintains the
[3995.36 - 4002.00] and I get a lot of inspiration too
[3998.04 - 4004.84] not from the children or from all these because everything
[4002.00 - 4006.60] You have a limitation here now, one pony each
[4004.84 - 4008.24] There is a pony that runs in the carriage
[4006.60 - 4011.12] The owner of the pony will know how much money he will get by evening
[4008.24 - 4014.68] earns 000 00 broken down and remains broken
[4011.12 - 4017.40] The horse lives for a single penny and kills crores
[4014.68 - 4019.60] Bhaiya earns money in two and a half kilometer
[4017.40 - 4021.88] Now you need your mind to become that horse
[4019.60 - 4024.44] I don't know that it is not our defeat
[4021.88 - 4026.32] The world does not recognize us, that is our defeat
[4024.44 - 4029.44] that we ourselves are not
[4026.32 - 4031.16] If we recognize ourselves, we would
[4029.44 - 4033.16] Then there is no problem as to what this is
[4031.16 - 4036.20] I know myself, what do we need
[4033.16 - 4037.80] So to do that means nothing to me
[4036.20 - 4040.24] It doesn't matter as much as the judgement increases
[4037.80 - 4041.68] I'm leaving everything behind, I mean nothing
[4040.24 - 4043.68] I am absolutely selfless, what for?
[4041.68 - 4047.80] I am not even alive, I am leaving this thing
[4043.68 - 4050.80] ko powerful word sagaram you did a
[4047.80 - 4055.84] Movie Yes Recently I did a movie Udaan
[4050.80 - 4062.16] life is like flight of life about it
[4055.84 - 4064.56] tell me what was your wrestler but movies
[4062.16 - 4067.12] what was the journey over while i watched movies
[4064.56 - 4068.68] I have done it before but there were not so many of these
[4067.12 - 4070.28] Our chief minister sahab is very good to me
[4068.68 - 4072.76] When I was a friend, he said, my friend is here, right?
[4070.28 - 4075.48] There is youth here, right? Gangster type movies
[4072.76 - 4078.96] does he watch it or is he more inclined towards drugs you should
[4075.48 - 4080.44] and that influences you should do something then
[4078.96 - 4083.48] I said sir I don't understand what should I do
[4080.44 - 4085.00] He said friend if you don't do it then who will do it
[4083.48 - 4087.56] Then I had this movie and a child
[4085.00 - 4088.96] FTI pass out means so he told me
[4087.56 - 4090.80] He kept sending me the scripts so I
[4088.96 - 4093.36] I was going somewhere to Dubai so I
[4090.80 - 4095.68] I read the script on the flight and
[4093.36 - 4098.28] this movie was very good one should do
[4095.68 - 4100.44] The OTT there has also bought it now
[4098.28 - 4103.60] I have done songs there and now they have been released
[4100.44 - 4106.04] three shootings done, all done
[4103.60 - 4108.12] would you believe that 20-20-22 year old children
[4106.04 - 4110.68] sang the song 202 year old wrote the song 202 year old
[4108.12 - 4112.32] K did a wonderful shoot and those
[4110.68 - 4114.64] The children have no work and are sitting idle
[4112.32 - 4116.40] Those are gangster or drug songs
[4114.64 - 4119.28] he sings it he is a big hit he has many
[4116.40 - 4121.60] There is work but after that that thing means they have
[4119.28 - 4123.52] I believe that trend setter will come in handy
[4121.60 - 4126.16] I have fought against many superstars here.
[4123.52 - 4128.76] I have left negative roles, do you know why?
[4126.16 - 4130.44] There are names of each movie so let's go out
[4128.76 - 4132.68] I refused to come to wrestling like Dangal
[4130.44 - 4135.52] I told Aamir ji that he is a superstar
[4132.68 - 4137.72] And he called me to his home and sat there with Sangram
[4135.52 - 4140.00] It is a very good role I said Bhai sahab 20
[4137.72 - 4142.48] It is a 2 R minute roll and
[4140.00 - 4143.88] In the end there is a fight between you and me so I
[4142.48 - 4146.84] I said it's a very good thing
[4143.88 - 4148.48] What is this character doing, said this terrorist
[4146.84 - 4151.68] he kidnaps children
[4148.48 - 4154.04] yes i said i am busy at that time
[4151.68 - 4155.44] He told me to do it according to your time at that time
[4154.04 - 4158.08] Then I wrote him a long message
[4155.44 - 4160.76] He sent that brother this is the matter
[4158.08 - 4164.76] My aim is not just to become an actor.
[4160.76 - 4167.24] my aim is to leave lacey
[4164.76 - 4170.56] I don't work for money, nor do I work for anyone
[4167.24 - 4172.68] I work for something no matter what I do
[4170.56 - 4176.64] So then I told him
[4172.68 - 4179.80] We were born heroes
[4176.64 - 4181.88] If it's true then I would die for any such role
[4179.80 - 4183.40] does not do that which is not notional is negative first
[4181.88 - 4185.52] I didn't know what to do with Bigg Boss
[4183.40 - 4187.00] I did all of these when I bought the house
[4185.52 - 4189.08] I had a little bit of money before
[4187.00 - 4192.12] There was no money in sports, now the money is going
[4189.08 - 4194.00] So now it has come when I used to farm there
[4192.12 - 4196.64] I still remember the days when we used to run around for visa fees
[4194.00 - 4198.04] 2005 Senior World Racing Championships
[4196.64 - 4200.00] I was going to play I was running for the visa
[4198.04 - 4203.72] I was running for visa visa fee
[4200.00 - 4206.48] I used to play in 96 kg so when I was playing in Nesal
[4203.72 - 4213.20] Do I get medals or do I win a rupee
[4206.48 - 4215.84] I couldn't even get it, you are understanding it now, right?
[4213.20 - 4217.44] I am doing a couple of more web series
[4215.84 - 4218.48] If I am doing films then I believe that
[4217.44 - 4221.32] That
[4218.48 - 4225.44] Brother, whatever work you do, do it with full force that it is your work
[4221.32 - 4227.44] Someone should learn from it or do everything now that is why
[4225.44 - 4231.48] I did the film so I did the songs and the rest
[4227.44 - 4235.20] I am doing this thing so if Sangram is on set and
[4231.48 - 4237.96] His assistant is Sangram ji
[4235.20 - 4240.44] what do you want to eat then what is coming
[4237.96 - 4241.76] in to your green room you will believe when
[4240.44 - 4244.16] I went to the shooting, I troubled everybody, brother
[4241.76 - 4247.04] you boys you all are younger sisters and brothers
[4244.16 - 4250.52] yes for me to eat and I don't know what sugarcane juice is
[4247.04 - 4255.08] it used to be ok if there were fruits then their change
[4250.52 - 4255.08] it's done my potato
[4255.40 - 4259.80] Then there used to be juice then I said the juice is so much
[4256.88 - 4262.64] it will get spoilt in time keep this you keep this
[4259.80 - 4265.04] So if someone from home used to come, roti from home would come
[4262.64 - 4266.36] I used to get roti and veggies prepared from home
[4265.04 - 4268.84] I don't need anything, get it made for me
[4266.36 - 4272.48] Where was the shooting in Haryana, we did a different
[4268.84 - 4274.00] Whatever I did was different, now I can shoot outside as well
[4272.48 - 4276.96] I do it, I do it here too,
[4274.00 - 4279.64] I'll try to eat that food
[4276.96 - 4281.48] The person who is of age does not eat food at all
[4279.64 - 4283.20] You will eat biscuits, biscuits, how old are you?
[4281.48 - 4286.80] If you eat a fruit then what will happen if you put the seed in it
[4283.20 - 4289.36] If you can have fruit then eat the one which has edge
[4286.80 - 4293.68] If you are of age then you will remain young for a long time
[4289.36 - 4296.68] now we will be 38 40 45 means this this this
[4293.68 - 4299.56] is in a circle so what is in this circle that
[4296.68 - 4302.48] Brother, we are still getting older physically
[4299.56 - 4305.28] Mentally I would go to the set or somewhere else
[4302.48 - 4307.20] He used to be mine and what happened was that earlier I
[4305.28 - 4310.08] I did not know I should tell you that I am many
[4307.20 - 4312.60] I am a better actor than him, now do you know what the problem is?
[4310.08 - 4314.40] Many one or two notes are there with the ball maker
[4312.60 - 4316.04] I am also working where I get to work as a wrestler
[4314.40 - 4317.92] You should understand that they would consider me an actor
[4316.04 - 4319.88] Where an actor should understand, there is wrestling
[4317.92 - 4322.16] If you understand then I am stuck behind all this now
[4319.88 - 4323.76] If you know me then all these wrestlers understand
[4322.16 - 4325.44] then if I do some notional work then more money will be given
[4323.76 - 4327.52] I will work with them and I will work with anyone else
[4325.44 - 4329.64] I am not asking for work, brother, let me tell you once
[4327.52 - 4331.64] Can I tell you about any good opportunity
[4329.64 - 4333.24] Then it is not a habit at all, I think that
[4331.64 - 4335.24] Become a medium, I have worked a lot on TV
[4333.24 - 4337.28] I am a great source of new kids
[4335.24 - 4339.52] I can call someone and tell them brother
[4337.28 - 4342.44] If a mouse burns in a house then you can do something
[4339.52 - 4345.96] If you become a source of help then look at the talent I can see in someone
[4342.44 - 4348.40] I don't ask him but he says that
[4345.96 - 4351.20] God gives and everyone is jealous so I say
[4348.40 - 4354.64] Whatever he would give, he would give it, I just know you
[4351.20 - 4357.72] motivational speaker also will you ever be a
[4354.64 - 4360.96] coach to some big prakash ja saheb mein
[4357.72 - 4364.00] Prakash Ja, a renowned actor, was going to do something
[4360.96 - 4366.40] he is a very good friend
[4364.00 - 4368.24] And he was going to do a film in India
[4366.40 - 4371.40] Buy Pick of First Olympic Medalist KD
[4368.24 - 4374.32] Shyam Benegal ji was acting in the film Jada sahab
[4371.40 - 4376.08] I lost my weight in three years for this film
[4374.32 - 4379.00] I started doing it, started learning Marathi
[4376.08 - 4380.76] I did everything and that movie got announced
[4379.00 - 4382.24] went and then the movie stopped and a
[4380.76 - 4384.76] I signed a contract that I would do another job
[4382.24 - 4388.64] I can't go from here to Versova, Haji
[4384.76 - 4390.36] Ali goes there everyday to town and then he teaches me
[4388.64 - 4391.72] When the film didn't happen then I
[4390.36 - 4394.64] I had some savings and I finished that too
[4391.72 - 4396.56] Because every day I have to go and come and then I sit
[4394.64 - 4398.60] I thought, let me learn this legend
[4396.56 - 4400.80] Whether there is loss or profit I will never
[4398.60 - 4402.20] If I don't think then there will be a change in life
[4400.80 - 4404.64] We should not be afraid to stop change
[4402.20 - 4406.00] We should be afraid, Nagraj Manjule ji became Marathi
[4404.64 - 4409.20] so I told them that you
[4406.00 - 4410.76] Do all that and then make it for Mahesh Bhatt sahab
[4409.20 - 4413.04] I sang along
[4410.76 - 4415.76] What am I saying to Mahesh Bhatt sahab?
[4413.04 - 4417.32] I am going to look at what is yours and whatever is yours
[4415.76 - 4419.92] There is something a little different in your films
[4417.32 - 4422.36] there this is mine is a little different so the first
[4419.92 - 4425.84] The man is talking to me about everything
[4422.36 - 4427.32] So I sang, it was his first song
[4425.84 - 4430.68] My first singer was some boy
[4427.32 - 4434.00] The director was from Pakistan and was India based
[4430.68 - 4436.12] The girl was from Russia or Ukraine something like that
[4434.00 - 4437.24] We shot a lot of it, then there was a film by Mahesh
[4436.12 - 4439.12] Bhatt sahab said that I am doing a film
[4437.24 - 4441.64] I am the god of cricket, this means present Mahesh
[4439.12 - 4444.40] Bhatt sahab was working with two directors
[4441.64 - 4446.68] He was the producer of the film and he also worked for one and a half years
[4444.40 - 4449.44] It was spoiled beyond that, a little bit happened in between
[4446.68 - 4453.04] When Mahesh Bhatt did not do any other work then
[4449.44 - 4456.80] He told me one thing that whoever is a hero
[4453.04 - 4458.32] He is a hero, he romances with his eyes only
[4456.80 - 4461.64] When I did everything with my eyes, I said Imran
[4458.32 - 4463.40] Ami is your hero, means I am not a hero
[4461.64 - 4465.60] If he catches me then I said Imran Ashmi
[4463.40 - 4467.52] your hero is yes sir
[4465.60 - 4469.96] Jax tries to correct but he says no
[4467.52 - 4471.44] His is different, yours is different, you are who
[4469.96 - 4473.44] You say it, it seems that you are right
[4471.44 - 4476.80] If you are then you are Dharmendra sahab or Sunil
[4473.44 - 4479.48] You should watch Dutt's movie so I learned from him
[4476.80 - 4481.20] So Kattu I met Prakash Ja sahab in some
[4479.48 - 4485.52] of another project
[4481.20 - 4487.20] When he took it he said that Bhaiya Sangram ji you are my
[4485.52 - 4489.88] I am building an ashram that you will help
[4487.20 - 4492.36] I said Sir I will supervise the wrestling
[4489.88 - 4496.84] I never did it, I said look at three
[4492.36 - 4498.68] The girls were Aditi and she and also you believe
[4496.84 - 4500.28] I just saw his video, I will walk
[4498.68 - 4501.92] Within three days he made him a wrestler
[4500.28 - 4503.64] made it seem like it's been many years
[4501.92 - 4505.92] Wrestling is fighting a coach to a
[4503.64 - 4508.44] When I coach the physiotherapist
[4505.92 - 4512.04] so I think I'm a lot better
[4508.44 - 4513.76] He will prove to be a coach because I am not dependent on him
[4512.04 - 4515.64] I know that things cannot be imposed
[4513.76 - 4517.40] I go to what is scientific
[4515.64 - 4520.20] What is practical according to nature
[4517.40 - 4522.64] what if you believe in yourself
[4520.20 - 4525.52] If you didn't have self-confidence then you would have been able to
[4522.64 - 4527.68] if you win the trust
[4525.52 - 4529.08] I got what I didn't think, now I don't know
[4527.68 - 4530.96] But I believe that I have
[4529.08 - 4533.08] Everything in life is done half-and-half
[4530.96 - 4536.04] Olympics is the peak of sports
[4533.08 - 4538.64] medal right thing lack of finance lack of
[4536.04 - 4540.96] Lack of guidance could not make up for the situation
[4538.64 - 4543.12] But a lot of kids are trying to become a medium
[4540.96 - 4545.84] I promise I will make him go for the country
[4543.12 - 4548.60] Won medals along with the country and with them
[4545.84 - 4550.60] My dream will actually come true if
[4548.60 - 4553.84] You will come to my office in Bangalore.
[4550.60 - 4557.68] I put a big statement above the door
[4553.84 - 4560.16] I will not rest till one of my
[4557.68 - 4564.72] athlete vinus gold
[4560.16 - 4568.08] Medal is our thinking and not of the nation
[4564.72 - 4571.40] There should be values â€‹â€‹for the child
[4568.08 - 4574.00] you must have a goal if you have a goal
[4571.40 - 4576.04] no you don't have a goal then
[4574.00 - 4579.12] There is no benefit and this country is not with the leaders
[4576.04 - 4581.08] This country is not built by internal conflicts
[4579.12 - 4583.80] This country is not made by anyone else, you make this country
[4581.08 - 4585.84] he did his work he did his work
[4583.80 - 4588.56] I have done my work for us
[4585.84 - 4590.68] Our country has started to be built collectively
[4588.56 - 4593.16] What is your thinking about life collectively?
[4590.68 - 4595.04] Let me tell you about a bird from Swati Nakshatra
[4593.16 - 4597.68] it is very small it is the smallest
[4595.04 - 4599.44] When he opens his mouth he becomes a bird
[4597.68 - 4601.84] He would open his mouth for the rain but his mouth would
[4599.44 - 4604.48] When it rains, it turns into nectar
[4601.84 - 4606.80] And an eagle is the biggest bird
[4604.48 - 4609.24] There is a king but Gid is the tallest
[4606.80 - 4611.40] but it will stay at a height
[4609.24 - 4613.76] to pick up the flesh of a person by scratching his head
[4611.40 - 4616.24] So brother, I want to become a gid in life
[4613.76 - 4619.28] No good Swati nakshatra you are small bird
[4616.24 - 4622.40] Become a bird but your thinking should be right
[4619.28 - 4624.76] Your contribution to I Believe in This Turned In
[4622.40 - 4628.68] You should be positive and not negative
[4624.76 - 4630.72] Now I myself don't know whether an hour
[4628.68 - 4632.76] what will happen later earlier I used to plan that today
[4630.72 - 4634.48] Plan this, do that tomorrow, do this the day after tomorrow
[4632.76 - 4636.12] Whenever I am coming closer to him, I
[4634.48 - 4638.88] I am leaving some plans for the next minute
[4636.12 - 4642.92] I don't know what I'm gonna do
[4638.88 - 4645.80] Gonna try it in your hand
[4642.92 - 4647.56] Efforts never die, there is no end in my life
[4645.80 - 4650.80] There is no word called end means efforts
[4647.56 - 4653.44] never die, no one is there in my life
[4650.80 - 4655.84] means there is no next opportunity
[4653.44 - 4659.16] I have failed in my life, what does failure mean?
[4655.84 - 4662.28] Bhaiya, this is my first attempt in life
[4659.16 - 4667.48] I don't have any talent, I just have a talent
[4662.28 - 4669.52] Never give up in any situation now how much do I care
[4667.48 - 4672.08] No matter how much you do, no matter how much you say
[4669.52 - 4673.48] then I will come and stand again and when
[4672.08 - 4677.32] I was wrestling so my mind was
[4673.48 - 4680.72] there was one thing in me your come back should be strong
[4677.32 - 4682.76] age comparison set back your come back should be
[4680.72 - 4685.36] Stronger than your set backs, stronger than your set backs
[4682.76 - 4688.44] And never give up, never give up even life
[4685.36 - 4690.56] It is the same now, even though I am here
[4688.44 - 4692.88] Mumbai brought me to Mumbai, the biggest city
[4690.56 - 4694.80] We don't know what life is outside the village
[4692.88 - 4697.68] now he goes out too
[4694.80 - 4699.84] yes, I have come here too so take a look at this
[4697.68 - 4702.16] In 3 years, God is such a certain person in the city
[4699.84 - 4705.56] There will be lots of places to change this environment
[4702.16 - 4707.48] I will make it wonderful and it will go to many houses
[4705.56 - 4709.84] I will become the means of burning many things
[4707.48 - 4712.52] If I do it then I believe this
[4709.84 - 4714.56] Isn't it true that nowadays we still have some quality left in us
[4712.52 - 4717.56] There are both merits and demerits
[4714.56 - 4720.32] Everyone has pointed out so many flaws, now only the qualities are there
[4717.56 - 4721.76] What remains is wow and I always say one thing
[4720.32 - 4726.12] am that
[4721.76 - 4729.60] Bhaiya, compliments make the day and so do taunts
[4726.12 - 4732.00] Life is when someone tells you that this is the thing
[4729.60 - 4736.40] If she has gone, I will tell her that brother, everything is fine.
[4732.00 - 4740.80] No problem Sangram Singh came
[4736.40 - 4745.32] I am a broken Hindi speaker but today I
[4740.80 - 4748.60] I've been impressed I've been motivated
[4745.32 - 4751.64] I cancelled my karate class last weekend
[4748.60 - 4753.72] I am 48 years old and you are just that
[4751.64 - 4756.20] yer old young and ya and i just said to

[4760.08 - 4765.04] again and I'm going to tell him never die
[4762.32 - 4767.96] attitude it's been a pleasure sangram singh
[4765.04 - 4770.80] you are truly not a teacher not motivational
[4767.96 - 4774.36] Expert but you are really a guru thank you
[4770.80 - 4778.32] Run bhai thank you we are all in India
[4774.36 - 4780.68] The Guru is the disciple, everything is normal
[4778.32 - 4784.72] Do you know what is in life
[4780.68 - 4786.76] that I believe in one thing I want to die
[4784.72 - 4789.64] with memories no
[4786.76 - 4792.52] I dream whatever comes to my heart
[4789.64 - 4797.16] happens i will try to do this thing
[4792.52 - 4798.92] Ko I live for myself not for the world when
[4797.16 - 4801.68] It is telling me from inside, son, do this thing
[4798.92 - 4804.24] should you should do i rebar you called me
[4801.68 - 4807.60] called this script is correct it is

[4813.36 - 4817.56] that is who you are yes i mean i after reading
[4815.72 - 4818.96] I cannot speak, I do not know the power of God
[4817.56 - 4820.56] what does he say, what should I do
[4818.96 - 4823.00] I am so well educated
[4820.56 - 4826.48] Believe me I don't even read books
[4823.00 - 4828.28] I don't read many books at night
[4826.48 - 4830.44] I read some books as I go somewhere
[4828.28 - 4832.80] I write Hanuman Chalisa everyday
[4830.44 - 4834.96] I do it, that means it's been my routine for so many years
[4832.80 - 4836.88] That means I recite Hanuman Chalisa before sleeping in the morning.
[4834.96 - 4838.44] I wake up after listening to Hanuman ji's Chalisa
[4836.88 - 4841.80] I mean routine
[4838.44 - 4843.92] I am always doubtful, I eat food normally and
[4841.80 - 4845.60] Even when I sleep, I sleep in such a way that brother world
[4843.92 - 4848.24] I am the greatest man of the
[4845.60 - 4850.32] It is me who gets up, even then I get up like this
[4848.24 - 4852.84] and if someone gets angry, something happens
[4850.32 - 4855.80] The day when one laughs the most is the day when one laughs
[4852.84 - 4858.20] hmm assume it's a watch someone will pick it up only then
[4855.80 - 4862.72] I won't buy it, otherwise I would roam around this dam
[4858.20 - 4866.04] If I stay then I will be free from anything in life
[4862.72 - 4869.64] He doesn't do much of what is going on
[4866.04 - 4873.00] Let them keep going, let them do it, let them come, let them go
[4869.64 - 4875.84] This is how the body is, this universe has five elements
[4873.00 - 4876.88] The body is also made up of five elements, look
[4875.84 - 4881.76] These
[4876.88 - 4885.72] fire aag ye air hawa ye sky aasman ye
[4881.76 - 4888.00] Earth, this water, if your mind
[4885.72 - 4890.68] If it is a little disturbed then look at this a little
[4888.00 - 4893.36] Join your nails and sit like this, you got very disturbed
[4890.68 - 4896.40] If you have cough, cold or any other problem then
[4893.36 - 4897.88] Have you got this or some vitamin?
[4896.40 - 4900.56] If you are suffering from deficiency then you should take multivitamins
[4897.88 - 4904.00] No need to let it sit for 10 minutes to recharge
[4900.56 - 4906.96] This will be the case and if you have a burning sensation in your urine
[4904.00 - 4908.80] So you mix fire and water, fire
[4906.96 - 4910.72] If you merge the earth with yours then you will get your Khaas
[4908.80 - 4912.92] All the colds got cured, my vitamins were fulfilled
[4910.72 - 4915.68] I mixed this and thought I got acidity
[4912.92 - 4917.84] If it is happening too much then look at it
[4915.68 - 4920.84] After doing this, sit down and massage your feet like this
[4917.84 - 4924.72] So do more of these and it starts from here at 90
[4920.84 - 4927.00] so that's why the whole body gets a
[4924.72 - 4930.08] He will tell you how the impact will be from here and that will be huge
[4927.00 - 4932.00] So I told you that you have a pain in your head doctor
[4930.08 - 4936.36] He gives injections and says if you put your hand on the bomb then
[4932.00 - 4939.36] I said, this is where it all goes,
[4936.36 - 4941.80] If you don't believe in Ganga then try this flowing water
[4939.36 - 4944.04] Try it, this thing is very strong
[4941.80 - 4945.08] I sit in the Vajraas and I participate in the ghastly
[4944.04 - 4946.72] Am
[4945.08 - 4948.56] I run to the gudna I have a fracture in my gudna
[4946.72 - 4951.76] Everything has happened with a bandage on
[4948.56 - 4956.12] I got cured from all these injuries in wrestling
[4951.76 - 4957.72] I run, if I run then it means everything
[4956.12 - 4960.72] This is a normal thing when I train
[4957.72 - 4962.28] No, the kids of today who are preparing for Olympics
[4960.72 - 4963.28] He is doing training right, so my warm up
[4962.28 - 4965.84] Up
[4963.28 - 4968.80] I would be training at a very high level
[4965.84 - 4972.84] I am some big guy who does 1200 pushups
[4968.80 - 4975.04] Like something here I will reset you 1200
[4972.84 - 4977.56] I don't do it, I used to do it earlier, but now I
[4975.04 - 4980.08] I do my training separately, now I train two days a week
[4977.56 - 4982.00] Do you know what you learned the day before that?
[4980.08 - 4984.84] Like they rise from behind, without any night
[4982.00 - 4988.44] I get up now, place my hands here and stand up straight
[4984.84 - 4990.64] I become a muscle, now I make my muscle
[4988.44 - 4993.84] Now I will tell you your pet here
[4990.64 - 4996.76] After doing this, I will do self-sufficiency and I will learn nothing.
[4993.84 - 4999.04] hmm you are understanding right i mean i am a little crazy
[4996.76 - 5000.64] I definitely try whatever I see
[4999.04 - 5003.08] and I don't know what my attitude is
[5000.64 - 5005.40] when I go to the mat
[5003.08 - 5007.04] then when
[5005.40 - 5010.56] As long as the person in front of me is not standing, I will stand
[5007.04 - 5014.88] Either I will fall or he will stay
[5010.56 - 5016.44] I will keep on falling but I will try to win or lose
[5014.88 - 5018.44] I don't believe it makes any difference
[5016.44 - 5020.40] what to read or not to read this mind
[5018.44 - 5022.64] I didn't have it earlier because back then the coaches weren't so
[5020.40 - 5025.04] There were some sensible ones when I actually h
[5022.64 - 5026.84] I was in wrestling when I was 20, 22, 25 years old
[5025.04 - 5029.24] If this mind was mine then I would be sure
[5026.84 - 5032.00] I would have gone to the Olympics and won many medals, no matter how many
[5029.24 - 5034.44] When the situation happened then the only thing in mind was that brother
[5032.00 - 5036.76] Represent India and you will get a job
[5034.44 - 5040.04] And this is the mindset that we need to get
[5036.76 - 5042.12] Two Millions of Olympic Probables Now
[5040.04 - 5043.52] I sent a message to Anurag as well
[5042.12 - 5045.28] You have told the Sports Minister many times
[5043.52 - 5048.72] I sent a message that brother we have a lot
[5045.28 - 5051.16] We have all the facilities and plenty of money
[5048.72 - 5053.48] I spent a lot of time, we had good
[5051.16 - 5055.04] I am not educated as a sport psychologist
[5053.48 - 5057.28] Even a man cannot do right, even a player can do right
[5055.04 - 5060.08] I cannot impose that on you, I am a sensible man
[5057.28 - 5061.96] I need someone to help me but everyone is mine
[5060.08 - 5064.92] you live in it you need mind quote
[5061.96 - 5067.16] If you want mind quote then you want mind guru
[5064.92 - 5068.72] Things happen when a bird fights with another bird
[5067.16 - 5071.96] If it is possible then brother, still all these
[5068.72 - 5074.12] The players are right, we wish that
[5071.96 - 5077.20] This time go to Olympics and win lots of medals
