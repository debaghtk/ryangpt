[182.44 - 188.52] increased in their um about half of the
[186.96 - 190.80] genes were actually increased in the
[188.52 - 193.32] activity whilst the other half were
[190.80 - 196.84] decreased the genes that were Switched
[193.32 - 199.36] Off by a lack of sleep were genes
[196.84 - 202.04] associated with the immune system which
[199.36 - 204.92] means cough cold fever always falling

[253.72 - 257.68] Shane I just saw you at Wimbleton and
[255.84 - 260.76] you were intering at Wimbledon how was
[257.68 - 263.24] the experience it was incredible Ryan I
[260.76 - 265.92] was at Wimbledon this past couple of
[263.24 - 268.24] weeks ago and then at the the PGA Tour
[265.92 - 270.88] Europe in Scotland as well because I
[268.24 - 273.92] work with the PGA as well as some tennis
[270.88 - 276.76] players it was just amazing to go behind
[273.92 - 279.80] the scenes and look at all these Elite
[276.76 - 282.84] tennis players and see their practices
[279.80 - 285.80] and gave one of my books to Novak's team
[282.84 - 289.48] as well Mike Brian I've worked with him
[285.80 - 291.16] for a while and he's been fantastic he
[289.48 - 293.68] he loves the work that I do I helped him
[291.16 - 295.28] with his sleep as well so he said hey
[293.68 - 297.76] why don't you join me to wimble and it
[295.28 - 299.80] was just an such a privilege and a great
[297.76 - 301.36] blessing to be a a part of that Holy
[299.80 - 303.84] experience hopefully next time you can
[301.36 - 305.48] join me I think I will I will join you
[303.84 - 308.92] next time and you know today's world
[305.48 - 312.64] brain health day let's start off at few
[308.92 - 314.84] simple questions why the brain is the
[312.64 - 317.36] most important organ in the human body
[314.84 - 319.64] you know as as a doctor you study the
[317.36 - 322.72] brain better than most of us and you
[319.64 - 325.68] actually treat people based on um you
[322.72 - 327.12] know their deficiencies in the brain and
[325.68 - 329.88] now you've written this book called Peak
[327.12 - 332.80] sleep performance for athletes now both
[329.88 - 334.52] me and you deal with high performing
[332.80 - 336.88] individuals which are athletes
[334.52 - 340.00] celebrities rock stars millionaires
[336.88 - 343.44] billionaires and they pay a lot of focus
[340.00 - 345.32] on their brain health so why the brain
[343.44 - 347.52] why should everyone watching in today on
[345.32 - 349.76] this Live begin to start not with a
[347.52 - 352.16] weight loss program not begin to start
[349.76 - 355.32] with a fat burner why should they focus
[352.16 - 358.04] first on the brain the brain is a
[355.32 - 361.28] command center right it it determines
[358.04 - 363.08] everything we do and if the brain isn't
[361.28 - 365.48] healthy we're not healthy and if our
[363.08 - 367.40] body is not healthy our brain is not
[365.48 - 369.72] healthy so as you know I worked with
[367.40 - 372.44] Doctor Daniel Layman and we do the brain
[369.72 - 375.48] spec images and we know all the risk
[372.44 - 378.80] factors for brain health and your role
[375.48 - 380.80] is indispensable when it comes to brain
[378.80 - 382.08] health because if your body isn't
[380.80 - 383.92] healthy if you're not getting the right
[382.08 - 386.24] nutrition your brain isn't going to
[383.92 - 387.20] function well we talk about the brain
[386.24 - 390.08] and
[387.20 - 393.32] neurotransmitters we talk about the fact
[390.08 - 394.64] that guess what the gut produces 75% of
[393.32 - 397.12] those
[394.64 - 400.12] neurotransmitters ration gut the gut
[397.12 - 402.68] produces 75% of those neurotransmitters
[400.12 - 404.84] so whoever's eaten whoever's eaten bad
[402.68 - 407.92] on the weekend is going to have a crappy
[404.84 - 409.40] Monday morning technically 100% I wonder
[407.92 - 411.72] how many of our listeners today are
[409.40 - 414.60] having a crappy Monday morning because
[411.72 - 418.48] their nutrition wasn't right and that
[414.60 - 420.88] leads into good quality sleep as well so
[418.48 - 423.52] the gut and the brain that gut brain
[420.88 - 425.68] axis is so critical for every one of the
[423.52 - 427.92] folks we work with as you rightly said
[425.68 - 429.60] whether they're billionaires or regular
[427.92 - 432.32] stay-at-home moms or whether they're
[429.60 - 435.56] Elite athletes the gut needs to work
[432.32 - 439.80] right you're fueling your brain as Dr
[435.56 - 441.80] Daniel says would you put sugar in the
[439.80 - 443.64] gas tank of your Ferrari well you're
[441.80 - 446.72] worth more than a Ferrari why would you
[443.64 - 448.64] do that with your own brain awesome
[446.72 - 450.20] awesome so we've understood that the
[448.64 - 452.60] neurotransmitter because the brain
[450.20 - 455.72] chemistry is really really important so
[452.60 - 459.28] for from my perspective over here um I
[455.72 - 461.64] wanted to know when you talk about sleep
[459.28 - 463.16] do we need to go to sleep early because
[461.64 - 465.76] in your in your book you talk about the
[463.16 - 467.32] importance of sleep right and I really
[465.76 - 468.76] love your book because I keep it in my
[467.32 - 471.00] counseling room and I quote it to
[468.76 - 473.88] athletes and then there's this great one
[471.00 - 476.04] where there's a lack of sleep and Tennis
[473.88 - 478.72] accuracy shots go down by
[476.04 - 480.28] 9.2% so somebody asked us a question
[478.72 - 482.40] just now live
[480.28 - 484.60] is it okay if I get 8 hours of sleep but
[482.40 - 487.56] any time of the the day like you know
[484.60 - 489.28] these are call center workers and people
[487.56 - 492.88] um who probably will not go to bed at
[489.28 - 496.52] 9:00 at night or 10:00 at night so from
[492.88 - 500.00] from that perspective yeah so it goes
[496.52 - 503.04] into timing of sleep and the amount of
[500.00 - 506.36] sleep and the quality of sleep each of
[503.04 - 508.84] those individual things need to come
[506.36 - 511.00] together so the timing of sleep you
[508.84 - 512.64] can't help it if you're a shift worker
[511.00 - 515.76] if you're working at a call center
[512.64 - 517.88] strange hours but what you can do is
[515.76 - 520.68] lock in the other two aspects of sleep
[517.88 - 522.56] if the timing is messed up the amount of
[520.68 - 524.92] sleep that you're getting and the
[522.56 - 528.20] quality of that sleep so if you're
[524.92 - 531.20] waking up refreshed a okay if you're not
[528.20 - 533.60] waking up refreshed it's not normal a
[531.20 - 537.20] lot of people think it's a norm to not
[533.60 - 540.08] wake up refresh that's a problem so how
[537.20 - 542.76] many hours of sleep do you need let's
[540.08 - 545.20] dispel the notion of hours of sleep
[542.76 - 548.20] let's think about sleep
[545.20 - 551.64] cycles sleep cyle what what are sleep
[548.20 - 554.76] cycles doctor sleep cycles are well deep
[551.64 - 556.76] sleep and dream sleep together you cycle
[554.76 - 560.00] through deep and dream sleep it's
[556.76 - 563.04] usually 90 minutes so if I have five
[560.00 - 565.88] cycles of 90 minutes each that's s and a
[563.04 - 568.12] half hours in a night for an average
[565.88 - 571.08] adult like me I'm not an elite athlete
[568.12 - 573.52] training for six or eight hours each day
[571.08 - 576.08] s and a half hours of good quality sleep
[573.52 - 577.68] is my sweet spot so are you saying are
[576.08 - 579.36] you saying that athletes and sorry to
[577.68 - 581.84] keep interrupting you because there so
[579.36 - 584.00] many questions coming off on my platform
[581.84 - 586.20] are you saying that the athletes need
[584.00 - 587.32] more sleep than the common person like
[586.20 - 590.12] you and
[587.32 - 592.40] me% and but but they all sleeping seven
[590.12 - 594.76] and eight hours like us normal people I
[592.40 - 597.40] want how how many of them qualifi to the
[594.76 - 600.44] Paris Olympics then this year and so
[597.40 - 602.80] they need to sleep more 100%
[600.44 - 604.48] 100% because the so coming back to your
[602.80 - 606.76] two cycles the sleep and dream and you
[604.48 - 609.72] went five Cycles please continue on that
[606.76 - 611.92] so five cycles of sleep is Right 7 and a
[609.72 - 614.12] half hours of sleep a lot of my athletes
[611.92 - 617.40] that went to Paris this year they're
[614.12 - 620.40] getting you know seven eight cycles of
[617.40 - 623.76] of of sleep which is around 9 and a half
[620.40 - 625.60] 10 10 and a half some some of them 12
[623.76 - 627.36] hours of sleep in a 24hour period
[625.60 - 629.72] because if you're training for 6 to 8
[627.36 - 632.32] hours you need that recover recovery
[629.72 - 634.40] sleep it's critical for your recovery
[632.32 - 637.08] your inflammation reduction your
[634.40 - 639.64] reaction times your brain to flush out
[637.08 - 642.24] the toxins it build up while we're awake
[639.64 - 645.64] all this is super important kids kids
[642.24 - 648.08] need more sleep and Adolescence and on
[645.64 - 651.80] average need around nine hours of sleep
[648.08 - 654.20] 1% of the population may need six hours
[651.80 - 656.40] or less of sleep so some people say I
[654.20 - 658.60] can get away with just five hours of
[656.40 - 661.00] sleep four hours of sleep I'm good if
[658.60 - 666.08] you're in the 1% of the population God
[661.00 - 668.12] bless you lucky you great but 99% chance
[666.08 - 671.36] you're not in that
[668.12 - 674.80] 1% wonderful so um when we're talking
[671.36 - 677.04] about this um in in terms of anxiety I
[674.80 - 680.32] recently read a study saying that
[677.04 - 684.88] somewhere in prisons uh they gave the
[680.32 - 687.56] prisoners more amount of omega3 and a
[684.88 - 690.12] multivitamin uh specifically the B
[687.56 - 693.00] complexes so I was just reading up on
[690.12 - 695.88] how the MTHFR Gene when there's a lack
[693.00 - 699.28] of methy folate it's a Cascade effect
[695.88 - 702.00] into depression anxiety so when I hear
[699.28 - 703.96] people or read on the newspaper that so
[702.00 - 706.56] and so so and so jumped out of a balcony
[703.96 - 708.88] or committed suicide or students under
[706.56 - 711.88] so much of pressure I'm scratching my
[708.88 - 714.04] head and thinking could it be that
[711.88 - 715.88] there's a nutritional deficiency could
[714.04 - 718.12] it be that you're not sleeping enough
[715.88 - 720.48] and therefore slamming your brain and
[718.12 - 722.04] not getting the necessary Rejuvenation
[720.48 - 723.16] so what's your opinion as a board
[722.04 - 727.12] certified
[723.16 - 729.72] psychiatrist you're 100% right Ryan so
[727.12 - 731.52] as we mentioned earlier the gut and the
[729.72 - 734.36] neurotransmitters the gut needs to
[731.52 - 736.76] remain healthy the four most important
[734.36 - 739.20] bacteria in the gut produce a large
[736.76 - 740.92] amount of the B vitamins that's why
[739.20 - 743.60] pregnant women are given B vitamins
[740.92 - 746.52] growing children are given B vitamins
[743.60 - 748.80] now vitamin D is needed by these
[746.52 - 750.96] bacteria to produce vitamin the B
[748.80 - 753.32] vitamin so vitamin D is critical for
[750.96 - 755.60] brain health and the B vitamins are
[753.32 - 758.84] critical for nervous system development
[755.60 - 760.88] namely brain spinal cord nerves and also
[758.84 - 763.20] some of the B vitamins are needed for
[760.88 - 767.08] your body to make
[763.20 - 769.20] serotonin adrenaline and dopamine so if
[767.08 - 771.72] you're lacking the B vitamins or your
[769.20 - 774.08] gut is imbalanced with unhealthy
[771.72 - 776.04] bacteria how will you produce enough B
[774.08 - 778.20] vitamins which are needed for nervous
[776.04 - 780.60] system brain development as well as
[778.20 - 782.48] blood cell development for delivering
[780.60 - 786.24] oxygen to the vital organs like the
[782.48 - 789.00] brain and the Heart critically important
[786.24 - 792.72] so you know I work with a lot of CEOs
[789.00 - 794.60] CFOs business people and all uh does you
[792.72 - 796.40] know you mentioned 1% of the population
[794.60 - 798.28] sleeps 5 hours or lesser and all and
[796.40 - 799.56] they're like bragging about it and all
[798.28 - 801.24] and so we see that some of these rich
[799.56 - 804.00] people like I can get by with four hours
[801.24 - 805.44] of sleep especially you guys doctors
[804.00 - 807.12] you'll go through Medical College
[805.44 - 809.48] thinking you can sleep on four and five
[807.12 - 811.60] hours I'm sure you when you meet your
[809.48 - 813.08] classmates uh you know you have you have
[811.60 - 817.64] to like tell them dude you need more
[813.08 - 820.76] sleep but um does this sleep deprivation
[817.64 - 823.20] uh influence the brain's reward system
[820.76 - 824.76] and decision making
[823.20 - 827.68] process
[824.76 - 830.64] 100% And many different ways this
[827.68 - 833.80] happens so we know that on the brain
[830.64 - 836.60] scans with the m clinics when you get
[833.80 - 838.76] less sleep the frontal loes don't work
[836.60 - 841.36] properly they kind of shut down well
[838.76 - 844.20] what is they do they help us with
[841.36 - 847.56] decision making rational decisions
[844.20 - 850.84] suppressing impulsive or irrational rash
[847.56 - 854.92] decisions they help us with motivation
[850.84 - 856.76] Drive Joy pleasure social
[854.92 - 858.64] connectedness they're kind of like the
[856.76 - 860.52] breaks of the brain as well so they put
[858.64 - 862.76] the breaks on the emotional
[860.52 - 864.96] overreactions and they also help us with
[862.76 - 867.60] processing speed how quickly your brain
[864.96 - 869.64] assimilates information processes that
[867.60 - 873.56] information your
[869.64 - 876.44] ability to sustain attention multitask
[873.56 - 879.84] higher level executive functioning so
[876.44 - 883.04] essentially with sleep deprivation your
[879.84 - 885.44] dopamine levels drop your brain thinks
[883.04 - 888.24] it's going into survival mode or danger
[885.44 - 891.52] mode your brain will essentially be
[888.24 - 893.32] emotionally hijacked and you'll be more
[891.52 - 896.16] reactive less
[893.32 - 898.28] responsive so as a CEO as a high
[896.16 - 899.60] functioning individual as an elite
[898.28 - 902.00] athlete
[899.60 - 904.00] it's like a chess game right you're not
[902.00 - 906.52] going to be on top of your game when
[904.00 - 908.72] your frontal lobe is shutting down with
[906.52 - 911.28] less dopamine and then with less
[908.72 - 915.00] dopamine you're going to want to fuel
[911.28 - 917.76] that dopamine in other unhealthy ways
[915.00 - 920.72] that's why sleep deprivation has also
[917.76 - 922.52] been shown to be associated with
[920.72 - 925.56] addiction
[922.52 - 927.56] relapses food cravings and then you'll
[925.56 - 929.32] run to the sugar because that's as
[927.56 - 933.16] addictive more addictive than Co
[929.32 - 937.12] according to a study
[933.16 - 939.04] wow that's right you know in your book
[937.12 - 943.44] in your book you wrote one part which
[939.04 - 946.56] kind of set with me which was um uh if
[943.44 - 948.96] you have a night of bad sleep um there's
[946.56 - 951.56] a part of your brain where up to 40% of
[948.96 - 953.32] your uh reasoning or processing power
[951.56 - 954.92] decision making goes down so now
[953.32 - 956.36] whenever I have to sit on my board
[954.92 - 959.44] meetings and go through multiple
[956.36 - 961.60] department meetings I make sure I switch
[959.44 - 963.48] off Netflix I make sure I go to sleep
[961.60 - 965.80] early because I have to be in that
[963.48 - 968.08] meeting for 8 n hours continuously
[965.80 - 970.48] focused you know and so it's very
[968.08 - 973.40] important but Dr Shane are there any
[970.48 - 976.80] stories that you have without taking
[973.40 - 979.28] names of where you have changed the
[976.80 - 981.96] athletes Behavior or your clients
[979.28 - 984.20] behavior and you have seen um an
[981.96 - 987.44] absolute change in their personality or
[984.20 - 991.68] character because you're focused on
[987.44 - 993.56] sleep example is examples Ryan um one
[991.68 - 997.64] one example that that really stood out
[993.56 - 1000.64] to me was this uh guy who was having a
[997.64 - 1002.80] night eating disorder so his uh wife
[1000.64 - 1006.96] wanted to divorce him because every
[1002.80 - 1008.88] night he was eating he was wasn't aware
[1006.96 - 1011.24] he was asleep he was going to the
[1008.88 - 1013.56] kitchen eating a bunch of food making a
[1011.24 - 1015.40] terrible mess the food in the bed food
[1013.56 - 1017.80] crumbs between the kitchen and the
[1015.40 - 1019.92] bedroom she's waking up with curry and
[1017.80 - 1023.32] food in the bed and she's like I'm done
[1019.92 - 1027.04] with this this is bad this has to stop
[1023.32 - 1030.24] and this guy had severe anxiety and PTSD
[1027.04 - 1032.60] he had been in a war zone and so he had
[1030.24 - 1036.04] horrible nightmares he was snoring he
[1032.60 - 1039.08] was in his early 40s and I said well you
[1036.04 - 1041.72] know he's a young guy he's not fat but I
[1039.08 - 1043.20] still want to Des him for sleep apnea so
[1041.72 - 1046.60] Des him for sleep
[1043.20 - 1050.92] apneia he was stopping breathing 108
[1046.60 - 1053.56] times an hour wow really s sleep apnea
[1050.92 - 1055.80] right and we know that sleep apnea your
[1053.56 - 1059.00] brains cannot get enough oxygen it goes
[1055.80 - 1061.92] into anxiety mode that triggers anxiety
[1059.00 - 1064.36] and waking up out of deep sleep that can
[1061.92 - 1066.96] result in sleep eating so I said let's
[1064.36 - 1069.44] first treat the sleep apnea properly we
[1066.96 - 1071.28] know what it is let's get a good seat PA
[1069.44 - 1074.72] machine Let's get the right pressures
[1071.28 - 1077.16] going let's resolve that as a first step
[1074.72 - 1079.52] you know what happened he stopped night
[1077.16 - 1083.20] eating his marriage was saved wow he
[1079.52 - 1087.04] lost 40 lb 40 lb of weight reduction
[1083.20 - 1090.88] within 8 weeks because he wasn't 0 thing
[1087.04 - 1093.36] anymore because every yeah you're saying
[1090.88 - 1096.00] that people who are not losing weight is
[1093.36 - 1098.92] also related to sleep oh
[1096.00 - 1102.28] 100% that's so important in your work as
[1098.92 - 1105.24] well right so the brain thinks for every
[1102.28 - 1107.60] four hours of sleep that you don't get
[1105.24 - 1110.12] your brain thinks it needs to eat 900
[1107.60 - 1113.00] more calories say that again say that
[1110.12 - 1116.12] again we got to clip this for every four
[1113.00 - 1119.28] hours of sleep hours of less sleep that
[1116.12 - 1123.00] you get your brain thinks it needs 900
[1119.28 - 1124.36] more calories to consume that so that
[1123.00 - 1127.32] would
[1124.36 - 1129.88] explain why sometimes I've got the
[1127.32 - 1132.68] perfect diet to my clients but they're
[1129.88 - 1134.20] not losing weight because I've gone on a
[1132.68 - 1135.48] calorie deficit diet but the next day
[1134.20 - 1139.08] the body just telling them you need to
[1135.48 - 1140.68] eat 900 calories more exactly and even
[1139.08 - 1143.56] if they're on a ketogenic diet there a
[1140.68 - 1145.24] good reason why you need carb cycling in
[1143.56 - 1148.12] some folks right I mean you're the
[1145.24 - 1151.28] expert in this area but the hormones are
[1148.12 - 1154.36] The Gatekeepers of the cells so if your
[1151.28 - 1157.16] sleep isn't optimized your brain will
[1154.36 - 1160.36] body will go into survival mode survival
[1157.16 - 1162.80] mode means more stress hormone cortisol
[1160.36 - 1167.04] cortisol will start storing everything
[1162.80 - 1170.44] is fat and we know our fat cells convert
[1167.04 - 1174.04] testosterone to estrogen so instead of
[1170.44 - 1176.56] building muscle you're losing muscle and
[1174.04 - 1179.68] building fat with the healthy diets you
[1176.56 - 1184.12] may lay out for your clients so leptin
[1179.68 - 1187.00] which suppresses appetite goes down gin
[1184.12 - 1189.32] which makes you hungrier goes up
[1187.00 - 1193.88] testosterone which builds muscle goes
[1189.32 - 1197.32] down cortisol which builds fat goes
[1193.88 - 1200.00] up wow wow so that was technical so for
[1197.32 - 1202.00] the lay man out there listening both
[1200.00 - 1204.84] certified psychiatrist and sleep
[1202.00 - 1207.56] coaching doctor has said this for four
[1204.84 - 1209.72] hours of left lesser sleep you need 900
[1207.56 - 1211.88] calories your body consumes 900 calories
[1209.72 - 1213.36] more and that's where you're not being
[1211.88 - 1215.96] able to lose weight so I think this goes
[1213.36 - 1218.28] out to all the women out there um who
[1215.96 - 1221.12] are you know on social media into late
[1218.28 - 1222.88] night Netflix and stuff like that and
[1221.12 - 1225.72] speaking of the elephant in the room for
[1222.88 - 1229.08] children and for even you and me uh
[1225.72 - 1231.44] social media Netflix um is it correlated
[1229.08 - 1234.00] to the modern day ages mental health
[1231.44 - 1237.08] issues um are you seeing a relationship
[1234.00 - 1238.88] of children uh not being able able to
[1237.08 - 1241.16] perform well because they're just hooked
[1238.88 - 1243.04] onto social media and one is the hooking
[1241.16 - 1245.32] to social media and the other is social
[1243.04 - 1247.72] media eating away your sleep time there
[1245.32 - 1251.72] are two departments so like for my son I
[1247.72 - 1253.80] kind of try and limit his interaction on
[1251.72 - 1256.08] uh the internet as much as possible to 1
[1253.80 - 1258.76] hour one and a half hour a day at 11
[1256.08 - 1261.00] years of age but tell us as parents tell
[1258.76 - 1264.04] us as individuals how much do we need to
[1261.00 - 1266.64] do a digital detox on a daily basis oh
[1264.04 - 1268.68] that that is crucial Ryan a digital
[1266.64 - 1271.16] detox because people only think about oh
[1268.68 - 1272.76] light exposure but it's way more than
[1271.16 - 1275.56] that there was a really good documentary
[1272.76 - 1278.96] called the social dilemma which tells us
[1275.56 - 1282.56] about how social media essentially
[1278.96 - 1284.56] hijacks your brain and especially the
[1282.56 - 1287.24] youth are the most vulnerable people
[1284.56 - 1289.68] like you know I got my first cell phone
[1287.24 - 1291.80] when I was 18 years years old it had a
[1289.68 - 1294.72] little digital screen like a dig digital
[1291.80 - 1296.92] watch years later I had a duck screen
[1294.72 - 1298.76] and all this fancy stuff social media
[1296.92 - 1300.20] wasn't a thing even this Instagram that
[1298.76 - 1302.72] were're on I didn't have it a few years
[1300.20 - 1305.52] ago but now the kids the teenagers
[1302.72 - 1308.04] adolescence all are on social media so
[1305.52 - 1311.88] one thing is is that it's designed to
[1308.04 - 1315.80] hook us in with that hit of immediate
[1311.88 - 1317.48] gratification the dopamine hit pleasure
[1315.80 - 1319.40] pleasure pleasure press the button it's
[1317.48 - 1322.20] like a gambling thing the same
[1319.40 - 1324.80] principles for gambling addiction apply
[1322.20 - 1327.40] to social media addiction and that's a
[1324.80 - 1330.04] big problem because you can constantly
[1327.40 - 1332.56] need that high and crave that and you go
[1330.04 - 1335.20] back to the social media then you start
[1332.56 - 1337.60] taking things literally not only that is
[1335.20 - 1340.72] going to mess with your sleep the other
[1337.60 - 1343.32] factor is because we're looking for this
[1340.72 - 1345.20] external validation constantly oh this
[1343.32 - 1346.88] person has such a great life this person
[1345.20 - 1348.68] you don't know how miserable they really
[1346.88 - 1351.20] are they're showing it because because
[1348.68 - 1355.00] they want that ego boost they want that
[1351.20 - 1357.16] external validation to say oh this I
[1355.00 - 1358.84] know some people are liking my post so
[1357.16 - 1361.64] obviously I I have a good life although
[1358.84 - 1363.52] I'm miserable so if you're relying too
[1361.64 - 1366.92] much on external
[1363.52 - 1369.00] validation external bow if you will
[1366.92 - 1371.12] what's going to happen is that where is
[1369.00 - 1373.24] that internal sense going to develop how
[1371.12 - 1375.40] will you develop internally then you're
[1373.24 - 1376.84] going to be like a feather in the wind
[1375.40 - 1378.64] or someone says something bad to you
[1376.84 - 1379.88] it's going to affect you terribly
[1378.64 - 1381.48] someone says something good to you
[1379.88 - 1383.52] you'll believe them then you'll be
[1381.48 - 1385.48] surrounded by yes people who only don't
[1383.52 - 1387.60] want to say anything negative to you and
[1385.48 - 1391.24] you'll kind of go down the wrong path
[1387.60 - 1394.08] instead of self- learning growth purpose
[1391.24 - 1397.36] meaning you'll be focusing only on the
[1394.08 - 1399.44] immediate gratification of external
[1397.36 - 1403.92] validation and that's not going to
[1399.44 - 1407.08] promote growth or self-discovery and
[1403.92 - 1409.16] self-development okay um there are a lot
[1407.08 - 1411.76] of questions coming in
[1409.16 - 1414.72] and uh rudra and
[1411.76 - 1418.24] prates different people are asking even
[1414.72 - 1420.92] Rashi is asking how to sleep peacefully
[1418.24 - 1423.96] without any nightmares or any thoughts
[1420.92 - 1427.52] so when we close our eyes uh then we are
[1423.96 - 1431.00] stressed out about yeah this happened
[1427.52 - 1434.00] today and I also face it a lot of times
[1431.00 - 1439.88] especially when um the the week I've not
[1434.00 - 1439.88] been able to um get forward
[1442.56 - 1447.56] Shane who is a sleep specialist and all
[1445.36 - 1451.08] of us all Ryan Fernando's fans and
[1447.56 - 1452.72] Instagram live followers right now um we
[1451.08 - 1454.72] we're counseling with Dr Shane and we
[1452.72 - 1456.84] ask Dr Shane Dr Shane give us a perfect
[1454.72 - 1459.48] schedule give us some tips of what we
[1456.84 - 1462.72] should be doing um to get better sleep
[1459.48 - 1465.52] and have better brain health 100% so
[1462.72 - 1468.52] peaceful sleep huh that that's a a lofty
[1465.52 - 1471.76] goal Marcus Aurelius the famous stoic
[1468.52 - 1473.44] used to manage the Empire of Rome and
[1471.76 - 1476.12] then go back to his Chambers but he
[1473.44 - 1479.04] wouldn't go to sleep immediately Ryan he
[1476.12 - 1481.88] would have what you know we could now in
[1479.04 - 1484.44] today's terms call a daily download he
[1481.88 - 1485.48] would chill out sit down think about the
[1484.44 - 1489.16] days
[1485.48 - 1491.44] happenings and I learned this this trick
[1489.16 - 1494.36] from you know feder's Roger feder's
[1491.44 - 1497.92] mindset after a point where he won or
[1494.36 - 1499.60] lost it here's a 15sec Rule 5 Seconds
[1497.92 - 1502.72] he'll take think about how that point
[1499.60 - 1507.24] went if you lost it or a terrible lost
[1502.72 - 1510.60] it no problem 5 Seconds of I'm now in
[1507.24 - 1512.80] the present moment that's that's dead
[1510.60 - 1515.44] and the next 5 seconds is planning for
[1512.80 - 1517.44] the next point so remaining in the
[1515.44 - 1519.64] moment there's an ancient saying that
[1517.44 - 1521.68] says if you're stuck in the past you're
[1519.64 - 1523.52] depressed if you're worried about the
[1521.68 - 1526.64] future you're anxious but if you're in
[1523.52 - 1529.16] the present moment you're at peace and
[1526.64 - 1531.28] we have busy brains busy lives we're
[1529.16 - 1534.36] always on our phones there's no time for
[1531.28 - 1538.20] us to process all the information that's
[1534.36 - 1539.96] been hitting us all day so unfortunately
[1538.20 - 1542.52] when we're lying in bed that's the only
[1539.96 - 1544.76] time we're not on our gadgets hopefully
[1542.52 - 1547.72] that's when all the stuff cut starts
[1544.76 - 1550.36] coming to the surface so the first rule
[1547.72 - 1551.96] is your brain is not a light bulb it's
[1550.36 - 1555.40] not going to switch off immediately when
[1551.96 - 1558.36] you wanted to so spend 30 to 60 minutes
[1555.40 - 1560.96] before your bedtime writing down your
[1558.36 - 1563.52] Worry List from that day maybe
[1560.96 - 1565.24] journaling writing down your Todo list
[1563.52 - 1567.04] for the next day so you're not thinking
[1565.24 - 1572.08] about those things are I'll forget this
[1567.04 - 1574.76] or that in bed so meditation is key for
[1572.08 - 1577.48] calming the nervous system down yoga
[1574.76 - 1581.04] Nitra is amazing as well for that
[1577.48 - 1583.24] purpose so have a nice winding down
[1581.04 - 1586.00] routine where there journaling your
[1583.24 - 1589.92] to-do list your Worry List meditation a
[1586.00 - 1592.08] warm shower dim lights no activating
[1589.92 - 1595.76] stressful conversations with your wife
[1592.08 - 1597.28] or no stressful interactions or don't
[1595.76 - 1598.92] put on the news if you're look looking
[1597.28 - 1601.72] at bad news and most of the time it's
[1598.92 - 1603.88] sensationalist anyway so why bother with
[1601.72 - 1605.96] that it's not an emergency there's no
[1603.88 - 1609.28] Cyclone coming to your doorstep every
[1605.96 - 1611.64] night so if you have a nice winding down
[1609.28 - 1613.76] routine your brain will start saying
[1611.64 - 1617.60] okay I'm supposed to be getting ready
[1613.76 - 1620.92] for sleep time protect your sleep time
[1617.60 - 1623.68] as a mini vacation every single night
[1620.92 - 1626.96] could you repeat that protect your sleep
[1623.68 - 1629.60] time as a mini vacation every night
[1626.96 - 1632.56] exact what do you mean by that I mean
[1629.60 - 1635.16] that people want to plan vacations one
[1632.56 - 1640.04] year in advance six month months in
[1635.16 - 1643.24] advance look forward to your sleep time
[1640.04 - 1645.52] from the time you wake up that is your
[1643.24 - 1647.84] many vacation it you need to protect it
[1645.52 - 1648.72] as your mini vacation each 24-hour
[1647.84 - 1650.84] period
[1648.72 - 1653.16] I'm going to start doing that from to
[1650.84 - 1655.04] I'm going to start doing that today I'm
[1653.16 - 1657.28] like yeah I'm getting on my vacation I'm
[1655.04 - 1661.88] going to go to sleep at 10 o'cl tonight
[1657.28 - 1665.72] so um see speaking of taking a mini
[1661.88 - 1668.32] vacation so can the brain get any
[1665.72 - 1671.00] benefits by engaging in any new
[1668.32 - 1673.00] cognitive activity or challenging
[1671.00 - 1675.76] activities like maybe learning a new
[1673.00 - 1678.68] language or playing a musical
[1675.76 - 1681.64] instrument 100%
[1678.68 - 1684.00] so challenging the brain putting it out
[1681.64 - 1686.36] of its comfort zone
[1684.00 - 1687.72] stimulates brain development what we
[1686.36 - 1689.84] call
[1687.72 - 1691.60] neuroplasticity now we see this in
[1689.84 - 1693.96] speech therapy we see this in
[1691.60 - 1697.32] physiotherapy as well if someone is at a
[1693.96 - 1700.24] stroke we're stimulating different areas
[1697.32 - 1702.04] of the brain to take up different tasks
[1700.24 - 1706.56] research has shown there's a part of the
[1702.04 - 1710.68] brain called the anterior mid singulate
[1706.56 - 1713.92] gyrus which increases in size the more
[1710.68 - 1717.08] challenging tasks you're engaging in now
[1713.92 - 1719.64] the normal thing we do is avoid anything
[1717.08 - 1721.64] that's challenging we avoid stressful
[1719.64 - 1723.96] things we avoid things that are
[1721.64 - 1727.80] difficult to do we want the easiest way
[1723.96 - 1730.72] forward but that doesn't stimulate brain
[1727.80 - 1733.00] growth people always say brain is a
[1730.72 - 1735.68] muscle so you think you're going to
[1733.00 - 1738.28] build muscle and and become an elite
[1735.68 - 1740.32] athlete by sitting on the couch eating
[1738.28 - 1743.00] potato fries
[1740.32 - 1744.40] no that's that's so true you know we
[1743.00 - 1746.84] need to challenge the brain and get it
[1744.40 - 1749.48] to somewhere that's the one you said is
[1746.84 - 1752.44] take a mini vacation another advice is
[1749.48 - 1754.64] challenge your brain um maybe have some
[1752.44 - 1757.00] car yeah simple ways to challenge your
[1754.64 - 1758.92] brain right Ryan so I can drive to work
[1757.00 - 1761.68] the same way each day or I can try a
[1758.92 - 1763.44] different route why use your GPS when
[1761.68 - 1766.48] when you may have a good sense of where
[1763.44 - 1768.56] a place might be don't use your GPS that
[1766.48 - 1771.32] day find a different route to to work
[1768.56 - 1774.24] maybe try and find something new each
[1771.32 - 1777.40] day have what you might call a nightly
[1774.24 - 1779.24] treasure hunt before going to bed think
[1777.40 - 1781.32] about something unique that happened
[1779.24 - 1783.72] that day or try and remember a sequence
[1781.32 - 1785.24] of events or decide you want to walk
[1783.72 - 1787.32] around your neighborhood and find a
[1785.24 - 1789.72] store or a coffee shop you haven't seen
[1787.32 - 1793.12] before stimulating your brain in
[1789.72 - 1795.76] different ways strengthens the neuronal
[1793.12 - 1797.04] connections and stimulates different
[1795.76 - 1801.32] neural
[1797.04 - 1803.72] networks so basically um somebody just
[1801.32 - 1807.08] asked this question sir I experience
[1803.72 - 1810.60] pain in the head after eating sugar so
[1807.08 - 1813.04] the head is your department so any
[1810.60 - 1814.84] inputs on whether when somebody's eating
[1813.04 - 1816.68] sugar I mean the first thing I would say
[1814.84 - 1818.92] is don't eat it because your brain is
[1816.68 - 1821.88] telling you not to eat it but what do
[1818.92 - 1823.80] you think as a doctor you're right right
[1821.88 - 1826.28] and you know this better than I do
[1823.80 - 1829.76] you're you're you're a world renown
[1826.28 - 1833.00] nutritionist that's sugar is toxic to
[1829.76 - 1835.44] the brains and whether it's just plain
[1833.00 - 1837.24] sugar or whether it's candy with colors
[1835.44 - 1839.72] that may be adversely affecting our
[1837.24 - 1842.56] brain we know that some folks are more
[1839.72 - 1844.16] sensitive than others to certain things
[1842.56 - 1847.24] so if you're even more sensitive to
[1844.16 - 1849.44] sugar and you have a headache migraines
[1847.24 - 1852.12] are a form of you know the nervous
[1849.44 - 1854.96] system going into overdrive or
[1852.12 - 1857.56] inflammation triggering those the
[1854.96 - 1859.60] sensitive nerve endings it's a sign that
[1857.56 - 1862.00] you might be more sensitive to sugar
[1859.60 - 1864.32] than the average person and you're right
[1862.00 - 1866.56] listen to your brain it's telling you
[1864.32 - 1868.16] what's right and what's wrong for it you
[1866.56 - 1870.32] know both of us were cricketers and you
[1868.16 - 1872.20] were at the other end and I was on the
[1870.32 - 1874.40] other side batting I would say that come
[1872.20 - 1876.56] up to you and say Dr Shane um you know
[1874.40 - 1879.16] maybe also uh you know certain people
[1876.56 - 1882.36] are allergic like if I drink sugar can
[1879.16 - 1884.04] juice my sinuses get clogged my sinuses
[1882.36 - 1887.16] get clogged it puts pressure on the back
[1884.04 - 1889.36] of my eyeballs so a food allergy test
[1887.16 - 1892.20] sometimes helps people people and the
[1889.36 - 1894.20] source of sugar could also be the
[1892.20 - 1896.56] trigger sugar in itself is the the the
[1894.20 - 1898.04] glucose Spike that that arrives with
[1896.56 - 1899.80] that the brain might just not be able to
[1898.04 - 1904.32] be one of those brains that handle a
[1899.80 - 1907.56] heavy load but um speaking of foods um
[1904.32 - 1908.52] do you advise people to avoid any foods
[1907.56 - 1912.76] before
[1908.52 - 1917.88] bedtime yes so typically a rule of thumb
[1912.76 - 1920.84] is avoid any meals 2 hours or or close
[1917.88 - 1923.24] closer to bedtime only because some
[1920.84 - 1925.92] people say 3 hours I say 2 hours only
[1923.24 - 1927.92] because it takes time to digest the food
[1925.92 - 1930.00] when your body is digesting food your
[1927.92 - 1932.24] heart rate goes up more blood flow goes
[1930.00 - 1934.24] to the gut if your heart rate is
[1932.24 - 1936.64] elevated if your body temperature is
[1934.24 - 1938.96] elevated it's harder for your body to
[1936.64 - 1941.24] come down and fall fall asleep that's
[1938.96 - 1942.92] one another thing is if you're eating
[1941.24 - 1945.44] too close to bedtime and you're lying
[1942.92 - 1947.16] down you might have some reflux and it
[1945.44 - 1949.36] might cause some heartburn and
[1947.16 - 1951.96] difficulty falling sleep always
[1949.36 - 1954.04] important not to eat too far from
[1951.96 - 1955.68] Bedtime either otherwise in the middle
[1954.04 - 1958.36] of the night your blood sugar will go
[1955.68 - 1961.64] down and then you'll need more stress
[1958.36 - 1964.24] hormone cortisol to get the glycogen out
[1961.64 - 1965.92] of the muscles to produce more glucose
[1964.24 - 1967.84] so it may wake you up in the middle of
[1965.92 - 1971.80] the night if you've eaten too far from
[1967.84 - 1973.48] Bedtime avoid fatty foods before bedtime
[1971.80 - 1976.52] because it's difficult to digest those
[1973.48 - 1978.40] you might have discomfort avoid fast
[1976.52 - 1980.20] carbs because it's it's going to cause
[1978.40 - 1982.40] that Sugar Spike that we mentioned and
[1980.20 - 1986.64] then a sugar crash in the middle of the
[1982.40 - 1989.36] night so good thing to do is eat two or
[1986.64 - 1993.12] three hours before your desired bedtime
[1989.36 - 1995.16] maybe some slow carbs kombucha maybe
[1993.12 - 1997.36] some protein good balance of slow carbs
[1995.16 - 2000.72] and protein and greens is usually the
[1997.36 - 2003.56] best course of action awesome so doctor
[2000.72 - 2006.48] you practice with the world-renowned
[2003.56 - 2009.16] psychiatrist Dr Daniel aan in the US and
[2006.48 - 2012.04] he's made this famous where he actually
[2009.16 - 2015.88] takes brain scans of people people who
[2012.04 - 2017.76] are caffeine addicts alcohol addicts um
[2015.88 - 2020.08] you know the the drugs of cocaine
[2017.76 - 2023.56] marijana and they show that the scans
[2020.08 - 2026.20] have holes in the brain now what are
[2023.56 - 2029.44] they what are the reasons the brain gets
[2026.20 - 2031.64] these holes um I mean I want the public
[2029.44 - 2033.08] to understand that you mean my
[2031.64 - 2036.40] terminology you're literally giving a
[2033.08 - 2040.40] tough part to the brain yeah so a slap
[2036.40 - 2042.08] so um when you see clients or patients
[2040.40 - 2043.64] like for example the question that just
[2042.08 - 2046.48] popped up as I'm talking to you with
[2043.64 - 2049.08] this question about holes in the brain
[2046.48 - 2051.04] insomnia is a massive problem for a lot
[2049.08 - 2052.60] of people they don't get good sleep
[2051.04 - 2054.28] could it be that they're slapping the
[2052.60 - 2055.44] brain and the brain's therefore refusing
[2054.28 - 2057.08] to shut
[2055.44 - 2060.64] down
[2057.08 - 2062.72] 100% so the spec images that we do at a
[2060.64 - 2065.88] in
[2062.72 - 2070.32] clinics so single
[2065.88 - 2072.48] Photon emission computed tomography a
[2070.32 - 2074.04] fancy way of saying we're looking at
[2072.48 - 2077.60] blood flow and
[2074.04 - 2081.04] activity so CTS MRIs look at a picture
[2077.60 - 2083.12] of the brain here we look at how much
[2081.04 - 2085.24] blood flow and activity is going on in
[2083.12 - 2087.36] different areas so I have to swallow
[2085.24 - 2091.08] some sort of dye or something or inject
[2087.36 - 2094.08] some dye to see it inject some dye and
[2091.08 - 2096.20] it's taken up by the brain cells and
[2094.08 - 2098.16] then the Imaging equipment the brain
[2096.20 - 2100.44] cells they take up the D
[2098.16 - 2104.28] they release light particles that are
[2100.44 - 2107.48] captured by the equipment and based on
[2104.28 - 2109.56] how much light is released it tells us
[2107.48 - 2113.20] how active those areas
[2109.56 - 2115.56] are and know we do it only in clinical
[2113.20 - 2119.20] conditions or even normal people do
[2115.56 - 2120.76] it everyone does it people who have
[2119.20 - 2123.64] clinical conditions they want to know if
[2120.76 - 2125.32] they have ADHD if they have depression
[2123.64 - 2128.28] anxiety what kind of depression what
[2125.32 - 2132.08] kind of anxiety brain injuries traumatic
[2128.28 - 2134.08] brain injuries contact Sports and then
[2132.08 - 2136.20] people who just want to see how healthy
[2134.08 - 2138.80] their brain is if they had risk for
[2136.20 - 2141.56] developing Dementia in a few years or
[2138.80 - 2142.72] not or they just want to just be on top
[2141.56 - 2144.28] of their game and make sure they're
[2142.72 - 2145.68] getting their brain health right so you
[2144.28 - 2148.16] can look at the brain and kind of
[2145.68 - 2151.96] predict that someone might get dementia
[2148.16 - 2155.24] yeah 20 20 years before 30 years before
[2151.96 - 2157.80] Oh So my grandmother had dementia so
[2155.24 - 2159.32] maybe in my 50s I want to do a break
[2157.80 - 2160.52] scan and see if there's a detrition
[2159.32 - 2165.12] that's what you're saying I could do
[2160.52 - 2168.24] that 100% come on is this is this is
[2165.12 - 2170.60] this available in India it is well there
[2168.24 - 2174.56] spec Imaging is available in India and
[2170.60 - 2176.52] you know you can scan various organs but
[2174.56 - 2179.68] unfortunately Aman clinics does not have
[2176.52 - 2181.80] a branch in India so we have tons of of
[2179.68 - 2185.24] folks coming through from India as well
[2181.80 - 2188.36] getting the brain scans and you know we
[2185.24 - 2190.08] can a lot of people want to do it they
[2188.36 - 2192.88] they have podcasts and they have their
[2190.08 - 2195.88] own TV shows and we do it for them as
[2192.88 - 2198.52] well so if any chance next time in us
[2195.88 - 2200.68] let me know beforehand I'll schedule to
[2198.52 - 2202.88] get a brain scan and we can even do one
[2200.68 - 2204.64] of these lives again we'll do live my
[2202.88 - 2207.28] brain is getting
[2204.64 - 2209.60] scan uh a few more questions before I
[2207.28 - 2213.16] let you get off to your deep sleep and
[2209.60 - 2214.80] your dream cycle exercise variables you
[2213.16 - 2216.92] know I remember I did a podcast with you
[2214.80 - 2219.56] and you told me that they're not very
[2216.92 - 2224.52] accurate on sleep tracking your sleep
[2219.56 - 2226.36] Rings the the variables um just dive in
[2224.52 - 2229.76] that what is the benefit if I use a
[2226.36 - 2231.48] sleep tracker and uh what is the benefit
[2229.76 - 2234.96] of not using a sleep tracker give us
[2231.48 - 2237.28] both sides of the point absolutely so
[2234.96 - 2241.12] one thing to remember is if you're using
[2237.28 - 2243.80] a sleep tracker don't obsess over it
[2241.12 - 2245.56] don't try and say oh my God it said I
[2243.80 - 2248.32] got this much dream sleep this much
[2245.56 - 2251.96] light sleep this much deep sleep so only
[2248.32 - 2253.76] so little deep sleep no those numbers
[2251.96 - 2256.68] don't matter in the greatest scheme of
[2253.76 - 2260.36] things because it's not accurate is a
[2256.68 - 2262.76] total measure of Total Sleep sure you
[2260.36 - 2264.96] can say Okay Chell I'm going to see how
[2262.76 - 2268.48] my sleep is trending over the course of
[2264.96 - 2272.64] the next week but as individual measures
[2268.48 - 2275.00] not a good idea total measure yes
[2272.64 - 2278.00] various variables you have the Apple
[2275.00 - 2281.04] watch you have Fitbit you have Aura ring
[2278.00 - 2283.20] a whoop all sorts of things right now
[2281.04 - 2285.92] the aura ring seems to be the most
[2283.20 - 2289.76] accurate one but not that accurate
[2285.92 - 2292.96] anyway so okay is a rough measure that's
[2289.76 - 2294.64] the the the long and short of it a lot
[2292.96 - 2296.96] of people don't have the wearables they
[2294.64 - 2299.64] don't want to spend tens of thousands of
[2296.96 - 2302.28] rupees on a Tracker no problem you don't
[2299.64 - 2304.24] really need one some folks just want to
[2302.28 - 2306.96] fill out a sleep diary to track their
[2304.24 - 2309.24] sleep so in the morning you wake up have
[2306.96 - 2312.28] it by a bedside write down what time you
[2309.24 - 2314.40] decided to go to sleep get into bed and
[2312.28 - 2316.92] then what time you think you fell asleep
[2314.40 - 2320.36] and what time you woke up in the morning
[2316.92 - 2321.44] and you know I always tell my folks well
[2320.36 - 2323.48] did you wake up in the middle of the
[2321.44 - 2325.40] night hi yeah I woke up at 2: in the
[2323.48 - 2326.76] morning then I woke up at 3: but I'm
[2325.40 - 2328.60] like you're not supposed to look at your
[2326.76 - 2331.20] watch how did you know exactly what time
[2328.60 - 2334.96] you were waking up because if you're
[2331.20 - 2336.60] looking at your watch you're worry right
[2334.96 - 2338.84] it's going to stress you out you won't
[2336.60 - 2341.28] be able to fall back back asleep so
[2338.84 - 2343.84] trying to sleep is the best way to wake
[2341.28 - 2345.68] your brain up and prevent yourself from
[2343.84 - 2348.28] falling back
[2345.68 - 2351.68] asleep I think I think that's very
[2348.28 - 2353.60] valuable advice um uh to use the tracker
[2351.68 - 2356.48] on an overall perspective I use the
[2353.60 - 2358.76] gabit ring in India and the overall
[2356.48 - 2360.72] perspective over here is that it kind of
[2358.76 - 2362.64] gives me the total volume of sleep but
[2360.72 - 2365.24] it also kind of tells me to go to sleep
[2362.64 - 2367.12] every day between 10: and 10:15 and the
[2365.24 - 2368.40] moment I start getting to 10:15 I'm like
[2367.12 - 2369.72] okay time to sleep time to sleep time to
[2368.40 - 2372.72] sleep but earlier when I didn't have the
[2369.72 - 2376.32] tracker I didn't like I can I I'll push
[2372.72 - 2377.84] it to 6:45 6 hours 45 7 hours there are
[2376.32 - 2381.12] quite a few more questions but I'm going
[2377.84 - 2383.04] to let you go shortly um one of the
[2381.12 - 2386.16] questions that came is and I think a lot
[2383.04 - 2389.64] of people do does music listening at
[2386.16 - 2391.48] bedtime increase Lou sleep and we so I'm
[2389.64 - 2394.80] adding my question to it now on top of
[2391.48 - 2396.88] this this came from Shirin and she's
[2394.80 - 2399.36] asked this question and then over on up
[2396.88 - 2400.84] my question that is which type of music
[2399.36 - 2402.92] should I listen to and which type of
[2400.84 - 2406.36] music I should not listen to before
[2402.92 - 2408.80] going to sleep okay this is a great
[2406.36 - 2411.96] question because there are certain sound
[2408.80 - 2415.56] waves and frequencies that are coming to
[2411.96 - 2417.08] the nervous system so binaural beats is
[2415.56 - 2420.60] very commonly
[2417.08 - 2423.92] used for this purpose binaural beats are
[2420.60 - 2426.24] unique sequence of sounds that have
[2423.92 - 2427.84] promote calming of the nervous system
[2426.24 - 2431.32] that's fine
[2427.84 - 2435.52] some folks like classical music some
[2431.32 - 2438.36] folks like Gregorian chanting to calm
[2435.52 - 2441.88] the nervous system down it really
[2438.36 - 2444.28] depends on what music works best for you
[2441.88 - 2448.04] ideally you don't want to listen to you
[2444.28 - 2449.72] know heavy metal or EDM or something
[2448.04 - 2451.20] like that that's going to pump you up
[2449.72 - 2454.28] that's going to make you
[2451.20 - 2457.64] excited if you want something soothing
[2454.28 - 2459.32] it's going to vary now some now so songs
[2457.64 - 2461.72] and music are the soundtrack of our
[2459.32 - 2463.64] lives so if you have a song that's going
[2461.72 - 2465.72] to remind you of some horrible
[2463.64 - 2468.04] relationship breakup or something like
[2465.72 - 2470.64] that avoid that you don't want to cry
[2468.04 - 2472.56] and go to sleep in a negative mindset
[2470.64 - 2474.96] because that might trigger nightmares
[2472.56 - 2477.00] right as we spoke about there that's
[2474.96 - 2479.96] that's each to their own each to their
[2477.00 - 2483.16] own um I recently started playing
[2479.96 - 2484.56] something known as a hang drum and um I
[2483.16 - 2486.12] bought one and I was playing it and I
[2484.56 - 2489.32] found it very therapeutic and then I
[2486.12 - 2491.32] turned it upside down I saw that 432
[2489.32 - 2495.52] Hertz was written on
[2491.32 - 2497.96] it that is that is the the frequency of
[2495.52 - 2501.96] of heaven right that is where all the
[2497.96 - 2501.96] bells were back in
[2502.48 - 2508.80] the' Lost Dr
[2505.60 - 2510.80] Shane yeah yeah you're back you're back
[2508.80 - 2512.32] you were talking you broke off at that
[2510.80 - 2516.12] was where the bells were made in the
[2512.32 - 2518.28] past and you the bells were supposed to
[2516.12 - 2521.00] resonate at 4:30 22 Herz that's the
[2518.28 - 2522.68] golden frequency that's the range that's
[2521.00 - 2525.48] healing range that's the therapeutic
[2522.68 - 2527.00] calming range I've started I've started
[2525.48 - 2530.72] deep breathing and we started playing
[2527.00 - 2532.60] 432 Hertz and I just find that I
[2530.72 - 2534.72] recently and this is not scientific but
[2532.60 - 2536.72] this is my personal experience I did a
[2534.72 - 2539.52] heavyweight training workout on legs and
[2536.72 - 2541.68] I hate legs like most people and so
[2539.52 - 2545.28] after finishing about seven sets of leg
[2541.68 - 2547.64] press uh which was twice my body weight
[2545.28 - 2549.12] um I couldn't walk after that my trainer
[2547.64 - 2551.72] is like you're going to cry tomorrow
[2549.12 - 2554.80] with domes and so I went back and we did
[2551.72 - 2557.36] this deep breathing session with 432 htz
[2554.80 - 2559.60] music uh pulsating electromagnetic
[2557.36 - 2562.68] frequency sleeping through the night and
[2559.60 - 2565.40] a lot of pineapple and glutamine and
[2562.68 - 2568.12] trust me next next 48 hours I was
[2565.40 - 2570.24] searching for soness so why am I sharing
[2568.12 - 2572.56] this with you is Shane I think a
[2570.24 - 2575.20] combination of diet and nutrition are

[2630.48 - 2635.12] your brain and your sleep it's very true
[2633.20 - 2638.08] I think Shane you're much younger than
[2635.12 - 2639.76] me and if I could get back to your age
[2638.08 - 2643.12] the one thing that I would tell myself
[2639.76 - 2645.56] is our profession has an occupation
[2643.12 - 2649.20] Hazard and a very good occupation has it
[2645.56 - 2652.04] is people judge us right uh from the way
[2649.20 - 2655.08] we sleep the way we eat the way we think
[2652.04 - 2658.00] uh and everything else so um it's
[2655.08 - 2660.80] awesome uh we we'll Jam again soon uh
[2658.00 - 2663.92] I'll let you go and get your uh sweet
[2660.80 - 2666.28] dream sleeps deep sleep by the way would
[2663.92 - 2668.68] you be watching any blue light after
[2666.28 - 2672.04] this is your orange filter on right now
[2668.68 - 2674.16] on your phone the filter is
[2672.04 - 2675.92] on before I let you go you got so much
[2674.16 - 2677.84] of valuable information is this true
[2675.92 - 2679.64] about the blue light affecting us and
[2677.84 - 2683.00] and and triggering us before going to
[2679.64 - 2685.08] sleep yes so and I can spend as much
[2683.00 - 2687.08] time as you need ran I I love doing
[2685.08 - 2689.76] these with you it's an absolute honor to
[2687.08 - 2692.68] to be with you as always so when we
[2689.76 - 2694.96] think about blue light any light affects
[2692.68 - 2697.60] or suppresses our melatonin which makes
[2694.96 - 2700.76] it harder for you to fall asleep we're
[2697.60 - 2702.32] most sensitive to blue light but red
[2700.76 - 2704.48] light doesn't affect us isn't that
[2702.32 - 2707.00] beautiful the way we are created because
[2704.48 - 2709.08] red light Sunset you know it's not going
[2707.00 - 2711.16] to affect our melatonin anyway melatonin
[2709.08 - 2712.76] can rise normally so we're more
[2711.16 - 2715.00] sensitive to Blue Light so blue light
[2712.76 - 2717.16] filters can help to some degree blue
[2715.00 - 2719.76] light blocking glasses can help to some
[2717.16 - 2722.00] degree but not completely that's why I
[2719.76 - 2724.00] always advise folks you know dim the
[2722.00 - 2725.52] lights an hour before bedtime even at
[2724.00 - 2727.12] home don't have bright fluorescent
[2725.52 - 2730.64] lights till late at night even if you're
[2727.12 - 2732.72] on the screen dim the lights calming
[2730.64 - 2735.44] environment there's a good reason people
[2732.72 - 2737.40] had candles back in the old days you
[2735.44 - 2739.84] know and then when you're waking up get
[2737.40 - 2741.68] some sunlight on your face feel sorry
[2739.84 - 2744.44] but I have my light on at home no that's
[2741.68 - 2747.48] maybe you know 5,000 Lux but the
[2744.44 - 2750.12] sunlight is 100,000 luxs that's what we
[2747.48 - 2751.64] need to regulate and lock in your
[2750.12 - 2755.12] circadian
[2751.64 - 2757.16] rhythm awesome Dr Shane it's a pleasure
[2755.12 - 2759.88] when you're next when you're next in
[2757.16 - 2761.80] here to let me know we'll do a live at
[2759.88 - 2763.32] the city that you're in and we'll do it

[2771.32 - 2775.96] thank you so much so that was Dr Shane
[2773.84 - 2778.92] who's written the book Peak sleep
[2775.96 - 2781.92] performance for athletes and Dr Shane
[2778.92 - 2784.92] practices in Chicago uh at the D Dr
[2781.92 - 2787.68] Daniel aan clinics he's a world-renowned
[2784.92 - 2790.44] psychologist but this book um has
[2787.68 - 2793.72] changed my counseling because you know I
[2790.44 - 2796.20] always tell athletes that um you know
[2793.72 - 2799.00] I'm going to give you an amazing diet
[2796.20 - 2802.28] but if your sleep is lousy then your
[2799.00 - 2805.52] brain no matter how perfect your diet is
[2802.28 - 2808.68] is at some point going to slap you uh so
[2805.52 - 2810.76] it's a combination of you can't outrun a
[2808.68 - 2812.24] bad diet which is the exercise part so
[2810.76 - 2814.04] people think they can eat whatever they
[2812.24 - 2818.80] want and then exercise it so you can't
[2814.04 - 2821.76] outrun a bad diet and you can't um
[2818.80 - 2823.96] undersleep a very fantastic diet so
[2821.76 - 2826.56] you've got to get your sleep and as I
[2823.96 - 2828.88] say always your body is the most
