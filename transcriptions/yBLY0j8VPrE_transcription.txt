Transcript: diabetes sugar you may have heard about it well me and my dad were having a conversation recently he's 77 and he's like you know what my diabetes is under control I'm like Dad your diabetes is not under control you're taking 14 or 15 tablets and you're not walking and not looking at your diet India is the diabetic capital of the world 77 million in 2019 we slated to go up to 134 Million by 20145 as per data in the internet now what shocked me was was 57% of these individuals remain undiagnosed which means diabetics is a silent killer now I want you to understand that when my father made this statement my diabetes is under control he is using medication to control his diabetes his diabetes is not under control medicine is trying to control it but what if I could tell you that there is a way for diabetes to be effectively managed in fact for you to not get diabetes you have to learn to effectively manage your energy levels which comes from your input which is diet and your output which is your exercise both of which we are culprits in this country of not doing it correctly like our grandparents did they ate correctly they walked and exercised correctly something that you and I are not being exposed to so here's my video on diabeties and how we can effectively get us to understand what could I do to pre prevent diabetes or if I do have diabetes what are the small things that I can do to arrest the progression of this disease so yesterday in my counseling room I was explaining to a 30-year-old kid how diabetes forms in the human body now you first need to understand sugar and its management you see when you eat food the food is broken down now this food contains carbohydrates which is the sugar this sugar breaks down and this sugar breaks down into fructose or glucose now this goes into the bloodstream and now when it goes into the bloodstream the bloodstream says oh wow Salam sa all sugars come you have to go into all the cells you have to go to the brain you have to give energy and everything but you cannot have a high sugar level so there is a police cop for this high sugar level now who's this police cop this police cop is a guy called insulin insulin is a hormone it's like you know if there's too much crowd on the roads outside your house then you call up the police station pancreas hello Mr pancreas can you send one hoala vehicle one police vehicle the police vehicle will come with cops the insulin guy comes out and tells all the sugar Mo molecules don't party in the street what is partying in the street high blood sugar level so by doing ly insulin pushes all the sugar into the cell now over years of having lot of parties in the streets high blood sugar level insulin gets a call at the police station hello outside Mr Ryan Fernando's house there's a party happening are are every day and every year high sugar level high parties happening yeah we are going to send eight police police vehicles we send eight police vehicles AR by the sugar party doesn't disappear then next month we sell 10 police vehicles this is the concept of type 2 diabetes where over a period of time your police insulin Guy cannot respond well or its insulin resistance has increased now you have another type of Diabetes which is type 1 diabetes which is more on an autoimmune side where your police station gets affected when your police station gets affected that's the pancreas the production of insulin is lowered or lesser and therefore you have to recruit a private security Force the private security force is injections of insulin so now you've understood you take carbohydrate that forms into sugar and then you need police to control it now every day if you're having a party in your bloodstream by eating the wrong foods every day you have to send boat loads or truck loads of police to control that after sometime police will be say contr sug so this is diabetes for you and it starts with your inactivity because when you do a lot of activity you pull out all the party makers in your blood you lower your blood sugar level by walking after every meal and you also lower your blood sugar level by eating the right Foods when you construct your protein carbs and fats in a right quantity at the right time of the right quality so let me explain further to you and then there is another form of diabetes which happens mostly to mothers it's called gestational diabetes Now this diabetes develops during pregnancy when the body cannot produce enough of the insulin to meet the increased needs of both the mother and the growing baby this condition normally happens in the second or the third trimester and generally solves itself after child birth however you need to know this mothers gestational diabetes can significantly increase the risk of Mother's later de veloping type 2 diabetes later on in her life and it does pose a health risk to both the baby and the mother and there's a likelihood of more obesity and type 2 diabetes both in the mother and child gestational diabetes affects pregnant women who have a higher risk factor such as being overweight there's already a family history of diabetes or they belong to certain ethnic groups so managing gestational diabetes involves again making dietary adjustments to control the blood sugar level such as eating balanced meals most mothers are told eat double the quantity that's not true you just need a carefully controlled diet with the medical nutritionist so monitoring carbohydrate would be important in pregnancy and kind of making the food consumption spread out throughout the day to avoid High spikes and blood glucose levels in some cases the mothers may need insulin therapy to maintain optimal blood sugar levels now my solution is regular physical activity and monitoring of the blood glucose levels which will help better manage or prevent gestational diabetes I would recommend a close collaboration with healthc care providers including dietitians endocrinologists that ensure both the mother and the baby remain healthy so you know what I always tell people is I asked them a list of questions to diagnose diabetes with just verbal questions and those questions are in including do you have frequency of urination do you have excessive thirst do you feel extremely hungry suddenly you have gained weight or suddenly youve lost weight lots of fatigue irritability I've seen people who get irritated very easily can have uh diabetes blood Vision uh you get cuts and sores in the older age and they don't heal lots of frequent cough colds infections this could be because of a higher sugar another one which is not mentioned I would like to say that when you pee in a toilet and you find Ants the next day in around that bowl then you have sugar in your urine that's another way to check whether you got diabetes and so now that you got these questions ask yourself these questions let's talk about what could be the causes the causes could be definitely weight I look at fat people and I'm like dude you're a walking ticking Time Bomb for diabetes overweight and obesity number one physical inactivity insulin resistance genetic predecision Mommy Daddy had it poor diet is like everybody right now in the corporate world with high processed sugars and un healthy fats eating out if I look at your e-commerce apps for ordering food I can tell you with the risk element how quickly you're going to get diabetic so do you think you have diabetes do you think you're a candidate that you could become diabetic because of the way you eat so now I have a solution and that's called Nutrition Therapy Nutrition Therapy is a crucial component of diabetic management now like my dad said you know my diabetes under control he has no Nutrition Therapy now what I want to do is I need you to understand it involves a personalized diet plan designed not only to manage your glucose levels but also your body weight and balance if you have high cholesterol and BP and other issues reduce those risk factors using your diet thus you eliminate any issues that are coming from the cardiovascular point of view also so some of the key strategies that I use with my clients which have not been successful with my dad's carbohydrate management dad eat less bread I want him to monitor his carbohydrate intake I want him to choose high fiber low glycemic index foods which include whole rins legumes dlls non-starchy vegetables and fruits Yes you heard me correctly diabetics can eat fruits but you know to you need to know which fruit is allowed for a diabetic based on its glycemic index another strategy is to include proper balanced meals I believe the human race does not understand the concept of balanced meals it involves incorporating a variety of foods in balanced proportions to manage blood sugar levels and this includes lean protein healthy fats high fiber carbohydrates in actual ratio of 5 is to 3 is to2 that's 50% carbohydrates 30% protein and 20% fat now the problem over here is very few people understand diet planning and I have been able to get phenomenal results with A continuous glucose monitoring device because you make an error and you can see a sugar Spike so eat the wrong food you see a sugar Spike so I think balanced diet when I verbally tell it to people hey you need to follow balance diet people nod their head and say yes yes we know what is balanced diet they know what is balanced diet but they don't know how to serve them cells a balanced diet and by putting a CGM device on you begin to correct a person saying that dude look at this you got a sugar Spike so then you're like oh what did I eat half an hour earlier oh I ate this much amount of rice maybe tomorrow I'll eat a little bit lesser rice so that comes to my next Point eating lesser portion control in diabetic management we need to be mindful of por sizes to avoid overeating and weight gain I just had a sports athlete in my clinic and her fat percentage has gone up by about 900 G she said but I ate so disciplined and I said you know what this was the season of mango and she went oh yeah I really ate a lot of mangoes look potion control is one part the other part is we forget what we ate yesterday I can't remember what I ate for breakfast yesterday do you so when we don't remember our meals when we don't have a food diary when we don't have a CGM we are eating to fulfill our belly needs not our biochemistry requirement so if you were a finely tuned vehicle and you had to put fuel into your body I would say the amount of carbohydrate you put into your body is such that you never run out of fuel but you never put so much of fuel into you that your petrol tanks which is your fat Mass keeps increasing now how can we do this I have a solution one is the CGM but the other is regular meals and snacks we do something known as the isocaloric approach where we eat at regular intervals to maintain consistent blood sugar levels so that's one strategy I have another strategy called the omad one meal a day now this can only be done with Medical Nutrition Therapy that is you go to a medical dietician and she monitors your CGM as well as what she would be doing is testing out your heart levels as well as checking your weight and body fat percentage 3 to 6 month period to see if either many meals or one meal a day is what's going to work for you and in that Constructor meal the protein carve fat ratio also is carefully monitored and in that the timing of nutrition is also monitored and in that the sequence by which you eat in a meal that is first first I eat my salad then I have my soup and then I have my protein and then last I have my carbohydrate and this leads to the lowest possible sugar spike in your blood levels so here are some quick tips to help you manage your diabetes
