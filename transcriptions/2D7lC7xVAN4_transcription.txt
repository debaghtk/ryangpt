[0.56 - 4.16] hi my name is ryan ferrano and i'm the
[2.40 - 6.40] chief nutritionist at kwan nutrition
[4.16 - 9.44] clinics we're a team of dietitians at
[6.40 - 10.72] practice online and at our clinics
[9.44 - 13.20] across the world
[10.72 - 15.28] now my job as a chief nutritionist is to
[13.20 - 17.36] change the way people eat
[15.28 - 19.20] my parents have taught me how to eat i
[17.36 - 22.00] love my parents i miss them a lot i
[19.20 - 24.48] haven't seen them in the last two years
[22.00 - 26.96] mr vishnupay here on my screen
[24.48 - 28.80] is my father's age 72 year old mr
[26.96 - 31.28] vishnupay came to me last year in
[28.80 - 34.48] october which was nine months ago
[31.28 - 38.40] with diabetes on insulin
[34.48 - 40.32] toe had to be cut and amputated because
[38.40 - 42.56] of the high sugar level so if you've
[40.32 - 44.56] been there as a kid taking care of your
[42.56 - 45.68] parents and i'm afraid for my parents
[44.56 - 47.68] because they've given me the best in
[45.68 - 48.56] life and i want to give the best back to
[47.68 - 50.16] them
[48.56 - 52.64] and i believe that
[50.16 - 53.44] nutrition can really really change the
[52.64 - 55.04] way
[53.44 - 56.88] a person's health
[55.04 - 59.76] can be you know
[56.88 - 61.28] made better so mr bishop came with me
[59.76 - 62.40] with all of these problems and i just
[61.28 - 64.88] want to show
[62.40 - 66.88] to you his success and this could be
[64.88 - 69.04] your parent this could be your parent
[66.88 - 71.92] with diabetes hypertension heart disease
[69.04 - 74.00] cholesterol even cancer we have a cancer
[71.92 - 76.24] division and quantitation
[74.00 - 77.60] and i want to show you he came in in
[76.24 - 80.48] october
[77.60 - 81.44] his weight was 100 kgs
[80.48 - 83.68] okay
[81.44 - 86.16] you can see the graph here as he's
[83.68 - 88.32] worked on a monthly nutrition plan with
[86.16 - 93.76] me and his dropped weight today he's
[88.32 - 97.92] come down to 78 kgs that's a whopping 28
[93.76 - 99.28] kgs down i am wearing my old t-shirt and
[97.92 - 101.52] floating in it
[99.28 - 103.44] now two of me can
[101.52 - 109.04] fit into it and look at his fan
[103.44 - 111.44] percentage from 33 percent down to 25
[109.04 - 114.08] if you look at his fart mass in his kgs
[111.44 - 117.20] that means mr vishnupay at 72 when he
[114.08 - 119.04] came to me had 30 kgs of fat in his body
[117.20 - 120.80] and the fat is causing the insulin
[119.04 - 124.00] resistance which is causing you to have
[120.80 - 126.80] diabetes with weight training and
[124.00 - 128.60] every month proper guided nutrition plan
[126.80 - 132.24] is down to
[128.60 - 132.24] 19.78 kgs
[134.08 - 138.32] but what i want to communicate to you
[135.84 - 141.12] better is the muscle mass
[138.32 - 143.04] he hasn't lost muscle mass
[141.12 - 144.88] he is remain stagnant look at this
[143.04 - 146.32] straight line
[144.88 - 148.56] look at the straight line and then look
[146.32 - 151.44] at his visceral fat visceral fat is the
[148.56 - 152.16] fat around the organs
[151.44 - 154.24] now
[152.16 - 156.32] zero is really really good
[154.24 - 158.48] uh most people have around 30 visceral
[156.32 - 160.64] fats or big pot bellies diabetes
[158.48 - 162.80] cholesterol death cancer all of that
[160.64 - 165.52] related to the visceral fat i just
[162.80 - 169.44] convinced him to improve walking
[165.52 - 171.76] and 18.5 down to 12 visceral fat we're
[169.44 - 174.00] still on the battle to go even lower
[171.76 - 176.48] but look at his body age
[174.00 - 179.04] body age is metabolic age when he
[176.48 - 180.64] started with me his birth certificate
[179.04 - 182.72] age
[180.64 - 184.96] nine january 2021
[182.72 - 187.36] and his metabolic age was the same but
[184.96 - 190.40] as he's gone on a plan with me he has
[187.36 - 193.92] come down in metabolic age so today mr
[190.40 - 198.08] vishnupai is 61 years old
[193.92 - 200.48] he in nine months has become 11 years
[198.08 - 202.16] younger i am wearing my son's clothes
[200.48 - 203.76] and looking smart
[202.16 - 205.92] the other thing i want to show you is
[203.76 - 208.96] his blood parameters
[205.92 - 212.32] in 2015 we have data here 12.5
[208.96 - 216.24] glycerated hemoglobin in 2009 it was
[212.32 - 219.44] 2019 still 11.6 when he joined me in
[216.24 - 221.92] october was 11.5 this is his blood test
[219.44 - 224.24] and today i can proudly tell you he's no
[221.92 - 226.40] longer a diabetic he's no longer an
[224.24 - 228.40] insulin he's no longer on medication
[226.40 - 230.08] because we have changed the way he eats
[228.40 - 233.84] and we've changed and guided the way
[230.08 - 236.96] he's done his fat burning wire exercise
[233.84 - 240.40] this is amazing look at a fasting
[236.96 - 244.32] average sugar level three one two and
[240.40 - 248.00] when he started off with me it was 283
[244.32 - 250.56] 283 and today he's down to 114 fasting
[248.00 - 252.24] sugar level and and this is so so
[250.56 - 254.88] amazing if you look at all his
[252.24 - 256.48] parameters improving we we target all of
[254.88 - 260.00] this over a period of time look at his
[256.48 - 262.80] glucose 185 down to 103 and right now i
[260.00 - 264.80] don't have the data but he's down at 80.
[262.80 - 266.00] the the best part about this gentleman
[264.80 - 267.04] is
[266.00 - 268.88] he's
[267.04 - 270.48] he's so fit today
[268.88 - 273.60] that uh you know i wanted to share a
[270.48 - 277.44] small video with you uh i want to share
[273.60 - 277.44] a small video with you which is
[278.64 - 282.96] that's him
[280.40 - 285.36] his old jeans his old jeans and he's
[282.96 - 288.24] floating in it so
[285.36 - 290.64] my perspective to you as a kid who loves
[288.24 - 291.52] his or her parent
[290.64 - 293.36] is
[291.52 - 295.12] our parents took care of us and they
[293.36 - 297.68] told us what to eat and how to eat it
[295.12 - 299.36] don't eat snacks and don't eat chocolate
[297.68 - 300.64] i have the same phone call to my parents
[299.36 - 303.60] these days
[300.64 - 306.40] and i wish and hope that you're like aj
[303.60 - 308.24] and sanjay his two kids who said mr
[306.40 - 310.48] fernando nothing doing our father has
[308.24 - 312.64] given us everything in the world we want
[310.48 - 314.48] him to come on a nutrition plan with you
[312.64 - 316.00] at coordination
[314.48 - 318.48] and
[316.00 - 320.24] he was very reluctant initially it's
[318.48 - 321.76] like oh it's a medicine
[320.24 - 323.76] you're going to stop me from you i'm
[321.76 - 325.76] going to play a video of him
[323.76 - 328.56] in his green tea i just i just fell off
[325.76 - 328.56] the chair laughing
[331.76 - 337.68] having my green tea
[335.12 - 340.08] his green tea video is delirious
[337.68 - 342.80] he hates green tea but did you know that
[340.08 - 345.36] green tea helps improve insulin
[342.80 - 347.92] resistance i give him negativity which
[345.36 - 350.88] improves insulin sensitivity so there
[347.92 - 354.00] are a lot of molecules in nature
[350.88 - 357.68] that can help you lose weight
[354.00 - 358.88] age gracefully become younger and above
[357.68 - 361.76] all
[358.88 - 364.48] throw out the medicine basket that
[361.76 - 366.56] modern day medicine is giving you
[364.48 - 369.20] and it's not the medicine that's wrong
[366.56 - 372.32] it's your way that you eat is wrong so
[369.20 - 374.24] kua teaches you how to eat correctly
[372.32 - 375.76] anybody watching this video
