Transcript: this billionaire spends 2 million a year just to reverse his age to 18 years Yes you heard that right Brian Johnson the founder of blueprint spends his money to reverse his age till now many people think that you can only age and get older and not any younger well there are two types of age one is your normal age you may be 20 or 30 years it's the number of years that you are on this planet and then there is your biological age the age of your body you can be 20 years old but your biological age can be more 30 or even 40 your biological age and your normal age is not the same however your biological age is reversible I have successfully reversed the biological age of my billionaire clients by over 10 years yes it's possible Ryan in this case eats a strict diet of 2,250 calories per day in a 6h hour p period which she combines with a 1hour exercise regime 111 supplements daily a rigid bedtime routine blood transfusions and daily Health test among other things in the hopes of achieving the equivalent of an 18-year-old physique now let's understand the science behind this first we have telr and cellular aging the size of the telome determines the Aging rate the shorter the tel the more older your body is the second one is your EP genetic modifications epigenetic changes the alterations in gene Expressions without changing the underlining DNA sequence playing a role in aging here at the Quan nutrition clinics we do genetic testings which shows if our clients are more prone to these changes few of the tips that you can do to follow a healthy diet an organic plant-based diet rich in fruits vegetables and whole grains May positively influence epigenetic modifications having nonv only if you can source organic non veg products is a good idea most of the products in the market today are genetically modified or injected with chemicals and hormones to give you bigger e this may not be good for your age some studies now are also suggesting can you go into intermittent fasting which can impact gene expression related to longevity intermittent fasting lets the body Channel its energy towards healing and repairing all the damaged parts of its body there's another person in the age Revolution David Sinclair my mentor Harvard Professor australian-american biologist and academic known for his research on aging and epigenetics these longevity genes we work on are turned on by fasting one of the key ways in which intermittent fasting May promote good health is by activating a process known as Auto Fiji Auto Fiji is a body's mechanism for recycling old or damaged cells and has been linked with many health benefits including increased lifespan and protection against diseases like cancer now what are Dr David Sinclair's eating patterns a plantbased diet he skips breakfast Stakes a small amount of olive oil or yogurt with his supplements drinks a lot of water consumes very low sugar and starchy Foods prioritize your nutrition is what these billionaire and doctors are talking about you are what you eat your body is the most expensive real estate you can ever own how would you take care of it by eating the right food in today's world everything is available at the touch of a button it is important to know what is right for the body and therefore my years of practice tell me that the best results are obtained when we follow a tailor made customized diet that fits into our lifestyle our genetics and we understand what is right and what is wrong for our body consider incorporating foods with proven anti-aging properties my favorites blueberries geric which contains cumin really powerful broccoli sulfine it's anti-cancer anti-aging Tomatoes lopine boost lung function amazing for the skin my alltime favorite butterhead lettuce high levels of nitric oxide even more than that of beetroot pomegranates contains beta sterol which is a block cleaner keeps your arteries clean coldpressed coconut oil amazing for the gut system mustard oil for cooking olive oil extra virgin for salad probiotics and green tea now all of this I can give it to you if you come to the contion clinics where I practice and we will help you reverse your biological age like I've done with many people including my own self now another thing is I'd like you to also do exercise a mix of cardiovascular strength training and flexibility exercises because as we age we lose muscle therefore if we do exercise we can rebuild our muscle and maintain it so that we can overcome this age related muscle loss another thing to do sleep sleep is the new diet sleep is the new anti-aging pill ensure you get consistently 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep each night not 6 7 to 9 sleep is important as many important detox and repair processes happen whilst we sleep a good sleep a deep sleep coupled with fasting is the Perfect combo for a great detox and repair session for your body a good night sleep will also ensure a good mood and a better productivity the next day developing a relaxing bedtime routine before you get to bed to enhance your sleep quality is the name of the game sleep at the same time every day foods that help you sleep better are a 55% carbohydrate based meal 2 to 3 hours before sleeping ensure that this food includes complex carbohydrates good fats melatonin rich foods half a bowl of chickpeas four walnuts 2 to three tar cherries or maybe even 10 pistachios an hour before bedtime are potent melatonin sleep natural pills other foods that help sleep better chamomile tea my favorite healthy milk and the other things that you can do is smell lavender lavender is known to be calming keep your room dark keep your phone away far away not next to you and stop all blue lights from technology 2 hours before bet and consider now supplements I advise supplements only if they're necessary as these vitamins and minerals can be obtained from the food and the surroundings your job is to consult a nutritionist or your doctor before incorporating supplements into your lifestyle they are beneficial but remember supplements are a nutritional convenience for your nutritional indiscipline so first get nutritionally disciplined then turn to supplements by the way one of my favorites is omega-3 fatty acids to maintain the cell membrane integrity and brain function 60% of the brain is fat and of that 50% is omega-3 in fact in my clinic I do an omega-3 pin prick blood test reach out to to me to get that blood test done it's a crystal ball gazing into your future in the age Revolution vitamin D will become the four most runner in anti-aging let's face it all of us are deficient in vitamin D all the thousands of blood tests have done at the Quan Clinic come back testing with low vitamin D level so please do test yourself the link is in my bio to get a blood test take a supplement under nutritional advice or doctor's supervision and vitamin D is crucial in testosterone function and burning of fat in your body another another great nutritional supplement that I love is collagen after you've crossed a certain age your body produces lesser collagen and therefore your skin starts to Sag and become wrinkled so maybe supplementation with collagen is an amazing anti-aging Feelgood Factor now another medical breakthrough product being prescribed by doctors in the west is rapamycin I don't advise you to take this without medical advice but it's considered one of the most powerful drugs in longevity and it's been researched extensively in terms of extending life lify so if you have any interest research up Romy and talk to your nutritionist or your medical doctor now Beyond supplements Beyond diet Beyond food Beyond exercise is its important for Stress Management include techniques such as meditation deep breathing or yoga because when you lower your stress levels your body ages slower consider mindful practices to reduce the impact of chronic stresses stress is a silent killer many diseases or originate in the human body when it is stressed this is because of the high cortisol level which is a stress hormone and many imbalances are created in fact Pot Bellies are a result of high cortisol levels so you're stressed out and the pot belly is making you older now if stress is chronic this imbalance rakes havoc in our system we do not want distress anywhere next to us and therefore it's important to understand what would distress Us in stressful situations be aware in okav Japan they have something called the Blue Zone where they have Community Building programs we humans are social creatures we cannot live in isolation and it takes a bad tot on the body in this age of social media everyone is well connected but people are more isolated than ever ironic isn't it you can have many close friends online but the friends that you have offline to physically interact with you are the difference markers maintaining strong social connections like they do in Japan where they live to 100 years plus call the Blue zone is a secret to a longer life and a healthier life engage in activities interact with family members and friends that will bring joy and fulfillment to you every day life is beyond only a mobile phone a video or social media get friendly get talking build relationships with people and that's how you and I are going to live beyond a 100 if you want me to work with you and reduce your biological age like I've done with thousands of people myself self included I've dropped my body age from 49 to a whopping 35 years of age we can do this together how reach out to me in the link below or in the descriptor you can find me available online as Ryan Fernando or reach out to me at the qua nutrition clinics where I practice together with a plan in place with the diagnostic testings and with the correct strategies we can make you stronger fitter younger and suddenly increase your real estate value to become 4X 5x or in this case much younger
