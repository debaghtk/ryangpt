[0.28 - 4.84] nobody will die from intermittent
[2.24 - 6.16] fasting the human race is eating too
[4.84 - 8.72] much and if you're doing the
[6.16 - 8.72] intermittent
[8.97 - 13.68] [Music]
[11.24 - 16.08] fasting a recent study revealed that
[13.68 - 18.92] people who followed intermittent fasting
[16.08 - 21.44] were 91% more likely to have died from
[18.92 - 23.84] cardiovascular disease than those who
[21.44 - 28.92] did not practice intermittent
[23.84 - 30.52] fasting news flash this is why I feel a
[28.92 - 33.28] study like this promotes Ed in the
[30.52 - 36.20] Indian media is wrong for our 1.3
[33.28 - 39.12] billion population do not listen to this
[36.20 - 41.00] advice here's my take you see the
[39.12 - 42.64] intermittent fasting I got my team to
[41.00 - 45.40] pull out the study I first thought it
[42.64 - 48.12] was a peer-reviewed study but I came to
[45.40 - 51.00] know it's a poster paper submitted now
[48.12 - 53.16] this was done on 20,000 people it was
[51.00 - 55.20] the Caucasian or the white race and some
[53.16 - 58.60] black people this is by this is not
[55.20 - 60.88] Indian audience first point okay second
[58.60 - 63.08] point is the people that died were from
[60.88 - 66.60] cardiovascular and cancer which means
[63.08 - 69.52] they already had it here's my take India
[66.60 - 72.00] number one when do you do intermittent
[69.52 - 74.56] fasting you do intermittent fasting when
[72.00 - 78.16] your doctor has told you by up
[74.56 - 79.92] overweight you are more than 24.6 BMI so
[78.16 - 81.72] what do you do you have to cut down on
[79.92 - 84.52] your eating when you cut down on your
[81.72 - 87.08] eating there are two strategies one is
[84.52 - 90.16] reduce the portion or reduce the eating
[87.08 - 92.68] window in this study they finding of
[90.16 - 96.24] that people who ate in an 8h hour window
[92.68 - 98.28] but you start eating at say 12:00 in the
[96.24 - 100.40] afternoon and finish eating by 8:00 in
[98.28 - 102.40] the evening that's an 8 Hour window such
[100.40 - 104.40] people had a 91% more risk of
[102.40 - 106.84] cardiovascular disease now this is my
[104.40 - 109.12] take one when you do intermittent
[106.84 - 111.20] fasting you are constructing the diet on
[109.12 - 113.76] your own you are not going to your
[111.20 - 115.96] medical doctor and doing the blood test
[113.76 - 117.88] which blood test you have to do the
[115.96 - 120.16] cholesterol the lipoprotein A
[117.88 - 122.36] lipoprotein B homosysteine
[120.16 - 124.68] C reactive protein and the size of your
[122.36 - 126.92] cholesterol particles in addition to
[124.68 - 128.76] this your good doctor your metabolic
[126.92 - 130.92] doctor your cardiovascular doctor your
[128.76 - 135.04] endocrinologist will also ask you to do
[130.92 - 137.68] an heart checkup which is the ECG the 2D
[135.04 - 139.92] Doppler and the calcium CT score now
[137.68 - 142.28] once you do this then they will clear
[139.92 - 144.40] you for exercise and diet but then you
[142.28 - 146.28] try and do the diet on your own it's not
[144.40 - 148.84] a medical nutritionist helping you so
[146.28 - 151.56] your protein carbs and fats and more
[148.84 - 154.04] specifically the antioxidants which
[151.56 - 156.60] protect you against damage cellular
[154.04 - 159.00] damage inside your body also I've seen
[156.60 - 161.68] when people do intermittent fasting they
[159.00 - 164.04] forget to drink water did you know that
[161.68 - 167.60] there was a study done on alkaline water
[164.04 - 170.32] which says it reduced the viscosity and
[167.60 - 171.76] platelet aggregation by 2% when you're
[170.32 - 173.76] doing intermittent fasting a lot of
[171.76 - 175.88] people forget to drink water hydrate
[173.76 - 177.60] well so your blood becomes more jarada
[175.88 - 179.56] more thicker so chances of a
[177.60 - 181.68] cardiovascular incidence are higher and
[179.56 - 184.04] again I go back to my previous Point
[181.68 - 186.48] people who are heavier in weight have
[184.04 - 188.96] diabetes problem have hypertension
[186.48 - 190.32] problem or are on the cusp of getting
[188.96 - 191.60] these problems so doctor tells you to
[190.32 - 194.20] lose weight because he's looked at your
[191.60 - 196.12] blood test because you have BP marker or
[194.20 - 198.44] cholesterol marker or sugar marker so
[196.12 - 201.00] it's kind of you're in a cycle and food
[198.44 - 203.08] for thought if you not done this with a
[201.00 - 204.60] nutritionist if you not done it with a
[203.08 - 205.92] certified te I see a lot of people
[204.60 - 208.52] yesterday there were two gentlemen in
[205.92 - 210.32] the gym they were working out like crazy
[208.52 - 212.08] they are doing the intermittent fasting
[210.32 - 214.60] have you gone to a medical nutritionist
[212.08 - 216.44] no do you have cholesterol problem yes
[214.60 - 219.00] are you doing the exercise under guided
[216.44 - 221.16] advice no you're not doing it so what
[219.00 - 223.24] are you doing you're winging it such
[221.16 - 225.96] people who are overweight and doing
[223.24 - 228.96] their own jugar are exposing their body
[225.96 - 232.28] to additional stress markers so I say to
[228.96 - 234.88] you do it correctly nobody will die from
[232.28 - 237.24] intermittent fasting the human race is
[234.88 - 239.40] eating too much it is the eating too
[237.24 - 242.56] much that has brought you to that level
[239.40 - 245.76] of higher weight higher metabolic marker
[242.56 - 248.88] disease higher incidences or risk ratio
[245.76 - 250.56] of cancer or heart attack because you're
[248.88 - 252.72] at that higher level people have now
[250.56 - 254.00] understood that intermittent fasting can
[252.72 - 257.16] bring you down but you're doing it in
[254.00 - 260.16] the wrong way and food for thought why
[257.16 - 263.28] is the media focusing on this because
[260.16 - 266.12] recently a stock market share was set to
[263.28 - 268.36] double in the e-commerce apps the food
[266.12 - 271.12] delivery apps by two and a half times in
[268.36 - 273.52] the next 5 years if whole of India is
[271.12 - 275.16] eating lesser and having a smaller
[273.52 - 277.80] eating window and doing intermittent
[275.16 - 280.28] fasting guess who's ordering lesser from
[277.80 - 281.92] the e-commerce apps you and me so what
[280.28 - 284.04] we're going to tell you we're going to
[281.92 - 285.84] run newspaper articles saying that
[284.04 - 289.00] intermittent fasting is the worst thing
[285.84 - 292.08] that you can do it is wrong take it from
[289.00 - 294.44] me I have helped thousands of people
[292.08 - 296.48] lose weight and not get heart attacks
[294.44 - 299.12] because they do it with medically sound
[296.48 - 301.64] guided advice with my team of dietitians
[299.12 - 303.60] they work with their certified trainers
[301.64 - 305.80] and I send them to cardiovascular
[303.60 - 308.80] doctors for constant checkups to see
[305.80 - 312.04] that they're keeping Pace with the whole
[308.80 - 313.44] medication for BP and the cardiovascular
[312.04 - 315.28] problem also in India a lot of people
[313.44 - 317.20] self-medicate so when the doctor gives
[315.28 - 318.96] medication you stop the medication so
[317.20 - 320.76] put all of this together take an
[318.96 - 323.68] informed decision and if you're doing
[320.76 - 325.24] the intermittent fasting don't stop
[323.68 - 327.84] first things first go to your
[325.24 - 329.92] cardiologist go to your metabolic doctor
[327.84 - 332.16] second go to a medical nutritionist and
[329.92 - 334.00] get your diet aligned for proper eating
[332.16 - 336.16] go slow and steady don't try to do it 3
[334.00 - 338.12] months try and do it in 3 years and
[336.16 - 340.16] above all work with a certified
[338.12 - 342.44] nutrition and get yourself exercise
[340.16 - 344.28] variables which can help you track your
[342.44 - 346.84] heart rate so you're actually working
[344.28 - 348.76] out in a proper State and you're not
[346.84 - 351.00] trying to push yourself in one hour of a
[348.76 - 353.68] crazy workout and better still if you
