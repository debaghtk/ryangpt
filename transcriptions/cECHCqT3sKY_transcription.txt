[1.80 - 6.36] a lot of times well for almost 15 years
[5.04 - 8.04] I've seen people make New Year's
[6.36 - 10.20] resolution did you make a U.S resolution
[8.04 - 12.00] well I'm sure you have and as I have
[10.20 - 14.22] done I've also made a newest resolution
[12.00 - 17.04] but over the years I've realized two
[14.22 - 18.54] things one when you make a learning
[17.04 - 20.22] solution write it down so you're
[18.54 - 22.62] accountable don't let it float in your
[20.22 - 25.74] head number two when you write down this
[22.62 - 28.02] resolution ask who can help me in this
[25.74 - 30.98] resolution if you make this resolution
[28.02 - 34.68] very private without your family friends
[30.98 - 37.44] or your nutritionist or your trainer or
[34.68 - 39.66] your mind coach or anybody else that can
[37.44 - 42.12] help you out with the goal you're more
[39.66 - 43.98] likely to not persevere in your goal
[42.12 - 46.14] because it's very private so what I
[43.98 - 47.58] suggest to you is if you plan on
[46.14 - 51.26] changing your health
[47.58 - 51.26] start with the way you eat
