I treat my body as a Rolls Royce and every year I get it tested to see how my engine is working.

Health checkups are a great way to forward forecasts and strategize preventive measures in case of any anomalies.  

Reports can help to customize nutrition strategies to be able to meet unique nutrition needs to boost health and healing.

I had a fun day out getting myself tested, learning new stuff and  at the end getting an A+ from the Doc.

The package includes a comprehensive list of tests at a very reasonable price.


If you want to get yourself tested (which I recommend that you should do) reach out to us at +91-9743430000.

Transcript: uh it's my birthday today and every year I do a health checkup so it's very very important that you do a diagnostic screening so I'm here uh to get everything done and checked up so come on join me inside as we go and start my medical checkup we are doing the entire test what things are mentioned here and is really really good so I'm going to get a complete scan of my internal organs things today yes so you can check that out that's the um men's stuff and that's the woman's stuff and I do an annual Health checkup is you know we service our cars we service our bikes we service our phones by the way you can change all of these devices right you can change your house you can change your phone you can change everything you can't change the human body so my perspective on my birthday today is I need to be able to um get get a checkup see that all systems are working well and then I superimpose great nutrition upon that because the human body has a self-healing mechanism so if you have any anomalies you can forward predict you can forward forecast what's happening in your body so join me today as I make this quick video and I'll show you what are the tests that I'm going to go through and then hopefully if you want to get these tests done reach out to me and we'll guide you to this wonderful city of Bangalore and how you can come in fly in get a testing done in half a day and um I'll diagnose your reports and figure out how we can change the way you eat all right so let's get a a stool sample today and a urine sample I've just given quick tip whenever you're doing your urine sample before you can come in for a health checkup or a blood test drink some water that will really help you about 1 hour prior to pass uh urine very easily because normally it's very cold and you get nervous and everything so so uh that's one thing second thing when you get the urine container before you pee both men and women open the container first keep it on the side right allow maybe 20 to 30 ml first of urine to pass then stop then take the cup and collect the urine okay especially in women the first pass may be contaminated so pee for a little bit so you need to have enough of water in you to get a consistent long flow ple and you have to squeeze your keegle muscles to stop your urine so whenever you know you're going for a blood test one week prior well just practice stop and go stop and go with your urine it's a lot of fun but don't spray it outside of the Basin for the men hi good morning please be seated we are at the place now where we are doing blood test now I you can do an annual Health checkup um which is very comprehensive on what I'm doing but I wouldest you know from my nutrition point of view I do a blood test every 6 months you want to look at your lipid Pro profiles you want to look at your liver profile you want to look at your kidney profile and uh the heart profile the heart profile normally has homosysteine C reactive protein uh lipoprotein A lipoprotein B now if you do that in a blood test and you find higher markers uh or abnormal out of range levels you can use diet to control it over a period of time but if it's high go get an annual check check up done look at your calcium CT score uh look at an angiography look at um ECG but go to the heart guy and get that done so let's get my blood test [Music] done your blood pressure machine left or right any hand which you feel [Music] Comfort okay so it's a little higher it should be 120 over 80 so 138 maybe I'm super excited today older your um your blood vessels your blood vessels get get um narrower because of plaque deposition or just aging so imagine your pipelines getting harder and so that that what's going to happen is that um the heart has to pump because the blood vessel is not remaining elastic so collagen vitamin C Arginine arginine is found in green peas uh tends to dilate blood vessels uh which means uh which means it makes it more elastic so it can help in dietary management of BP and the other thing that we're looking at is we're always going to be looking at maybe you know uh high salt in the diet because of high salt uh obviously the body retains more amount of water and because you retain more amount of water the heart has to pump a little harder and faster to circulate that entire fuel stuff that's some serious blood coming out when I say serious not from a volume perspective but from the nutrition in that blood it's probably got Arginine as a supplement phosphoserine as a supplement vitamin C um ashwag gandha chamomile te and six oranges this morning I'm I'm going to you okay perfect what is the what is the ECG electrocardiogram you're seing your like hard Rhythm okay you're searching the rhythm of my heart I think my heart beats very well they have the health checkup is they ask you to relax so you shouldn't be um stressed out uh it's something that everyone above the age of 30 I recommend that they do considering nowadays we have a lot of heart attacks and a lot of diabetes hypertension because we all have a runrunrun life right so uh do an annual Health checkup it's really important for you and your family members let's get started sister [Music] matches and what the other small yeah you are really fashionable hey everyone I'm doing a CP scan and we going to check my internal organs it's a low intensity city scan right low low do okay so it's a low do radiation CD scan and the idea is to check up how my organs are doing so you can't come in here because it's radiation so stay safe I'll see you at find C SC my lungs got I hold my breath and let me check my heart has blockages so hopefully good may be good as a nutritionist a nutritionist can't have a heart block let's see so if I could afford this machine I would have it in my clinic it's called the dexas scan it's the gold standard for measuring body mass in human physiology and what do I mean by that everyone says oh I'm high weight I'm low weight but in your weight you have bone density you have muscle density you have water density and you have fat density with the dexa I'm very interested of you doing it once a year not every month like some crazy people do because it's too much of radiation every month once a year do this test you'll know your visceral fat visceral fat is the fat around the organs your subcutaneous fat which is fat Under the Skin and then you have your bone mass all women above the age of 30 have to do a bone mineral density test because with estrogen with menopause coming in early in the 40s and 50s your bones can get brittle for men after the age of 50 so I'm going to get myself done and uh I don't think he's allowed to be inside right because of the radiation right so again you got to leave me and I will share my DEA scan reports with all of you cheers scan done now I don't know what is next so hi I at the final stage of my annual checkup and I got to get my oral health checked out now as a nutritionist I've always been telling people brush their teeth because there was a research paper I read which says that you know um if you have block formation and bad oral microbiome it can affect your gut microbiome and it can lead to more block deposition at the at the Heart level so I have here with me Dr nin so Dr Narin here is going to do my oral test why am I doing this so this is basically oral cancer screening process okay so here we'll take a look at your mouth oral hygiene plus if there are any signs for the cancer okay any ulcers or tumors or anything so likewise you can prevent it and how often should a person do this screening the screening is required once in 6 months at least you anyways will go for your normal cleaning right corre the dentist will have a look at your mouth and then when you do an annual checkup it's another six month when you're do it for it all right shall we get started sure sure please so 1 hour 23 minutes and my entire diagnostic check is done now all I have to do is go and meet the doctor for the results it's that quick come to me in Bangalore and I'll get this done here to meet the Doctor Who is going to either tell me I'm good bad or ugly one of the three uh in terms of is my health good and what can I do about it I have to figure it out as a nutritionist uh but I would say to you that look at your body assessment look at your blood test look at your preventive screening Diagnostics that's that's the way you want to check out if you know I believe I'm a I'm a Rolls Ro so I can't change this rolls
