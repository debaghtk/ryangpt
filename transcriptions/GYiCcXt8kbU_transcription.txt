[1.44 - 5.34] carbon footprint
[3.60 - 8.46] global warming
[5.34 - 10.14] nutrition all in the same breath
[8.46 - 12.60] I think I was reading an article about
[10.14 - 14.22] how people are vegetarian versus people
[12.60 - 16.26] who eat meat how meat consumes a more
[14.22 - 19.80] amount of water and planetary resources
[16.26 - 21.90] versus being vegetarian that's good but
[19.80 - 23.34] you know I'm a non-vegetarian and I'm
[21.90 - 25.50] trying to give it up but it's very tough
[23.34 - 28.02] so here's what I think I think we should
[25.50 - 30.66] do portion control eat less so
[28.02 - 32.88] because if you eat lesson there was an
[30.66 - 35.58] article recently have 50 percent of the
[32.88 - 37.74] world's population is obese 50 which
[35.58 - 39.66] means if five of us are in 10 of us are
[37.74 - 43.32] in the room five of us are fat and five
[39.66 - 45.36] of us are not fat that's global warming
[43.32 - 48.00] 50 of the population is overweight
[45.36 - 49.08] you're consuming more resources than you
[48.00 - 51.06] really need
[49.08 - 52.14] right imagine you go flying in your
[51.06 - 53.70] overweight
[52.14 - 55.74] you need more fuel for that plane to
[53.70 - 57.54] take off more carbon footprint I was
[55.74 - 60.12] recently told sir you're overweight I'm
[57.54 - 63.42] like who me my bags or me
[60.12 - 64.38] right so I think having a healthier body
[63.42 - 66.18] weight
[64.38 - 67.46] getting to know your muscle and fat
[66.18 - 69.48] percentage
[67.46 - 71.82] I think that's where you can start on
[69.48 - 76.28] the carbon footprint get lighter get
[71.82 - 76.28] fitter get stronger get greener
