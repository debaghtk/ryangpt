Transcript: the biggest misconception that people have yoga has to be a 24 by7 process I'm drinking this glass of water am I 100% involved with this process that's yoga which is why if you see a lot of yogis especially the ones who are living in the Himalayas they're not falling sick and the reason is that the and yoga is that you are not just functioning here as a piece of creation you can become the Creator himself good astrologer if they know you're a yogi they will never predict you because they know you have taken charge of your own life so those stars and planets don't make a difference in your life so why won't you want to spend those 45 minutes or 1 hour every day in this so all of this cold shower and emptying your bars and urination should be done before you start your practice always when you wake up first thing in the morning I want to be a medium where I can impart this and make a difference in others life because this is the only reality I know touted as one of the youngest and brightest pioneers of Yoga and Wellness in the country formerly a national swimming champion for 14 years schloka is an alumna of the prestigious Saint Sten college and the Delhi School of Economics as an Isha ha yoga teacher she's is committed to making sadguru's offerings of classical ha yoga available to a larger audience across the globe she regularly conducts yoga programs online I'm going to become a student of hers and in person at various destinations across around the world now shoka closely works with various corporate organizations like Ernest and Young Healthcare organization like Fortis and the all- India Institute of Medical sciences and various NOS giving them an unparallel opportunity to learn classical ha yoga in its full depth and vibrancy I'm excited to even learn from her she's also a yogic nutritionist something I want to quiz her about today and is also a diet and lifestyle expert schloka welcome to my podcast thank you it's a pleasure to be here you know Delhi School of economics and now a yogic guru what was the journey and how did it start it was one of inadequacy actually um um I've been the only child and being the only child and coming from a middle class family so I've been a 4G kid as I was mentioning to you uh my parents put me into a lot of things so I'm a trained pianist I was a swimmer I learned batnam dancing and I did reasonably well in whatever I did and then they came a point where despite being recognized as an achiever I didn't feel full within me so there's always an aspiration for a parent and I was an extension of that aspiration but when I came off age and Life Point you have done the tick mark all the check boxes all the check boxes followed that social script you're sitting here and you're not feeling good about yourself and I was between jobs and I was constantly changing my field of study and um changing jobs thinking the next best thing is going to give me that sense of satisfaction and contentment and not really quite sticking on with anything I was between jobs when my mother egged me to do this inner engineering program which is a flagship program of the ISA foundation and I was living in Bangalore in banata Road and I said t let's go there was no looking back thereafter uh so there is a particular meditation that one gets initiated into it's called The shambhu mahamudra Meditation I didn't have an earth shattering experience usually people say now meditation so you transcend and you know get into a different Zone nothing of that sort happened to me but I still remember that that particular day was one of the happiest days of my life and it just felt life was was at ease it was effortless for that one day it was just Ser it was Serene it was calm there was no tension for that one day and nothing significant happened on that day and since then it was just doing one program after the other and then coming to a point where I realized that I want to be a medium where I can impart this and make a difference in others life because this is the only reality I know and that is how my journey as a yoga teacher came about amazing so I I want to get a little bit deeper because you know I do a little bit of yoga I can't meditate my breath coach my breath coach works with me and he guides me through the meditation and I have a very flippant mindset it's it's it's a jumpy mindset so I I'm an always in awe of people who are yoga teachers people who teach meditation people who do meditation themselves so can you enlighten me on some of the modernday yogi rituals that all all a lot of us should aspire to or start doing to have this sort of not Nirvana but that Serene moment that you achieved firstly you would be surprised to know that I'm diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and I've taken medications for a brief period of my life I wouldn't have noticed that in today's podcast at all you're very calm so um and perhaps I lived with it I don't know but I was a sports person so I think a lot of that got worked out um when we say yoga the literal meaning of the word yoga is Union right it is not an exercise form as it is made out to be it's an experiential reality so when we say Union there is always an element of involvement there is a misunderstanding among many if you're doing one hour of yoga and going about with your day you've done your daily quota of yoga but that's not the case yoga has to be a moment to moment reality every moment I should be in yoga because if yoga literally means Union I cannot read about Union I can't do Union I can only experience Union and Union has to be a moment to moment reality so in this moment I'm having a conversation with you am I in yoga am I completely involved with you without any discrimination without any judg J ments that is Yoga I'm drinking this glass of water am I 100% involved with this process that's yoga doing the ASAS twisting and turning your body is just catalyzing the process but it doesn't stop there so that's the biggest misconception that people have yoga has to be a 24x7 process so that's the first thing having said said that there are various prescriptions uh which facilitate the state of involvement the first thing being waking up at Braham hurat what is Brahma Murat Brahma Murat would be considered the last quarter of the night which is anywhere between 3:30 a.m. to 5:30 or 6:00 a.m. scientifically we say that the pineal gland is working at its best the secretion of the Pinal gland the Melatonin the all of them are working at its maximum which means that being in a pleasant mood within yourself is not a problem also I believe that the nature is aligned the planets are aligned in such a manner that it creates a conducive state for you to sort of grasp anything or for you to be in a certain balanced state so typically we would utilize this time period in fact there is another study which shows that the quality of your urine is very different at this particular time in comparison to any time any other time during the day so the idea is to wake up and do a practice that you have been initiated into now when we say initiation it's about learning a yoga practice which affects your pronic system which affects your Energy System what is pronic system so there are multiple bodies within a human system so there is a physical body which is the anosha or the food body there is the manoosha or the Mind Body there is a Prana mosha which is the energy body and there is the vigana mosha I don't know the English equivalent of that knowledge body not quite vigana mosha and Anand mosha which is the Bliss body so what yoga is doing is that it goes to the pranay kosha which is the energy body and the help of a guru comes where you have to be pushed from the pranam kosha to the other dimensions further up Vian kosha Anand kosha that a guru can do for you which is why having a guru in your life becomes important but any teacher Any teacher who's been trained who has some good intention for you can take you to pranam kosha once the pranam kosha or the energy body is activated it you will see that its benefits permeate down to the mental body so your mind is great and the physical body which is why if you see a lot of yogis especially the ones who are living in the Himalayas or somewhere let's say in the forest they don't know what they're eating they don't know what they're drinking there are minor poisons coming into their food and water all the time but you'll see that they're in great physical health their sleep qua is very Less in fact they don't even sleep there is a culture among so many yogis where they don't sleep at all because we say that sleep is a form of inertia and you want to reduce that to the best possible extent now they're not falling sick and the reason is that the pranam kosha or the energy body is fully activated and is in full flow so this is what uh the pranam myosha is so when you wake up in the morning and do your spiritual work or your sadhana as we say your yoga practice it activates your pranam mosha which means that your mind will be great and your body will be perfect before that we say You must take a shower in the morning and a cold water shower preferably uh I was going to ask you about that because a lot of people do take a warm water bath in the morning and so how does the how did the different bodies join together with the cold shower so when we say cold shower we're not looking like we're not looking at uh a temperature which is very very cold uh this would be anywhere say 5 to 8° Centigrade below the room temperature and this is simply because scientifically speaking we say that there are poses between the cells and when you take a cold water shower that opens up and energy begins to permeate it enters and it recharges the cellular structure so as a result of which you're much more energized you can do your sadh without you know feeling drowsy and if it's let's say you're living in cold climatic conditions then we say lukewarm water but never hot water because the hot water opens up the cells and it creates inertia and drowsiness now for a regular individuals who's not into yoga sadna it may not matter but for a yogi who is staying up for a long time who's doing about 4 hours of sadna it can become problematic additionally I think there is a lot of literature Now by Andrew huberman for example who has extensively researched on the importance of the dopamine release correct so uh so K sha becomes very important in the life of a yogi and we always say that you start from here and then allow the water to trickle down after that the most important thing is emptying your bows first thing when you wake up so in all of this cold shower and empting your balls and urination should be done before you start your practice always when you wake up first thing in the morning so in traditional Sciences B Yoga ayurveda we say that the headquarter of most diseases is the colon 90% of the diseases that we know chronic or otherwise is in the colon PID sa not just PID sa are you able to completely evacuate your BS so we say it should be as clean as a water pipe in fact there's a culture among the yogis a certain sect of yogis where they use the anal cavity as a suction pipe they suck the water in they'll sit in a pool of water suck it in and then Purge it through their mouth and it's squeaky clean wow so colon health is very very important gut health becomes very important and doing your practices on an empty stomach becomes important because there is a certain ascendance of energy when you're doing your sadh you will feel that as you become more sensitive and aware that the Energy starts moving upwards there is feces it's going to get blocked so this is why as a sports nutritionist I've always never been able to understand why yogig don't sip any sports drink or protein powder or anything before their yoga practice even though it's very intensive it's because that chakras or those energy is com in from the essence of your core am I right in that they could come from the lower Dimensions we don't know what that Dimensions is that would be dependent on your state of evolution my CH my energy could start from here yours could start from here we don't know but the idea is that there is a certain upward movement and we don't want to and putting food in at that time kind of hinders hinders you from discovering it or tapping into your best energy source and allowing it to move upward essentially speaking of energy you know um I am ignorant of AA I read but I'm not a trained expert I'm a nutritionist and you hear this word kapap and then doas so I want to start off with what are doas and are these building blocks then can that can determine what diet and lifestyle can follow so as a yogic instructor give me your take on that yoga and ayurveda are good together but they do diverge at several places because again ayurva was meant for a different audience yogis have still a different set of prescriptions and you'll see at a lot of places and I get this question a lot because we do this online diet yogic diet program and when I talk about certain things they turn around and say oh but ayurva says this and I said they're not the same Sciences they're very different talking about ayurva vak kafa is predominantly an aurvedic construct they also known as practis practis are Constitution so either I could have a Vata prti or a p prri is like a constitution Constitution okay what are these Constitution uh what is the Constitution these are certain factors which come together to decide how my physiology functions body and the mind who decides this your genes your genetic your DNA what you inherited from yog I should discover this myself or my yogic instructor will kind of look at me and tell me what is my um what is my composition a an ayurvedic doctor do something called nari parik so they check your naris it's not a pulse they'll check your naris and they'll see what is on with that so what is viated where is the problem is Vata down is kafa down and they'll be able to diagnose you and tell you what your Constitution is again with um India in general losing its spiritual pulse and a lot of people thinking b m degree and we become AIC doctors you know let me start prescribing a lot of that awareness is getting lost so an AIC doctor will check your pulse and they'll be able to diagnose you a yogi or a yoga practitioner may not necessarily need that because they'll have that sense inherently so to answer your question it works both ways it depends on how aware you are and how sensitive you are about your own system got it so it's very interesting because what I'm hearing and feeling of you is that you vibrate at a certain frequency that's the language that I understand and food vibrates at a certain frequency and you're able to become aware of what you should or should not be putting into your body now holding on that thought what's your viewpoint on fruits and vegetables as an individual and as a yogic instructor to your students the fruit and vegetables do I do a fruit salad do I do juices what's your take on that so it is okay to put a blanket judgment in my understanding um and say that fruits is something everybody can consume because what it does fundamentally is that it ignites your digestive fire which we call as AG or jhat AG so in yoga we say 30% of your diet should be fruits and a certain amount I don't think we're doing that in today's day in the world lot of processed food no fruits at all we eat one fruit and we think that you know it's enough so sorry 30% is fruit 30% is fruits and we say that the remainder can be remainder 20% can be your salad so 50% raw food and 50% cooked food is the kind of ratio that we would take as far as consumption of fruits are concerned uh it is always best if it is consumed Standalone and it is always best that if you leave a certain gap between let's say your fruit and the remainder of your meal let's say one and a one one to 1 and a half hours Gap even between fruit and salad it is advisable that you leave at least half to 1 hour gap why because the digestive times of both of these are very different I totally agree with that and that's I've always practiced that in my clinical practice it's from Common Sense logic an apple would digest at different rate as compared to say a cucumber or a salad Leaf the sugar content in an apple is different from the cellulose content in in a vegetable so the water content water content yes absolutely so it's very interesting that ancient Indian practices have directed us to understand our energy and understand our foods and the digestion energy that comes out of that so that's something that's very interesting speaking of digestion the other part of digestion fasting we talk about the Circadian Rhythm I do genetic testing of the Circadian rhythm some people are morning clocks some people are evening clocks as a yogic instructor what are your teachings and what are your learnings from sadguru's point of view on fasting and if it is encouraged how can the human race cuz I always reflect this that the human race is eating too much of food today but to tell them to fast is like asking them to give up uh you know their car or giving up hot water shs fasting is something very delicate what's your take on fasting so in ayurva there is a term called langana param aadam which means that again Lana aadam okay which means fasting is the ultimate medicine powerful very important both Aura and yoga would endorse it how we would do it is there something called ekadashi which comes about once in 15 days in about 40 to 48 days you would experience based on the moon cycle I keep hearing this term from my clients ekadashi ekadashi so I was like aashi and I was thinking okay one time I'm going to fast like they're negotiating with me but now I understand it's like that Luna cycle period that you get into it I am not very sure astrologically what's happening up there but I do know that there are certain alignments in the cosmic space where so is there a calendar for this so I can Google up which which day is ekadashi and then do the absolutely the lunar calendar okay so certain factors these alignments do you fast on that day I do and and your fast is like no water also you have water no no I have water okay any other Foods allowed in the akadashi day I would think cucumber so that would again depend on where the person is how comfortable the individual is fasting because you never want to force the first person to fast so let's say they're into Yoga practices and they're able to fast like you're a veteran and you can just go all out but if you're a novice you're kind of flexible and stuff like that yes so we say you do a fahar or a fruit diet if you're not comfortable fasting and if you feel hungry in between then you can have an amla with let's say some salt because it tends to curb the hunger pangs otherwise it is fasting let's say aachis tomorrow I've had my dinner today I'm not going to be eating Hereafter and I will break my fasting with the meal that I have tomorrow which would be something light let's say kanji kitri uh papaya very light foods but otherwise you have water in in yoga we also have NE and turmeric early in the morning like raw NE leaves and a balll of turmeric we'll have that we'll take a little honey laed water in the morning and you're having you're doing your regular work so that is fasting awesome would you as a yogic instructor do 2 three days in a row no why only because it isn't prescribed and internally uh I haven't felt the need to because as yoga practitioners we're only eating two times a day so in any case you are following a sort of intermittent fasting schedule so I'm eating let's say the first meal is between 10 and 11 and the second meal is between 7 and 8 it's it's a full meal and let's say if I am into intense physical activity then in the afternoon I might take a fruit so eat eat to Your Capacity don't overeat is part of the yogic practice um speaking of eating to our heart's contempt you know I get I'm a huge prescription nutritionist for raw fruits and raw vegetables as you said um what's your take on the raw veggies and when if you you know you're a yogic nutritionist when would you prescribe okay this is the time for you to eat raw vegetables raw vegetables great for the gut in fact uh I think some nutritionist somewhere had mentioned that it acts like a brush in your system you know the the toilet brush it comes and it cleanses because of the fiber content cont the water content yes uh the only time this becomes uh we need to exercise some caution is if there's an individual with a weak digestive system let's say an IBS or a Vata prri let's say if the element of vayu a person with a Vata prri would have more of the air element you know they would be gassy they would be leaning towards constipation or diarrhea the extreme so we would say you exercise caution uh but otherwise there's no problem um and we would say before meals not not with meals again the digestive times are very different so a salad a raw food always gets digested quickly viser a cooked meal so you have it first leave a gap if you can otherwise have the fruits have the fruits and the salad first and then follow that up with cooked meals and we say any individual above the age of 30 should have two meals a day because your metabolic fire keeps going down you can't give it the same amount of meal as you were when you were in your 20s and also because we have to maintain an empty stomach condition for our sad you know shloka is very very interesting I'm not formally trained in aura or yogic science or anything I'm trained in Medical Nutrition and when we slap on the continuous glucose monitoring device these small devices that monitor your blood glucose levels I have seen patients and clients when we do the raw vegetable first and then we do the protein and then we do the grain the glucose spike is actually the least okay so there is an ancient wisdom and Truth which which are sages discovered without any of this technology so what you're actually seeing actually resonates with me where I tell people start with a salad first so my mom and me always have this argument she's born in the Portuguese culture where we do soup first and soup is cooked vegetable and I say no no let's do salad first then we do the soup and then we do the grain which is the bread or the rice with a little bit of your lentils or your DS and so there is ancient wisdom over there and the C GM devices actually prove that so I mean it'll be very interesting to put a CGM device on you and see how your blood sugar level never fluctuates um speaking about fluctuating levels in the human body I always practice as a judge of food I never take a side I never take a negative or a positive I'm never the prosecutor defendant in yogic and yoga instructors and ayic specialist and this whole spirituality of diet perspective in India what's your take on milk H ayurveda as a science is completely form milk in fact it's supposed to be life a Giver of Life so from the cow's milk to the Camel's milk to the buffalo's milk to the donkey milk to the goats goats milk if you go back into the shastras all these traditional texts for every disease there will be one milk that will be prescribed so out of all of these the cow's milk is supposed to be not just the most sacred but also best in terms of nutrition because the DNA of AA and the human is very close both in yoga and in Aura we've concluded this so it's next to the breast milk uh so cow's milk and that to the grass-fed cow the A2 not the hybrid cow the A2 the Indian grass-fed cow in yoga it's a no because it is believed uh I don't know whether there's any science packing this up but this is purely uh like I mentioned it's an experiential science so the yogis know what what happening within your system through awareness the enzymes of milk are sticky in nature we in fact say that it's used as an adhesive in the in the industry in the textile industry so when it enters you it sticks to the colon as a result of which you get constipated now constipation may not be that my stools are hard but it's just that it's preventing that complete evacuation which is preventing my gut to be squeaky clean and for a yoga practitioner like I mentioned that's the most important thing because the gut is connected with your mind now you want the meditator to sit in meditation for perhaps even hours with an unclean gut it's going to impact the mind and it's going to be that's the latest in medical science today where we have the Mind gut connection which I think the yogic incapacity is the name of my clinic qua so the yogic resonate from discovering their qua for every food so that's like you know I mean we had to go to Medical Science to learn this and study this but this is really nice because it's like you're I feel you're like a magnet and you're vibrating at a frequency and then you know what food you put into you and does that food vibrate with you or does that food vibrate against you so that's something really nice you know my team of researchers they put together some nice questions so I have no idea what I'm asking you right now but what is virud aara and what do I need to be educated about it and what are the mistakes we the making the most about so viru means incompatible and ahara means food so viru ahar are combinations of incompatible food so in traditional Sciences such as yoga we say that in your plate you shouldn't have more than two or three food items because if it is any more than that it would manifest in the form of diseases so not just you should not just limit yourself to those two to three food items but also ensure that they're compatible they go along with one another so one of the classic incompat combinations that most of us follow these days is hot and cold water P I don't have the time I'm rushing for work and then I just put some cold water and dilute it that's verar for you right there milk and fish milk and any other meat item so the chicken biryani is actually disastrous for the system because one is that chicken and rice don't go together both are high on fats and the other is they marinate the chicken with thei these days with kurd you have it with raita sometimes so compatible combinations uh honey should never be heated we say whenever honey is heated it crosses a certain temperature it becomes poisonous so you never cook in honey you should just ensure that when your uh water is maybe slightly cooler or let's say in lukewarm that is when you lace it with a little bit of honey uh there are several such you know incompatible food combinations another one being milk and fruits so fruit milkshakes are the worst thing and banana milkshake is the the worst of them all very very highly in incompatible with each other and uh we say in yogic sciences that one reason allergies are on a rise is because of these incompatible food combinations so you know that's very interesting because you know when I practice as a medical nutritionist and a sports nutritionist one key driver at the back of my head is not academics or scientific study it's Common Sense logic very similar to this virud aara which is if you lived 500 years ago we didn't have supermarkets we didn't have yearlong availability we ate in Simplicity one or two items on our plate we didn't have a buffet on a plate and I think this concept of gastronomy explosion and mixing pallets and mixing foods and affluence yeah affluence I mean we human RAC is eating more than it requires so I think this is this is a concept that if we could convince people to go back to our roots and just use common sense like I tell people and people say that what what should I drink and I just say drink water cuz if you and I lived a thousand years ago we went to a stream and we collected the water and we drank water it's as simple as that but today you have milk you have almond milk you have coconut milk you have tea you have coffee you have milkshake you have this shake you have that shake you have this beverage that tree and I don't think we need to mix all of these things and now I'm beginning to understand your sense of the vibration of the cosmos the vibration of the human body and the vibration of food so you can be a body that has to vibrate with the cosmos right do all your yogic practice but you could poison that practice when you put the wrong food as it vibrates inside of you so it all begins with the food body and then you go upwards I've learned something today in terms of I would like to call it the quantum energy signature of our existence on the planet and each one of us vibrate at a certain frequency and when you get your spiritual body or your pric body or whichever bodies that you talked about to vibrate one after the other just putting the wrong Foods in your body causes those vibrations to clash with absolutely So speaking about vibrations and clashing the human race is contaminating the human body it's not treating it as as holy vessel what are some of the things as a yogic instructor you would give to me as advice or your students as advice in terms of detoxifying the body so obviously yes there will be a lot of exercises that you could do tell me some of those and from a detox point of view and a food point of view what would you do as a yogic nutritionist uh when it comes to the Yoga practices yoga um Works in entirety yoga will never just look at your kidneys or just look at your spine yes there are certain practices that could uh stress on that faculty of your system and work towards impacting that but it's always holistic because here the idea is not with the body it goes beyond that so even if let's say we do a practice called yoga namaskar which is great for the spine but you will see overall you'll see a very good bowel movement with that as well so for me to pinpoint and say that a particular practice will cause a certain benefit would be incorrect but in terms of the food aspect um the first thing is the classic warm water with nimbu or with lemon it helps to flush out the toxins from the kidney that's the first the second would be the fenugreek and the jira water so this is an Aur tip uh here we take about say 1 teaspoon of fenri half teaspoon of jira and you soak it in water overnight let's say 150 to 200 mL of water overnight in the morning you SE out the seeds and you drink that very good for diabetics as well because it controls the sugar levels this is a great detox drink however if you're doing the yoga practice then you ensure that you're consuming this one and a half hours before the yoga practice 1 and a half hour before before if you're not doing the yoga practice you can consume it immediately so if somebody gets up yeah Evacuate the bows has a cold shower drink the water then wake I would say drink the water because it also helps with the peristaltic movements got it got it but I then I still need to wait for one and a half hour so if I want to do my yoga practice at 6:00 in the morning I got to be getting up at around 4:00 a.m. in the morning 4:00 a.m. which is why for yoga practitioners we don't even suggest these we say have your warm water lace it with a little bit of Honey because you need that for cellular recharge and to create flexibility in the muscles and then you leave no Gap at all because you've just laced your drink with a little bit of Honey which means you haven't disrupted the empty stomach condition mhm and then you have we take about one if you if you get ne leaves we say you have the neem leaves seven or eight neem leaves with one ball of turmeric so it helps to cleanse the colon again the digestive system and then you start your yoga practice immediately awesome awesome um I've been plagued by a cough I've tried everything possible for the last one month my favorites are Tuli my it is manuka honey which has an antibiotic in it naturally um jamun honey uh two a lot of warm water a lot of green teas a lot of K and all but before you came on my team gave me this and it's like there are there stuff in yoga and Avea that you can do so what's the tip master that you can give me in terms of getting cough colds fevers and everybody out there suffering from these coughs and cold what's our ancient wisdom in and yogic practice have to say a without a doubt it has to be a yogic practice in your life every single day I had acute bronchitis as a child growing up and I used to have this fitis which is you know the the certain things inflammation and then you know the throat paining and every were your tons removed no they weren't remove which is why I was put into swimming actually on the behest of a doctor but nonetheless after I left swimming and after I began working I used to frequently have sore throat and this part always remained very uh vulnerable 2017 is when I started yoga I haven't looked back I've not had a about of fever I think in the last 67 years and maybe the only time I fell down was when I took the vaccine maybe matter of few hours and I sweat it out I recently went skiing when I was at a retreat doing a retreat in Kashmir and uh I experienced this for a brief period of time I just had some warm water next day I did my Shakti Chala I was fine you did your Shakti Chala now that's a form of pranay which I recommend to individuals particularly who have a very sensitive how is that to teach to a person uh it is a residential program so firstly these programs don't happen online because you manipulate someone's Energy System so if you're if I'm teaching something online and if you go or I with the instruction then anything which is powerful is always subtle so it could create well-being or it could create ill beinging so one thing that I always tell individuals is don't try to read a book and do yoga don't try to watch something and do yoga get initiated into it if I had to learn this in a residential program how much time would it take this would take about 4 days and this happens at the ISA foundation so even I'm not trained to teach that it the certain teachers the name of that again it's called the shaki chal Kaa and for the uninitiated like me out there what does it involve you must have heard of things like the kapalabhati for example and various others I don't have the correct jargon for that but there are steps so it's about a 40 to a 60 Minute process that you do but it's a complete practice in itself I'm a huge believer because currently the Wim Hof method it's very famous breath work scientist who has challenged Medical Science by them inserting every possible virus into him and all he did was use breath work he's a deep sea diver holds his breath like for five or six minutes and um he's able to defeat every possible virus and so there is s ific truth in breath work and I'm going to be doing this shortly if you had to summarize our our learning and our time together what are three things that you would advise me to do as an individual you got only three things to give me as a gift and you got only three things to give my listeners as a gift you are schloka the yogic practitioner the yogic nutritionist what are those three things that you would give away it's like we stuck on an island and we can't get anything else from you except these three gifts involvement with life okay learning to keep your likes and dislikes aside I think they go together because I can only be involved with something if I keep my likes and dislikes aside otherwise if I like something I'll be involved if I dislike something I will not be involved so tread the path of neutrality I would say involvement not even neutrality because again there a there's a bias there okay uh just throw your yourself and whatever lies in front of you right now 100% just that's karma yoga for you any task that I have at hand right now this can be yoga I'm doing sadhana right now if I'm 100% involved with you I'm throwing myself in this work that is number one number two would be to have to bring in some kind of a yoga practice in your life very important and the stems from the fact that this is not just your physical health all of that is a byproduct of yoga back I've had people surgery dates have been booked they've walked out of the need forever people have dropped their medications hypertensive medications in the retreat in the 4-day 5day retreat thyroid medications all of that will happen but the idea behind yoga is that you are not just functioning here as a piece of creation you're not like the any you're not like this plant you're not like any other dog on the street you can become the Creator himself you can become a master of your destiny because now you have a hold over your innermost core which is the maker of life so for example in in we say this that um anytime you go to an astrologer You Know M Kali this is my chart now you predict and if the astrologer knows a good astrologer if they know you're a yogi they will never predict you because they know you have taken charge of your own life so those stars and planets don't make a difference in your life so why won't you want to spend those 45 minutes or 1 hour every day in this powerful words very very powerful words thank you so much Loca for your wisdom today it a pleasure hosting you today on thank you so much likewise
