Title: Revealing secrets of pharma companies - vitamin C and atherosclerosis

Description: Get in touch with me ðŸ‘‡ Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiovascular health, and its potential impact on atherosclerosis has been a subject of interest in scientific studies. Atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in arterial walls, is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Vitamin C is renowned for its antioxidant properties, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammationâ€”two key factors in the development of atherosclerosis. Moreover, vitamin C is involved in the synthesis of collagen, a structural protein essential for maintaining the integrity of blood vessels. Research suggests that adequate vitamin C levels may contribute to healthier arteries by preventing the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a process that initiates plaque formation. While more research is needed to fully understand the nuanced relationship between vitamin C and atherosclerosis, incorporating vitamin C-rich foods into a balanced diet is a sensible nutritional strategy for supporting cardiovascular health.

[0.08 - 5.88] I eat a bowl of guava AMU every day in
[3.04 - 8.52] the 1960s there was a research done on
[5.88 - 10.48] the legs of people with arthrosclerosis
[8.52 - 13.28] and heart problem what the researchers
[10.48 - 16.00] found out is that the high doses of
[13.28 - 18.44] Vitamin C was able to keep the arteries
[16.00 - 20.24] clear of any blockages even in the legs
[18.44 - 22.76] this paper was swept under the rug in
[20.24 - 25.52] the 60s because the farmer industry did
[22.76 - 28.08] not want you to know that high dosing of
[25.52 - 30.96] vitamin C actually keeps your arteries
[28.08 - 33.88] clean one guava five oranges start
