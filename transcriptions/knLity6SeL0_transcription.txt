Transcript: you trained ranir Kapoor in that role but could you just tell us like how intense did it get when we started we were nowhere close to that so somewhere it had to start literally from Basics it can be achieved in a smaller time frame but it's not the healthiest way to approach it I know certain film stars even in the ' 80s who work out I needed to you know be in shape and started going to the gym what is it that one drives them to work out is it that celebrity paycheck that getting one F day the doctor just said you know we need to check you for osteoporosis then I started reading that stress excessive stress is somewhere connected to most of the lifestyle diseases and this we talking about cancer you know Cristiano Ronaldo says discipline but these guys have willpower so is there some sort of Mantra I Can chant or some beads I can wear yes there is a beautiful Mantra You Can chant because you believe in manifestation so the Mantra is I will not exercise but I can take care of the mind it does not work other way around also I can eat the healthiest of foods I can exercise regularly but I will not take care of the mind and the biggest reason for the elevated levels of Stress and Anxiety is one [Music] second I'm beyond excited to bring to you an inspiring conversation not with one guest with two guests and this is a Powerhouse couple shivoham and rinda we

don't think any other couple on the planet has that blessed totally blessed and that is something which is really really needed I know it is really needed uh before we get started I ask every one of my guests to say cheers but mine is the healthy cheers so I've got a shot of aloe vera juice now if you're allergic to aloe vera juice then you're not doing the shot but as a nutritionist aloe vera heals the stomach lining I don't think we need any healing today but let's just say cheers absolutely absolutely we have it every morning well you do have it every morning aloe vera wheat grass amla and Healy uh and that's the perfect combination so have beautiful health and mind and well it's all it's all her Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers now that we hydrated with some good stuff liquids in of us where do I start India's most powerful couple from from a perspective of that's what wealth is today you have the greatest amount of health and that's why you get your power sham you brought CrossFit to India it's a very powerful kind of exercise I did CrossFit for 2 days and then after that I was like this is not for me so before I get to your beautiful wife and pick her brains because of the mind power that she has CrossFit you're a fit guy what is it and why did you bring CrossFit to India and what's your take on it so I um I was training already in Melbourne I was a personal Fitness coach already in Melbourne and I had a trainer everybody needs a trainer if everybody wants to get better you need a mentor you need a guide you need a trainer in some way or the other so I told him I want to learn handstands and month one month two month three we're trying just not getting it so one day we were on uh Google just looking up how to improve handstands and this crazy website opened up crossfit.com and we're like wow what is this website it looks kind of crazy very simple at that time there was the the websites it was literally like a simple blog just like a WordPress blog there was nothing there was no pictures nothing there was just the workout written maybe a small screenshot of some workout that's about it and I said looks interesting let's let's try it and the first workout we did was uh called Nate which was 20 minutes as many rounds as possible of two muscleups for what are muscleups so muscleups is basically something where you kind of do a p up and then then you get over the bar and press like a gymnastic move basically yeah so muscle up two muscle ups four handstand push-ups and um eight Kettle belt swings that was my first workout 10 minutes into that workout I was blown away I was already throwing up in this big bin in Fitness First and people were wondering what the hell's going on and I was like oh my god I think I'm I think I found my thing this is this is this is it and that was the last day I probably remember doing any bicep curls or anything for like 15 years it was just CrossFit I don't know what it was but it it I think the reason why I loved it so much was probably because of the movements they were so beautiful when done correctly they make you feel very different but more than anything in those 20 minutes or 15 minutes or 10 minutes or whatever the length of the workout was you could not think about anything else but the next rep all that is going through my head is Warrior mode it I would say definitely it would be a warrior Yogi mode like literally there was it was you're at it you're sweating you're you're grunting your whatever I never grunted in my workouts I remember I still don't but it literally did it allowed you to be in a space which was you could say it's like it's your cave you know your your space it didn't it literally didn't no matter what worry you you had in the world World it for those 20 minutes it just did not exist it was insane for 15 years I've done it the boxes franchises training clients training trainers I still do a lot of programming in CrossFit for a lot of clients and I absolutely love the movements that I've learned through CrossFit the power cleans the muscle ups the handstands a lot of movements which already existed they were just brought together by the founder of CrossFit to make it made it into this program but I feel that this was and this is like 15 years 20 years back almost but I feel that today and this is my perspective I can be wrong people have their own perspective but I feel that today my body is not the same just like what we were talking earlier about our bodies evolve over time things change you're not the same person how you were maybe even two years down the line uh two years back so today I feel CrossFit is definitely not the intensity of CrossFit is not a kind of intensity or workout that I can put my body through the healing is a little bit slower um you know it's not it's not ideal because I'm not competing anymore I'm not training for a goal at that time I was training for the CrossFit Games and I did all of that so the athlete mode was always there and vinda has taught me that to become a good coach you somewhere need to get out of that athlete mode you need to see yourself as a coach that competitiveness and all of that because I've been an all my life in National level swimmer water polo Captain all of that I've done all that so literally that athlete mode has always been there but to become a good coach to become a really good coach and for people to see you as a coach not an athlete you need to First transform yourself from that mentality of being an athlete to becoming a coach so I think from a coach perspective I still do a lot of the movements from Crossfit I do my deadlifts I do my cleans all of that I incorporate them in my work out but at a more I would say lower intensity so shiv basically what I'm hearing from you is that one there are different workouts and there's a certain time for you to do that workout in your life absolutely and it's very important that the coach who's coaching you should be able to kind of figure out your frequency absolutely but I love one concept where you said Warrior Yogi uh and and speaking of Yogi you said you go into a cave in your mind and you're just with any workout that you are there at that point in life now I do karate and when I do karate it's absolute Bliss for 60 Minutes corre even though you're sweating and you know well not puking in a bucket but uh you know it's it's at that so rinda I wanted to pick your mind on this part as a mind coach as a person who coaches people from mental grit motivation you know the law of attraction as we spoke earlier and I'm a huge believer of it I find all my clients giving me D Mara excuses so Shivam over here is a fit guy he's a former athlete he's a trainer he's a coach today but you and I sit in a counseling room and people come to us in the diet or the exercise or in your case the Mind space and say I can't do it where do we start to let people understand that the most powerful organ in the human body sorry is not the muscle no no no I I agree with it's the mind I agree with you 110% Ryan because when I started my career I started as a physical fitness coach and a dietician oh you were a physical fitness coach and a dietician yes so I actually met at her Studio she used to have a studio what was love at first sight uh later later no it wasn't it was a spiritual bond at first sight I would say but coming back to I started as a physical fitness coach that's what I was telling you earlier uh and over time literally in three or four years I start I was one of the first female fitness coaches in the country this is 1998 so and came to Mumbai got very lucky got blessed with great clients started training Mr batan in physical fitness in the year 2000 one second yeah I thought he trained Mr batan and Ki no no now he does it but I was his first physical Fitness coach so you were the first physical fitness Co wow yes and I've been training him since for 24 years now I train the mind and he does the body okay but uh yes so as I moved along and of course nutrition and exercise are inseparable they both have to go hand in hand and my journey actually started when I was a teenager and I had to lose weight so did everything wrong got osteoporosis at the age of 1920 and then how did you how did you know you had osteoporosis it diagnosed a story that is a story because I could not walk suddenly One Fine Day not one fine day it started deteriorating over time and I could not walk straight I started limping my whole body would go into spasms it would take me 30 seconds to move from one side of the bed to the other just turn side and bed and nobody could figure out because I was so young and there was no awareness at that point of time about good nutrition and proper exercise so I used to just watch those Jane Fonda video tapes used to be there and nutrition only thing Ryan at that point of time was no fat remove the fat everything has to be fat free that was a decade of slim milk yes and no protein so only carb only high carb diet that's all he's supposed to have so I actually unfortunately had boiled vegetables for seven years so lost all the weight lost Oodles of weight and lost my health which uh when I figured out that the one find day the doctor just said that you know we need to check you for osteoporosis which is very unlikely doesn't happen to young people but let's check and when they found out yes they said if you sneeze too loudly your literally your ribs are going to crack so be very very careful so that's the time when I realized that hello health is way more important than just Aesthetics and I decided okay when I came to Mumbai I said I'm going to learn understand nutrition I'm going to understand sensible training and that was it and the journey was going fine with that and then very uh literally in by 2003 or 4 my father who was always into healthy eating and he was uh always exercising very fit no Vibes whatso no bad habits what vies whatsoever and uh he was diagnosed with cancer and then my brother's son was diagnosed with cancer I was wondering no what could a child do wrong it's not about diet and exercise for the child and my my father did everything right why did he fall sick so that is when I started going deeper into the Mind mind was somewhere always coming along as completing the picture but then mind became a bigger Focus then I started reading that stress excessive stress is somewh connected to most of the lifestyle diseases and this we talking about cancer so started reading more about it started uh understanding the yogic scriptures reading the yogic scriptures and around this time I came across the power of human mind uh which was I always believed in it there was a book called The Power of the subconscious mind by Dr Murphy and I read it and I was just blown away I was like oh my God and then when I reflected back in how I got the weight loss or how I did anything it started with the mind so when I'm saying mind people are people have a very vague concept when I say mind people think moods I'm saying yes moods is something that you learn the stress and anxiety something that you learn in the beginning yes how to handle it on a day-to-day basis how to minimize it because they both have a function in the body but when I'm saying mind I'm saying skills that the mind has the first is Clarity you need to be clear of a goal like you said your clients come to you once they have Clarity okay this is my goal whether it's weight loss whether it's getting my health back one you have Clarity you'll give them the clarity then they need a willpower people think people are born yes some people are born with willpower you they're raised around people with will power but it it is a skill will is a skill that can be developed that is what I teach then you need discipline discipline when I say I somewhere I find motivation overrated I think discipline is a GameChanger when you have discipline discipline is more important than willpower is what you're saying H will they're connected okay initially when you start on a journey you'll need willpower you'll need okay I'm going against my will I need to get up go to the gym you do it often enough today I don't have to think about going to the gym I love it it's a discipline you just get up and you do it do you have to think twice before eating healthy no it's a discipline we this morning I was watching um a beautiful podcast which featured Cristiano Ronaldo and he spoke about discipline he's like you just show up you show up whether you like it you don't like it that question is not crossing your mind you just do it a brand made a beautiful logo out of it just do it just do it yes so I think when we work with our clients and we realize that well you may have an exercise schedule you have an exercise trainer you have a diet plan you have a diet coach uh unless the individual says in the mind this is something I want to do and I if I do this with enough of discipline I'll get my desired goal now shivom when we talk about goals I did not know that she trained Mr amitab G first but you trained him in ki as a role my dad and mom are 77 years of age our parents around that 70 parameter and when we tell them that our celebrities and film stars irrespective of the age especially those who are in the 50s to 60s 60 to 7s I know certain filmm Stars even in the 80s who work out right and they're not going for movies anymore so what is it that one drives them to work out is it that celebrity paycheck that they getting or do you see a different avar it's definitely not the paycheck or anything but I think at this point for Mr bachan for Amit G it is more about health and he recognizes it and he he says it himself he's like I know my body needs it he knows my body he's like I know my body needs to move every single day a little bit even if it's just the 10 minutes of treadmill even if it's just the stretches just the band work no matter what it is like so there are days when like right now when he's shooting for KBC we go to the set he doesn't have an hour to train normally when he has a break and we're training at home then it's a longer time but here we go we do like say 20 minutes just very simple just to get his body to move so are you saying 20 minutes for the general population irrespective of the age they just need that discipline first to start start with just turn up I mean research has proven even if you train for 20 minutes two to three times a week it's enough to see the benefits of weight training and exercise from a health perspective from an aesthetic perspective you might you definitely have to put more work into it but just from everything that happens within the body where exercise is a stimulus for the food to behave in a certain way to behave efficiently the hormones the chemicals the enzymes everything for the blood to ser circulate properly within the system for the circulation to happen 20 minutes of basic weight training basic exercise with little bit of movement is enough to see the benefit I think our most difficult part will be uh getting people to turn up correct and start a process correct everyone says tomorrow and and you own and have run gyms and you know that everyone joins on 1st of January to 15th of January but a sizable amount of population never come back again you just send them to me I'll help him develop the willpower and the discipline and that's where I'm wondering do our children have the least amount of mental training and is that and could that be a place where we need to start a million and 1% if that was ever a percentage because Ryan this morning when I was doing my uh mental coaching program I was I was talking about when I was overweight and somebody U body shamed me I was a kid I was 11 or 12 years old and I I'm grateful to the person who did that because I did it hurt of course it hurt but I did something about it what if he didn't what if I did not even know that something was something was not perfect not proper with me and I could rectify it so today's children today's youngsters I feel they have to psychologically become stronger and whose responsibility is that is it the child's or the parents responsibility to push the child towards mind coaching first is the parents because a lot of parents come to me they said please help my child I said first I need to speak to you so we parents need to lead by example 110% so when I am coaching uh families together I do coaching for families as well I would even I would go as early as before the child is born so when the mother is pregnant I coach them so so they start working on their willpower their discipline their Clarity their patience and by default those traits are getting transferred to the child and then they practice when they are doing their practices the baby is in their lab so you you talk about um discipline was more important and that's something that sh and I need in the exercise and the diet part but talk to us about will power I mean I keep hearing about Willow you know Christ Ronaldo says discipline but these guys have willpower so is there some sort of Mantra I Can chant or some beads I can we or or something yes yes there's a beautiful Mantra You Can chant because you believe in manifestation so the Mantra is you write and you tell yourself you look in the mirror and you tell yourself I have amazing willpower I have have amazing will power and then do one small activity to support that fact one tiny thing so I do the affirmation I have amazing willpower and then what is it that I'm going to be doing yes you have Clarity okay if there you need to do you need to go to the gym okay I would say start with just wearing a shoes that's very easy for his profession I have amazing willpower to H lift this kettle bell for Ryan Fernando it is I have amazing power willpower not to eat this ice cream of it works both ways will power is used to do a particular action or stop you from doing another action and by the end of it Ryan it is not about where you apply it a will a strong will is a strong will whether you apply it in business whether you apply it in uh diet whether you apply it in workout it is still your muscle you can use it it is a skill and there are so many there's a beautiful podcast by Andrew hubman where they are discussing that will and discipline are so deeply connected to your sleeping patterns as well to your diet to your daily routine to your lifestyle I'm glad you brought that up because you know my wife sometimes thinks I'm very crude because you know when somebody says oh that person has anxiety and depression or God forbid somebody committed suicide I'm like the sleep was not good the diet was not good the microbiome was not good and that's why they felt miserable for the last maybe four 5 10 years yes and therefore they are in in that what we call as depression or anxiety mode so have you had cases where minus diet minus exercise the mind is still powerful on its own beautiful question Ryan let give me some time I need to explain what a human system is because otherwise this is the biggest misconception people have that they think that mind is some separate entity and the body is something separate so according to the yogic wisdom we have a physical body which is called the aname Kos we have a subtler body which is called the pran Kos which is your 72,000 naris are there your chakras are there subtler than that is a manomos which is your mental emotional body and then there's vay Kos and the Anand Kos they all are inextricably connected you can't say I will not take care of about the body I will eat all the rubbish in the world rubbish means it is doesn't have any nutritional value and I will not exercise but I can take care of the mind it does not work other way around also I can eat the healthiest of foods I can exercise regularly but I will not take care of the Mind the body will collapse so whatever happens to the mind will happen will affect the body whatever you're doing to the body is going to impact the mind they're not separate it's one entity so it is so important for people to understand the human system as a whole and when they do that that is when they understand the value of like I do mind coaching and we begin with Clarity and then it goes to diet and ex exercise you have to clean up your eating your unay Kos is what is going to make you f uh finish what you started and I teach manifestation and diet and exercise is a part of manifestation training as well how do you have an alert mind in a diseased body it's not possible and there cannot be a healthy mind in a diseased body or the other way around either so seeing it as a whole is where you begin so again one very important uh thing which your listeners can benefit from is we always approach nutrition and exercise from aesthetic point of VI I think it has to become from the health perspective even more so and from manifesting your dreams how do you manifest a dream with a with a completely drained out human system doesn't work those are wise words so I remember meeting the SPG Commandos once and the colonel in charge over there says we develop go go muscles not show muscles I also believe that they developed go thinking not show thinking today's society is quite materialistic and shallow where we can dress ourselves up as being healthy as being powerful as being all present but I think yes we are all animals inside deep down but we got to polish it speaking of animals I know I I I know this this is one question that I had to ask you shaam you trained uh the film stars ranir Kapoor in that role and uh that was an amazing transformation to stand over there and see your shoulders and all the youngsters in India they look at that show Muscle tell us how difficult and how much of sweat maybe tears an effort that has to go on I know definitely there was willpower over there there was discipline but could you just tell us like how intense did it get when you had to prepare or was it a walk in the park no definitely not a walk in the park but uh you know when you guys are speaking about wipai and discipline those are two things which ranir is I think born with it's just conditioned into him his punctuality his discipline his whether we were shooting we're not shooting whether it's early morning it's after shoot it's on the set when he knows something needs to get done and he does it again whether it's 20 minutes 30 minutes not a problem and I used to tell him I said it's okay you know if you don't have an hour to train that's fine let's just train for 30 minutes you know let's remove that much time cuz again exercise and progress and transformation is all like that compounding effect turning up turning up of course you have to turn up you have to turn up for it and the the more you keep doing it the better it keeps getting I mean it's easy to just say you know what uh we only have 30 minutes today so let's just let's just not worry we'll just do tomorrow it's easy and technically in in a day nothing's going to go wrong but being there for the even the 30 minutes it somewhere gives you um a victory a sense of Victory small wins so that is anyways there in his nature and um we started before his the the the movie that we started earlier was to juty mear where he had to be uh player romcom Beach Body Fresh looking like a very youngster kind of thing and we started working out before that so in that movie he was super ripped his abs and everything were like seen and all of that and when we started we were nowhere close to that so somewhere it had to start literally from Basics you know getting him to do the basic lifts the basic movements getting his form correct all of that the body shot was done literally I would say for that movie was done a year into the work so it was one year of work one year of work for that first movie cuz I I believe unless and until it is desperation and there's no choice it can be achieved in a smaller time frame but it's not the healthiest way to approach it cuz if you do then firstly the minute you go back to your normal routine the results are going to rebound I call that occupational side effect AB absolutely and people like you have to ensure that there's a health balancing Factor versus the the looks or the requirement of the road absolutely and we have to we have to understand that even for for all the actors health is very important because one day of not showing up on set is a lot of loss the entire industry for the crew for the producers whoever so we have to keep that in mind and if if that's something that we can control from our side then we try to do it the best so even training wise and everything we did it we did it properly with the good proper nutrition the proper you know like we spoke in the starts knowing at what point of the journey you need to do what kind of training so when we did CrossFit kind of training it was more towards the end when the dness and the definition was required initially it was just about building the muscle building the foundation and then from there we started working for animal and again the body that you see an animal during the fight sequence was again a year after so it's not that we started working and literally 3 months later he was the way he was so that also took time cuz during the entire shoot he's wearing suits he's wearing shirts his body is not shown so it's easy to kind of work behind the scenes and give us enough time because I explained this to him as well I said you know it's better if the more we can delay the body shot and keep it towards the end it will give us more time to kind of work to it properly and he understood that cuz once we reached there it was very easy for him now when he's shooting his current film Rama and I'm not training him for that film but even the way he's looking right now whoever he's training with his body has kind of adapted to that new Baseline it's not gone back to the 71 70 kg toar Kap it some way kind of retain that muscle and that muscle memory which is always a plus Point that's that that's how we need to see ourselves when we are looking at transforming or changing our bodies as well so there are two takeaways from this one I realized that the Transformations what people see in the movie which is a 1 hour one and a half sit down is actually sometimes as long as a year before you see the transformation so there's sweat and tears that go into that the discipline of turning up and showing up and uh the other part is that they're worried about their health also so they're not looking at shortcuts which most of the people out there think that these Transformations I can do it at the cost of my health um and speaking of the movie Animal we get these very ripped bodies with our actors in the male physique that movie had a different theme to it on the animal instincts in all of us but I wanted to take this question to vinda that the male audience whilst we pursuing this amazing physique maybe show Muscle there is a underlining thought on how weak or how powerful the man's mind can be towards family towards women towards Society in general so I've seen this when we have done uh diets for people who are athletes or Transformations there is an aggression uh because of the requirement to build the show muscles so from a mind coach point of view and you both married each other that's why I said you a perfect powerful couple how do you balance that I should I say testost Stone driven Rage which we're seeing in today's world in context of how women are treated in our country and is there something that the men can do to get the brain to a certain level of calmness so this is really important to address especially today Ryan because nothing became this way overnight nothing became this way overnight it has taken years of doing and a lot of it has to be undone so when we speak about an animalistic or very marcher way of uh treating the feminine in a not so respectful manner like this morning when I was doing my manifestation coaching in fact and we were manifesting relationships I was teaching people how to do that I was telling them that when and I have couples together in that as well so you need to may be very clear of what you want in life from your partner and how you wish to be even yourself as a human being so when we are saying everybody says I want to be driven I want to be a hustler I want to be this I said all right all of those are masculine qualities so every human being whether you're a male or a female you have masculine and feminine energies in your body as well so your right channel is called the suryan Nar which is the masculine and the left uh nostril which dominates a idadi which is the feminine which is lunar a balance of these two in fact is very important for the biochemistry of your body to be functioning fine if suryan Nadi is too active there's a lot of aggression you're you're going to have acidity you're going to have anger issues the angrier you are the angrier your energies are the more fiery your energies are you're going to have physical symptoms of the same indigestion is going to be one of them the other way if you're too lunar you you have Moon's energy surging too much you're too too too compassionate or too uh there's everything can be in excess which nature is not in favor of nature thrives in balance and why this is happening also Ryan is also because of what we are observing as kids so one thing when I'm talking to couples I do a lot of couple therapies as well when I say when I'm speaking to them I said first thing you stop is stop belittling your partner whether it's wife doing to the husband or husband doing to the wife stop making jokes on marriages that's a that's a wrong thing to do it's it's not it's something I'm guilty of so I make fun of my wife in front of my kids so that's something I should not be doing yes because it leaves an impression it leaves an impression it leaves an imprint on the child especially if the child is Young so you never ever you whatever you can have arguments but your child is not supposed to be witnessing those and even in your own mind the feminine like I keep telling the men specifically as well the they are energy wates the entire creation is feminine she's energy she's shy so even in our Hindu culture the feminine is deeply respected deeply deeply respected if you want to have prosperity in your life if you want lxmi in your life you respect your mother you respect your wife you respect every female whoever you end up working with so this is a practice that has to be firstly taught to children from a very young age only the masculine qualities are getting glorified you're an achiever you're a go-getter great but are you a nurtural are you compassionate are do you have empathy because they are not validated that much by Society especially when it comes to men they say men should not cry you can cry you can have emotions it's a balance of the two so see me during a emotional movie he cries sometimes even more than me and that's very precious part of him and you will notice this Ryan between a couple you will see a beautiful dance of Shiva Shakti Shiva is the masculine shaki is the feminine emotions that you have so when one is feeling more feminine the other one gets more masculine the one other one stands up no no we can get over this we can do this irrespective of which gender they are from so everything is a play of energies and it is conditioning which is happening over time we are just glorifying the masculine the testosterone estrogen has a beautiful purpose but just um making it very concise that the conditioning the teaching what are we passing on to our children what children are observing in their homes every couple has to have respect between each other talk to each other as if you are your best friends and we act we actually bow down to each other so when we started doing our podcast we recently started doing our podcast we are very late on YouTube but here we are and uh the person who is doing our edits so she was who's handling our YouTube she's like why are you talking to each other like up so be normal how you are in the house I said this is how we speak to each other we speak to each other as up we don't say we've never said to or tum or no we treat each other with a lot of respect and people notice that on the podcast like how beautifully Shivam speaks to you so this is something that has to be learned otherwise the Dynamics of creation goes off and that is not conducive for creation to move forward so please everyone treat your life partners with absolute respect not just your life Partners or just your uh women in your house every woman is worth reverence please have respect and this has to be every human being has to be trained and for me it is like such a no-brainer like why would you not because I was raised that way I also I mean this could be controversial but um I grew up in a house where mother was very powerful she was a leader and uh she used to flick me on the back of my head and say open the door for a lady talk with respect controversial in this sense I believe the mothers of India also need to take a stance and correct their boys and that's what India's mother s are not doing to the Boy Child and hence they get away with behavior that does not give respect to the female so I think I would call out India and mothers out there and I know I'm going to get trolled for this but I I think the mothers also need to catch the boys by the caller before they're 18 always tell them you know it's your God given right to to discipline your children the Fathers as well Fathers as well so when I'm training I train uh couples who carrying a baby so I never say the mother's carrying the baby the couple gets pregnant the couple carries the baby fullterm so when I'm doing practices the practices are not only for the mother the practices are for the husband and the wife and I guess that's why you have that philosophy as both as a couple that we respect each other so it's not about the mother giving birth and it's my baby my body but it's like it's a whole Fusion of you together as a unit and there's no competition there is no male versus female there is no competing who Superior you know that has changed for me in my life about the day my son was born um I remember I called on my dad and I said I've become a dad and my voice had actually broken and he says welcome to fatherhood you are now no longer in competition with your wife and and and and I it it sunk in you know that um uh you can't compete with your spouse you shouldn't be doing that uh and for me that was lifechanging uh that okay it's difficult you know when you lead companies you lead people you want to lead in the marriage also so sometimes when we have conversations these days she like what do you want to do I was like okay whatever do you want to do that's beautiful and and the idea over there was earlier was like no no I have to decide what I want to do but now it's kind of like okay let's where do we go what do you want to do and stuff like that and even in spaces where okay this is something you said about what do you want to do but even in uh major decisions if you're business partners like we are business partners and when you're having a discussion so I always even when I'm doing couples counseling I give this example that doesn't have to be your way or my way there would be a right way irrespective of who's giving that suggestion so having that mindset or having that perspective that you can see a situation in totality and see one point of view see another point of view and both of them can see oh no this makes more sense so let it let's do it this way she's always right so I just like just we're doing exactly what you saying because I've fallen on my face so many times after not listening to her that I said you know what it is there in the astrology chart though I said that I I want to lead a frictionless life which means it's not like there should not be any discomfort I I don't want to force any friction I want to kind of go with the flow I want to be happy and I know that whatever she's saying I I tell her I said I know you're right five minutes let me argue with you for the sake of just that ego that the feeling good because I know that whatever you're saying we're going to do that only but five minutes just to satisfy my own little male little ego little L aete inside of you let me just let me just argue for five minutes you just for the just for the heck of it because she literally has intuition and she literally has um a vision that can see 10 steps ahead and when you've seen that and it's been proven then why are you going to fight against it just go with it no it's it's as simple as that so when you know that someone is right it's it's easier to leave your ego behind and just kind of let it happen cuz she's anyways going to make it right so just sit back enjoy I think most of us men do that you know it's like the other day she's like uh okay um where do you want to go for a holiday it's like wherever you want to go for the holidays like how can you not decide where you want to go for theid I was like you know first you kind of populate the list of where you want to go and I'm like like yeah we we'll figure that out where we're going to go but this frictionless process uh is also I think Shivam part of evolvement of every individual so we evolve in our mind we evolve in our bodies we evolve in age your journey um from athlete to fitness trainer to now lead leading people and guiding them has your time in the gym begun to change both personally and do you now begin to subscribe that to people that you coach also do you see where they are in their life I I think 100% my time in the gym has has changed a lot I mean from right now literally it's because with everything else going on I know that I have those two hours only to train so when I enter the gym it's literally those two hours they're my time time and in that time I don't want to answer any calls I don't want to speak to anybody so I literally in my gym come across as the most arrogant and most strict and Caro person in the gym is it because you're on your own space yeah so I like to put that I'm I'm not putting it out purposely but it's like when you're focusing on something even though you're staring at something you're not staring at it so it's like there there's no expression it's blank so people kind of you know think that oh it's arrogance but it's it's absolutely fine but then of course two three people came and spoke to me or they asked me something about Fitness and they say you're actually not as Karo as you look you're actually quite sweet I said yeah because I'm in my space so I like to I don't wear headphones I don't wear a t-shirt that says buzz off I think my energy is enough to tell people lak re M but it's fine and I try to tell people when I people who I know and in the gym I've complained also okay what the hell's going on this is a gym not I mean why are you talking so loudly talk but don't let other and people know me as that complaint box whatever and it's fine but people who I know I tell them I said you work so hard you spend so much time and effort in training why are you I mean you can do the same conversation outside outside in a different time why are you wasting your time because now you're saying you've got to go pick up your son from school or you got to go buy some groceries or you got to do some other work so this time is a very limited amount of time that you have in the gym which you actually love and you look forward to then you're contradicting It Yourself by coming and okay meet and greet is fine but stop it at that no I want to throw a little bit of controversy into this so far right now because she said she was a fitness trainer too and I see women in the gym having the most amazing workouts because they're talking and talking and talking and talking so what's your take on on his thought he's the one who changed my uh perspective yeah so for me um whatever you do in life you have to Horn into you have to literally focus into it whether it's training whether it's eating whether it's drinking it it deserves all of your attention because it is going to become your life force so this happened in fact in the gym and this really noisy gym web where I'm sorry to say but it's not just limited to women men and women my God you talk across uh workstations they can talk across cardio equipments and I'm in the middle and I'm like excuse me can you please get up from here and I'll shift I'll go to that side you can chat I don't know how you're breathing while you're exercising and you're talking I don't know how that works so understand and I said this to uh he said this to somebody he said you need to have some discipline in the gym and they got very offended they said what do you mean discipline this not a school and I my jaw dropped I like we never understood what discipline was discipline was not only for studying it was supposed to be carried forward to see anything to fruition to do justice to anything in life you need to have discipline and discipline is very boring it's not very interesting it is not like when exerting will when the fitness journey is starting and you're exerting will and people are complimenting you and it's novelty I think that's why we need a fitness coach or we need a mind coach and specifically as a mind coach because like Fitness coach is becoming a trend now right I have a personal trainer I have a yoga instructor and people are realizing that uh it does work but from a mind coach point of view when somebody says uh this is not school and we don't need to be disciplined I think and that's what I communicate to everyone about diet the last time you were held accountable was by your school teacher and principal so true so true and that's why I tell people I love these Health checkups which have a b c d in it because then when you have bone health at D and you have cholesterol at C then you're kind of getting a disciplined card saying that you need to do something about your life but do you know how sad it is that you cannot hold yourself accountable and your entire life somebody else has to come and like push you in that direction it's fine till a certain uh stage in your life but when you're are an adult you need to develop a mindset which says if this is good for me I've decided something is good for me whether it's working out whether it's eating healthy whether it's sleeping on time following circadian rhythms it's important for me it's good for me I am going to do it you don't see in terms of easy or hard so in terms of easy or hard is there any quick tips that you can give the viewers just to get more healthier because I would say I need you to have an amla in the morning Shivam will say do four sets of this exercise and follow it up with XY Z stretching I'm just trying to grasp like what do you tell the mind oh thank you for asking this question because when you speak about the mind I'm mentioning mind multiple times but where is the mind and there's a very very beautiful line by the senior cardiologist Dr BM hegre and he says where is the mind never mind so we only know we only aware of the brain brain yes mind is all over the body every cell of your body is perceiving something so that is what science is also trying to uh come to is mind is kind of like a wag concept and it is non-local that's what the yogic system also believes and the only way to grasp the mind or to bring about changes in the mind is through the breath so in the yogic scriptures there's a beautiful uh verse which says as the breath moves the mind will move so the step one the most fundamental thing that your viewers can do is learn how to breathe right EV a lot of people I won't say everybody because a lot of them would be breathing right but most of the people are very shallow breathers and they can be mouth breathers and the biggest reason for the elevated levels of of Stress and Anxiety is also because we don't know how to decompress what's decompress decompress literally means this carbon dioxide building up in your system and you're not even exhaling properly so what else is going to happen build up of stress your body will exper part of it is carbon dioxide let go of the carbon dioxide so when you are just get little mindful about the bra way that you breathe you keep your spine upright inhale always through the the nose consciously involve the diaphragm it's a beautiful muscle its function is in respiration involving the diaphragm what does it look like the abdomen will come out slightly and as you exhale the abdomen will go in exhale longer than the inhalation if you're trying to de-stress so when you deliberately exhale say for 6 seconds you're inhaling to three from the nose exhale from the mouth or the nose for 6 seconds you will see your parasympathetic nervous system kicking in you'll get calmer you'll feel more relaxed that's why people sigh yes it this is called a physiological sigh as well in which there is a double inhale and a exhale the science of breath is phenomenal the science of pranayams is phenomenal we are just talking about basic breath we've not even gone to the pranayams the system of pranayams so the entire yoga sutras if you say yog which is by Mahari patanjali it is all about managing the mind so I'm taking a cut over here from the mind in terms of you're saying there's the there's the mind and then you're saying there's the breath yeah so the breath if controlled is what keeps the mind in equilibrium and in control yes so in today's day and age when we don't have discipline or willpower one of the starting points could be breath erratic or Haywire am am I hearing you correct for sure because you can't have a strong willpower if you had a poor night's sleep mhm correct this is because if there is the pran is not moving fine in the body in the beginning I mentioned the subtle body of pran she the circulation why do we need to exercise even physically the bran gets circulated in the athletes rinda the exact same point they don't sleep well the previous night the resting heart rate next morning is high and the body actually requires more sugar to pump the heart faster which leads to more Cravings of the next day which means your diet goes for a toss exactly so and people say oh everything that sleep is an industry today like to get sleep see you will you again you are compartmentalizing the human being the sleep is not a thing by itself it is a culmination of what you did for the 24 hours so you can't be stressed throughout the day consuming content which is stressful not knowing how to breathe and you expect to fall asleep just the moment you switch off your lights that is not how it works your circadian clock has to be set in motion you can't be sleeping till 10:00 in the morning and expect to fall asleep at 10 p.m. it will not happen speaking of sleep Shivam um we know that muscles are also built in the bedroom in terms of sleep the celebrities I've had many celebrity schedules and sometimes they shoot the whole night if you were to give the youngsters of this country and I'm talking talking about the 15 year olds to the 35 year olds advice and they're not going for a film shoot at night but they're distracted by say Netflix or TV or they think that they can get by with four or five hours of sleep what is your take on training and sleep see I think everything needs to change uh the whole definition of Fitness has changed for me as well now when I ask when I do webinars and I ask people I said what is your goal when it comes to Fitness and people reply all sorts of different things I think from my perspective it is to grow old in a healthy way repeat that again grow old in a healthy way so when I say that what do I mean when I'm okay right now right now everything is in our favor we're strong we're able to recover from our injuries better we don't need that many medicines we don't need to go see the doctor the physio all of that we can lift heavy all of that is great but today I'm 40 tomorrow 75 80 I don't want to be Dependable upon anything or anyone and for that that reward or that result will only be reached if I start working on it today so the sooner you begin it's it's not that if you you can't start training at 65 or 70 you can but the benefits that you will see if you start changing your lifestyle sooner is better no so when people are saying okay I'm only 15 I'm only 16 I mean come on we all have been there I mean till 13 14 years back I was parting four nights in a in a week and drinking and smoking and doing all of that but I was still exercising but again the body kind of supported that probably today the way children are or today the way the youth is it probably won't support anymore things have changed nutrition has changed a lot so somewhere we need to compensate all those actions as well so looking after uh you know managing stress doing certain breath work definitely focusing on exercise focusing on the right supplementation which we can probably of course supplements people think are bad but now when we have to compromise for the lack of nutrients from foods and supplements are absolutely okay so we have to do all that because once again youngsters need to understand they are literally investing today in themselves for a future tomorrow no one is saying go to the gym for 2 hours 3 hours get on a ketogenic diet and all of that but somewhere okay go party go drink your your kids I mean you are going to do it even if I tell you or your parents tell you not to do it you will do it and I've have done it so I'm nobody to tell you not to do it but at least balance it out somewhere that's the problem that balance is not happening anywhere even if they're not parting the sleeping late even if they're parting the eating wrong they're not training there definitely there's no uh Stress Management so there's nothing which is going in their favor besides the Natural Evolution of energy within their body which is helping them to get up every single morning do what needs to be done and continue but how long will that natural help that assistance be there how long at some point we will have to take over and do something ourselves otherwise it's all going to go downhill so as I said earlier most powerful couple I've ever met why because you're combining the mind and the body so when somebody coaches with both of you what's the takeaway or where are you approaching it from what's the power to make somebody more powerful is it that okay I let me do muscle for one year then I come and do mind for the next year or why the combination to start first off because like I mentioned earlier every human being needs to understand themselves in totality just your physical body is not who you are you have a mental emotional body and they affect each other so if I ask you if you have excessive cortisol in the body do you lose fat very easily you don't so some way your state of mind is even is connected to your physical fitness goals and not just that Ryan because I know you believe in law of attraction and manifestation and that is what I teach when you're trying to manifest something whether it's a a Fit Body whether it is a successful career happy relationship good health whatever it is you need a vibrant human system I'm not saying you need just muscles you need the human system to be vibrant you mentioned the vibrational frequencies so your system should be powerful and it has to have a certain positive frequency you can't be stressed from morning till night always focusing on lack what is not going right and expect to meet any goal whether it's physical fitness or otherwise it will not happen to the most in the most efficient manner it will not happen so just get clear people need to get clear of who they are in totality what are the uh Powers available to them what are the provisions given to them and all of them can be used to ACH attain whichever goal you decide to achieve whatever it is physical fitness so when we are taking on a client it has to be body and mind otherwise we are not doing Justice to the client you need to educate the client as well and everybody even shivom will say the same whenever he is having the first meeting with the client everybody is complaining of stress excessive stress whether it's corporates whether it is celebrities not just limited to them when we are coaching younger kids a 10 year-olds are experiencing stress excessive amounts of stress so not knowing how to handle your mind Ryan think about this we spoke about willpower discipline nobody's taught us actually how to develop those they just by default in the education system we pick it up nobody taught us how to focus how many times you heard as a kid focus on this focus on this has anybody ever taught us how to focus the mind okay focus okay still it is glorified everybody knows okay you need to focus to get to your goals has anybody told you the importance of defocusing if you're too focused can you fall asleep at night of course not so understand the mind it it how to use it where to use it how to switch it off how to not use it and go to sleep so all of these trainings have to be given to every individual irrespective of what age they are and that is why I think it's also called Mind muscle connection I was about to ask you about the Mind muscle connection that when you're working out uh do you need to be there in presence for that workout it makes sense no otherwise you just I keep telling people otherwise you're just moving the weight from point A to point B but there's nothing really happening in there it's just a mechanical action but what you're trying to do is you're trying to engage the muscles by that particular movement and that is why I say one breath one rep one breath one rep think about it when you're doing training for hypertrophy not functional training when you're training for hypertrophy every time you exert Force you breathe out what is hypertrophy is basically muscle growth okay so whenever you're doing weight training whether it's for fat loss whether hypotrophy but when are you doing weight training basically I'm want to bulk up my muscle yeah if if you're bulking up for the purpose of fat loss also that's fine but whenever you're using movements like bench press biceps squats deadlifts and you're doing isolation strength movements not functional movements which are out of control when it comes to heart rate and breath I always say one breath one RP so think every time you exert Force what that allows you to do is firstly it slows down the movement you get enough oxygen in your system to power through secondly because it's slowing it down you're able to connect that muscle much better you're able to engage every single muscle fiber whether it's your fast Twi it your slow Twi it you're able to feel it and that is what mind muscle connection is so when I tell people every time in your workouts do some sets where you're using only isolateral movement so one side of the body keep the other hand on that muscle of course when you're doing the back you can't but say if you're doing bicep if you're doing chest if you're doing cable flies feel the muscle feel it pump feel it engage CU then now your mind is now connected to how that muscle is moving and feeling now every single set after that when you do every single rep you will try to mimic the exact same feeling in the chest or the bicep or the tricep it really helps so when I do leg extensions or whatever I like to keep my hand on the leg and feel the muscles whether it's a bicep it it just helps even today even after 20 years of weight training it still feels good to know that hey it's it's there it's working but it feels good because you can feel the muscle it's not that you're doing biceps and you're feeling it in the shoulder oh my shoulder is hurting but you just did bicep why is your shoulder hurting I don't know I was doing this movement so then Focus now keep your coring gate stand still get your mind in the movement otherwise what are you training for why are you in the gym I don't understand it's probably because I love exercise so much that I get really emotional and passionate about it that it hurts when I see people doing things wrong I tell people in the gy you should be fined for doing wrong movements what the hell are you doing what is that no that's functional my trainer's given me I know who the trainer they we all friends that is not what what is that movement how is that helping and and is this the reason that we should always find Qualified trainers to trainers and the trainer should be mentally and physically present to guide people who don't know how to work out look you're an elite athlete you're an Elight coach you know how to work out but for the rest of us are uninitiated I still sometimes don't do a bicep call properly after 20 years but I tell you sometimes it's not the fault of the coach it's not the fault of the trainer and I've seen this trainers giving the right exercise and the right program to the client the client says kg my part sir but you've been doing 5 kgs for the last one year don't you want to see Improvement to even the trainers like so some it's not always the fault of the trainer because see somewhere the trainers are also they're like if I don't do it he's going to go to somebody else so India has this thought I don't need to go to the gym Shivam has big muscles right so everyone's thinking yoga Pilatus walking all of the general exercises tell us how important is muscle towards anti-aging and the reduction of heart attack and reduction of blood pressure resech research has actually proven that India is the lowest today when it comes to people with quality functional muscle in the rest of the world amongst the whole world India is the lowest and if you go to see it's not actually that hard yes you're absolutely right the mind is the superpower but the biggest organ today is the muscle it's where everything is happening inside the muscle when when they say muscle is metabolically active what it means is that unless and until you don't feed it with the right nutrition and you don't engage it with exercise you are going to lose it for a person who doesn't exercise after the age of 35 till the time they they die they are losing a certain percentage of muscle every single year and what we also people don't realize is that muscles have a certain amount of triglycerides within them for energy sake but people who you'll see lot of people in the gym who can't even squat like they struggle it is not because that they don't have the strength the muscles have become dysfunctional the fat has overtaken in it's I heard it in another episode it's like you're literally packing your suitcase with clothes where to a point now the clothes are kind of overflowing from the suitcase so the whole point is open the suitcase start removing all the excess fat from it by training and weight training is the best way to do it and start getting the functionality of the muscle back why muscle is what looks after your blood pressure muscle is what basically controls your insulin sensitivity muscle is what controls your blood glucose levels controls your heart rate controls your joint health the majority of the deaths that happen in senior citizens is because of falling either they die because of that or they die either because they're in the hospital recovering from that and they end up getting something else and simple reason muscle has slow twitch fast twitch fibers slow twitch fibers are the ones responsible for strength fast ttch are the ones responsible for explosive sudden movements what happens when you fall or when you slip the minute you slip your legs move to kind of balance you out that is your fast twitch fibers and what helps you break that fall is your slow twitch fibers you don't have to train separately for it you just have to train so that tomorrow when you fall you will slip or you'll lunge but you won't slip and break your hand or wrist or it actually happened to me two three months back and I was going from the gym I was crossing the pool side and going down and I slipped but I fell into a beautiful Lune and I had my suitcase on me the next day I came a suitcase my gym literally like a suitcase the next day I came to the gym and one of the gym instructors she told me she like it's actually a true thing I'm not making this up but this is what I mean I'm not training differently to protect my muscles or protect my joints and that is why muscle needs to be given that much more importance today because again I don't you can actually help me on this point and maybe correct me on this point people think fruits are the healthiest food items in the world they can eat all the fruits they want and they'll be fine but fruit is still sugar am I right you're right yes if but you need to have fruit not from the energy point of view but from the antioxidants the nutritive perspective so if they're having a bowl of fruit first thing in the morning and this person is a non-training individual what is happening to that food oh it's going sugar and liver and fat now who will explain this when I whenever we travel it's nice that you are saying it when no because it's it's I like I said I I always say one thing whenever I'm giving it any talk or webinars I could be wrong so if I am please do correct me at any point cuz I could be wrong but whenever we travel and we go to hotels and we see people Stack Up on fruits first thing in the morning and you can tell that person doesn't go to the gym even if okay even if they did proper working like say for my example myself and that day I've just have not gone to the gym I can still afford to eat some fruit I think it comes from this concept India is a health loving Nation not a health doing Nation so here's the thought process exercise so it's going to be difficult to do that and I think from that perspective is where people come with this whole concept what I tell people or what you can encourage people in your gym is there one line that I keep using for everybody out there which is muscle is the only age reversible organ in the human body absolutely how beautifully you put it so at any time I mean the brain doesn't age so the mind doesn't age technically but the muscle requires work correct and that work requires you to put some resistance to that muscle so stretching only doesn't work walking only doesn't work there needs to be that resistance which what I have read needs to be more than what your muscle is normally given Progressive overload what we call so I was hearing a very good podcast on anti-aging and he said very something very uh logical and something very amazing stress needs to be put in the B so when we do cold showers when we do sauna when we do all of that the whole idea behind that and anti-aging is that somewhere you are putting your body through adversity you're causing through a challenge you're causing a little a small amount of stress which then triggers the body to release its uh immune system its anti aging system which automatically work as an anti-aging it self-defense mechanism and that's what it is the reason why you put yourself in cold showers and all of that in in situations which are not comfortable which are not normal and throwing your body out of homeostasis or balance is so that your body thinks that there's something which is unnatural happening so I need to protect myself because the first priority of the body is always going to be survival and like you said as long as you put a little bit stressed today for one week you've done 5 kgs next week try to do 7.5 maybe reduce the Reps a little bit that is what is called Progressive overload then go back to 7.5 and complete the number of reps you did the first week every single week you are tweaking the stress a little bit a little bit not too much because that too much can be detrimental just enough so that your body has to adapt to that stress and that adaptation is what causes progress I think over here I want to bring Renda in because whenever I go to the gym right or I do the cold showers by the way for the cold showers uh just the point for for you you're absolutely right on the cold showers 6 hours later it releases something known as brain derived neurotropic Factor yes which actually goes and socks your brain into saying I love the workout amazing so cold showers are amazing absolutely but most people my clients when they come rinda they complain time I don't want to do this I don't want to do that I don't want to do this this is so difficult uh there is there's no driver today so how do we Prime the mind to understand that what Shivam is saying is that you need to build resistance you need to increase Progressive load before all of that everyone standing outside the gym looking inside uh this is very difficult to do I don't think I can do this and then they give up there so how do we go get there for them from this to saying ke okay here's my gym bank here my gym gloves here's my shoes let's get started and not run away so it starts Ryan with identifying what is important for you the thing that people are really struggling with is Clarity should we write down our goals yes yes I was just going to say that to get clarity please take a piece of paper and write down what do you want supposing you are uh 70 years of age or imagine yourself when you're 70 and you want to look back at life how do you wish to have led it so write it down okay I'm successful I have good health when you're saying good health then you will have to put in the work so it is a mindset that you need to develop which starts with Clarity it will then you will do the practices to develop the will and there's a beautiful line which says if you think you can and if you think you can't you're right you stand outside and say I can't do this you can't do this you peeping out and saying I can do this I can do this so understanding this is your power and there's no judgment you don't want to do it don't say you can't you don't want to do it I can understand then you can't blame anyone take responsibility of your life you cannot live your life saying I don't have the good coach I don't have the perfect diet we can't go to the gym Shivam is coming to the house also so everything is online now for us in fact so everything is available to you so time has come to stop making excuses if you're making excuses then stop complaining then don't complain so I teach people to take responsibility of their life this one human being should not become a problem and somebody else is not your problem I always tell my wife you're not my life partner I my body is my life partner and you I am married to where we go on this journey together where my body which is my life partner and your body life partner they become gym Partners your also connected the reason why we want to be healthy is so that we don't end up being a burden on other people and we can actually look after people we love if tomorrow you are unhealthy yourself and you are always falling sick and you can't do things and you've got aches and pains and tomorrow if you have to look after your children or look after your parents or whoever how are you going to do it in this matter you have to be selfish you have to come first so that you can then look after people you love this is very important especially for women Ryan because and when women have a newly born baby or even in how they are they're nurturers they love nurturing they love taking care of their family whether it's a young child or their husbands or whoever is there in-laws parents and I need need to actually train them to prioritize themselves yes themselves I and this is the reasoning I give if you are not fine how will you take care of all the people that you think you have the responsibility of how will you do that so this is a very interesting uh example I wanted to give you I was training one of the corporate uh female who was in a very Superior position in a corporate and she had a board meeting a very stressful day so we were doing a session in the car so on the way back we were doing a video session in the car and she's like rinda I'm so stressed and she had a young baby she said R I'm so stressed I just want to go and hug my child and uh that everything becomes fine when I hug my baby I said you stop your car right now he says you will never ever hug your child when you're depleted why would you PCH energy off your baby you're supposed to be giving the energy I said you stop you Rectify your energy right now so she literally parked her car I mean the driver was there so they parked we did some breath work we did some visualization she became fine breath always works Ryan because that's the way you change the mind how are we when we angry and agitated and anxious we breathe a certain way it's shallow shut and fast you lengthen the breath use the diaphragm the parasympathetic system rest and digest system has to kick in within 7 to 10 minutes she was fine I said now you're ready to go home fully energized not fully not it's the end of the day but not depleted go home now you hug your baby understand the change begins with you if you want any change in your life it starts with Mahatma Gandhi said it beautiful saying right outside the office as well you become the change that you wish to see you want your family life to be peaceful you become peaceful you want success in your life you become success as a life first do everything right but it begins with you you can't neglect your own physical mental emotional well-being and expect to see that in your relatives it's not going to happen it begins with you the change begins with you and prioritize I do this for newly for mothers who have newborn babies do you know how hard it is for them to take out time for themselves I said but if you don't do this everything else gets jeopardized even your uh I think even your milk secretion gets jeopardized with your stress levels so all of that has to be taken into account your relation people's when there are young mothers their relationship with their husbands starts suffering because the mothers are not emotionally they still finding their footing in this new space so postpartum is a real thing but how every single female experiences uh postpartum is totally up to the practices that they do for themselves which are extremely extremely important so yes your question was that you think you can't be as peeping from outside no time has come to not make excuses if you want a change in your life please make the changes if you're not making the changes then please accept your destiny nobody's judging you you want to cry sit in one corner and cry and do the blame game your prerogative but don't expect your life to change if you don't change I had I had a client who uh joined my program and she's like I can't do the whole workout but I want to train what do I do I said let's do something very simple for the next 2 weeks let's just do the warm-up let's just do the 10 minutes of warm-up nothing else you won't do anything else after that let's add the next part to it after 2 weeks one month went past she messaged me said all right so I've every single day I woke up and I did the warm-up and I did after two weeks I added the other part I said okay now let's add the third part so we usually in my online programs there's a warm-up activation there's a small weighted workout functional workout and a course so I said okay now let's just add the weighted workout we won't add functional right now after 2 months she started doing the entire thing after three or four months she messaged me say Sir workouts are going great I've been consistent I can do the whole workout intensity is increasing I've lost all the weight so how did it start it all started with just the warmup your willingness to do the fact yes you can't take away that aspect from her that she wanted to make a change yes at that point and this is probably 99% of the people who want to but their physical bodies are in a state where they cannot do the entire thing start slow I say initially as a beginner you'll be surprised but just learning the skill of lifting a weight with an empty bar will give you the results because more than the muscles at that point it's more of your neurological system which causes the progressive overload which causes the adaptation you see all these new people come and you know their hands are shaking while they're doing dumbles and they can't even get themselves that's a very normal thing so imagine just getting that right first that itself can get my feet fixed in position embrace my core get the hands tight move the weight even if it's 2 kgs without anything that itself will cause change you don't have to jump into the deep end sometimes you can start with the most basic basic movement but you do have to dip your feet in the water so I used to teach when I was in Australia I used to teach kids how to swim infants all the way up to Squad which is like 18 years and the infants how they how we used to introduce them to water was the parents would bring them the father would stand in the water the he'd hold the child and we'd have this chani this the bucket with the holes and just get the kid used to the water then after that once the kid is used to you also then after some time the father moves away and then you kind of hold the kid and make him swim around and this and that and slowly slowly step by step you kind of move him along the railing and then he swims but it starts slow and I think as a coach that uh confidence is something that you need to give your client it's possible the other day I put up a video of a muscle up saying that the muscle up is not a measure of Fitness because 99% of the people are not even looking at doing a muscle up it is a beautiful movement it gets you in your all upper body muscles and everything it's great but don't get infatuated with this movement because there are a lot of people who see these videos today on social media and they get intimidated they see someone doing muscle ups and 300 kg deadlifts and everything and they feel like this is not my scene so that is when the coach needs to come in and say you don't have to you don't have to do that we're going to the other end of the gym and we're just going to do something really simple so as a client you literally need to handle the client as an infant as a newborn child when they enter the gym to give them that confidence to give them that sense of Safety and Security once they get comfortable then they can play with the big boys then but it's not even going to the gym anymore even if at home training at home you can develop muscles training at home but the ideas to start with the most ideas will start with the most simplest thing and then move up there's one thing that we didn't discuss today uh maybe a little bit we talk about the science we talked about the mind we talked about the muscle the muscle science the Mind science the biggest excuse that people have is I don't have time shivom what's your take rinda you go next on if you can justify it being a priority so i' I've heard it in a lot of videos If you you can justify 30 minutes of exercise being more important than 30 minutes of Netflix or a documentary or something that you want to watch you've won the thing youve won the battle it's just that you need to replace something with that 30 minutes of exercise and for that you need to justify that 30 minutes of exercise being a priority in why it is important and somewhere that has to be attached rather than to the weighing scale or to a six pack it has to be attached to something a little bit more emotional how are you going to feel when you actually get that goal what is that going to make you feel how is it going to change your life how is it going to change your perspective or other people's perspective towards you I think if people can get that emotional aspect rather than the tangible goal and everybody everybody knows exercise is important today everybody knows everybody knows eating is important so they know it they just need to justify it being a priority brinda I have no time is the is the biggest excuse um I always say yes time is a finite commodity it's the same for you me or anybody else in the world but if You observe any successful person we've trained a lot of those successful people we you can't even imagine how busy their days are we have trained people who have even worked out at 3:00 a.m. and then sat for makeup and then or had 16 hour long days and then made time for a 30- minute workout and breath work and pranayams so again it comes like it is not even like sh mention validation how it'll make you feel that's great to begin with but eventually you will have to do it for you you have to identify this is good for me this is going this is something that I want it and I'm going to apply my energies for doing it and the crazy part is Ryan once you have identified this is important important for me whether if somebody validates me or no irrespective I validate my own actions when you do that time will be get time will actually get made for you it actually gets created for you if Mr butan can find time to train between two episodes of KBC anybody else nobody else has an excuse I've learned so much from him knowing what is important for you and then just do it the will the discipline the time management and once you decided this is important for me I'm going to do it time will get made for you this is the beauty of manifestation again so let's move into um a quicker mode uh a rapid fire Shivam this is for you does lifting weights make women bulky not at all makes them strong I want to ask you rinda that same question because you are a train and a mind coach no it does not cuz I've been training with weights my entire life um I think all the weight loss and the weight gain all nutrition is a very big part of it and women don't have that level of testosterone that you're going to get really bulky but yes they can feel little bulky because suddenly they feel they arms are looking slightly bigger they just have to wait for the fat to disappear and they'll see the beautiful Cuts wait for the fat to disappear weight training is highly recommended for women is cardio necessary every day for weight loss in a gym not every day because at the end of the day it is how you expend that amount of energy so whether you're doing it through cardio you're doing it through weights you're doing it through functional training or just your activity throughout the day doesn't really matter is strength training more effective than cardio for fat loss absolutely how so strength training you're again working on building muscle we all know that the more muscle you have because it is metabolically active it needs more energy to survive automatically you are raising your BMR now it's not that you're raising it through 1,000 calories or 10,000 calories which you're raising it minimally but that minimal increase in the BMR will assist you in burning more calories when you're sitting and doing absolutely nothing than you would when you are you know on the treadmill and you can use strength trining movements in a cardio does a plant-based diet provide enough of protein for muscle building when we talk about protein we talk about amino acids we all know that okay fair enough plant-base is not a complete protein but when thankfully being in an Indian culture when you do mix up all the ingredients together your Dal your subies your grains and everything thei rice you do end up making most of the amino acids depending on your goal you might require a little bit more you can always go for a plant-based supplement but it's not necessary that you need to have uh meat or other forms of animal products this is a trending question right now is it better to work out in the morning or better to work out at night um ideally it is good to work out in the morning because you're in sync with nature but there are a lot of people whose jobs and lifestyle would not allow that and for them working out in the evening or in the night is fine as long as they do other things to compensate for working out in the night because we know that in the night your body is going to sleep your body needs to rest engaging your nervous system is not the best thing to do so do certain kind of breath Works to again you know release that cortisol from your system and you're fine is it necessary to take supplements for a workout it's not necessary but it completely depends on your goal if you are a bodybuilder if you are an athlete if you're looking for performance then food is not going to do it all then of course you will have to compensate it with uh supplements like creatine glutamine it can be other supplements uh as well protein shakes but it's there's nothing wrong in it all depends on your goal can creatin improve your workout performance absolutely it is the most researched uh supplement on the planet and the most proven supplement on the planet but once again we saw a very interesting video which said that uh they did a they did a uh controlled experiment between two groups who they gave creating one and they did not give to the other one but they didn't tell the other one they were not giving them they told them as well that we're giving you so somewhere the power of belief the fact that they were getting the creatine actually showed the same results then actually more results than the group that was getting the creative it was somewhere uh on a higher side this reminds me of the milkshake study milkshake study where people thought that they were getting an unhealthy milkshake but they got a healthy milkshake and the inflammatory markers were actually normal when the people got the bad milkshake so that is the power of mind so is caffeine the most effective pre-workout supplement for some people yes because I mean it has its natural uh it does its it does what it does in the body by increasing adrenaline increasing your uh you know Drive kind of U chemicals your hormones so somewhere it does make you a little bit edgy and but like for me it doesn't work for me pre pre-workout supplements don't work I usually tell people go to the gym start your warmup and I promise you within the next 5 minutes you'll be all geared up to go I've seen that myself personally I hit the gym around 4:30 in the evening I'm all like mentally exhausted and everything and it just get in the first 10 minutes and then the brain just wakes up absolutely and I one more amazing hack for that is there are days when you don't really feel like training choose any three or four exercises that you love what are those uh so personally I love doing back and shoulders so uh I will choose maybe two back exercises like a seated row um you know like a reverse fly and for shoulders I'll probably do side raises on the cable something very light but engaging and I'm not kidding within the next 5 minutes or two sets into that I'm ready for the full-on workout if India got a chance to work out with you today but they said we can only do three workouts this week and only one hour each day correct how would you construct that workout very simple first day we' do a push split second day we would do a pull split and third day we' do a lower body spit split that'd be a little bit of weight training that'd be a little bit of functional and a little bit of core in all of them is there a place I can find this workout yes online you can definitely find it so we're going to be putting the link to get shm's workout and you can check the descriptor below and click there to get this 3-day workout get started India few more questions and these are for vinda can journaling or writing down improve your mental well-being absolutely because understand whatever you're thinking it is energy so it has to leave your body it has to come out but I take journaling in a little different way uh when you're writing something negative you had a negative experience it has to come out but I suggest don't keep it with you so I have a very interesting technique which I call WTF mhm so it's not what you're thinking it is right tear and flush what right tear yes so whenever so I use this technique for U helping people let go of the past some painful experience whether it happened yesterday or two days ago you write it but don't leave it there it's energy tear it and flush it but get it out of your system so writing really helps don't forget to use toilet paper when writing that or you shred it in tiny tiny tiny bits and it gets flushed as well is therapy necessary for everyone I would say only only to the level that you don't understand yourself you just need a therapist therap for the lack of a better word I would say a coach just like you need a fitness coach you need a coach to help you understand your mental emotional body so for that you will definitely need help because that is that is the territory which youve not explored before in even kindergarten you need a coach you need a teacher so when you're talking about something as deep as the mind you feel you don't need a coach everybody needs a coach and then learn the techniques and then take the journey on from there I think ancient indias always had coaches they were called gurus yes in everything because we had gurukuls we had gurukuls so children would taught not just a way of earning a living in schools they would taught life skills which is my intention so this is what the I'm working a lot with the youth and uh it's my mission so 5 million people in the next 5 years I've already said it out loud so universe is going to make it happen so going to empower them so if somebody wants to empower themselves and do mind coaching with you how do we reach out to you they're online so yes please you put the description getting the description link for you for mind coaching with brinda an important question which I see a lot of children under stress or even adults under stress including in my own team we do so much of diet counseling calling up clients and I think people stop short of a panic attack right so can can breathing exercises help manage going in that direction to get a panic attack or prevent a panic attack 100% Ryan but don't wait for the panic attack to happen and panic attack does not happen suddenly there is a buildup to it so I make people more aware of when their energies are getting more stressed out and when anxiety is just starting out so at that part itself you apply the practices and the breath work and there are certain I call it 321 flip technique where you learn how to flip a thought 3 2 1 flip technique and which Mahari patanjali actually called it praka bavana can you imagine thousands of years ago they have spoken about the mind in such detail and gave the importance that this has to be done it has to be done otherwise a panic attack is just waiting to happen so you apply the flip technique and you do the breath work and yes in all probability the panic attack is not going to get full-blown out of control Shivam if not a fitness trainer in another life what would you be I've never thought of that I mean in this life I wanted to be a lot of things but wow a question that nobody asked me honestly I'd probably be I would love to be just meditating somewhere in the mountains rinda oh that this life or next life if you had a chance to go back in a time capsule what would you want to do meditating on my Shiva with my Shiva as well so yeah I'm so glad that we align on this answer and we never actually thought about this before this no I keep saying I said if in the next life I'm able to come back then at least uh I pray to God that bring me into a environment which is conducive to take God's name from even earlier even ear that is something I always ask for not just his name just sadas so I think the mind and spirituality both connect and I think the modern day world is disconnected yeah from bringing those two together it's been great me you today three are together body mind and the spirit yeah the body is something that all three of us have to work on with everyone but I think the spirit is also something that comes in from the universe absolutely it is the universe and we are the tiny aspect of that Universe May the force be with you and with that May the force be with both of you India's most powerful couple that I have met for the first time thank you it's been a pleasure to host both of you and any final words of wisdom to India there's no replacement for hard work so just uh get your mind in order and it will just everything else will just happen it will flow grinda literally just take charge of your mind space and just get up and do it mentally genuinely physically this has been an amazing podcast one of the few podcasts which my media team and I were shocked to find out that we actually did the Law of Attraction the power of the mind and actually manifested it and 20 minutes later we were both communicating with each other so this has been one of those heartwarming very special close to the soul very spiritual and I hope you can take away a few takeaways that will help get you to the next level start small as sham said turn up keep your mind calm breathe well as vinda said and from my desk your body is the most expensive real estate you'll ever own in this lifetime take good care of it thank you for watching this
