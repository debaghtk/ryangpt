to have you today here on my health podcast asked you're a very fit guy you've been my client for a long period of time you've done your diet nutrition but I've never asked you this question why did you get into this world of being a fitness influencer Guru and even having a world-class business about it so what's the story where did it start it actually started u quite early uh when I was growing up uh we were living in a joint family and my dad's younger brother used to be a great table tennis player we had a table at home and every day in the evening some 15 20 office friends would come home and the vibe used to be once again 15 20 people would come into your house to play table tennis they would play for 3 to four hours right and all the kids would be watching this yeah all the kids would be watching and playing also so we had no option than to you know just pick up the B bat and play because playing a sport was so glamorized uh back in the days in my house so that is where it actually started and table tennis is a fast sport requires a lot of agility and things like that so it's started there I picked up table tennis so my fitness journey started with playing a sport and then U uh because I had an opportunity of playing with people at home there were many good players who were coming to my house so I just got into playing table tennis well and was the icsc champion at some point very early uh in my school days then later I picked up basketball uh loved that sport played that for many years in Junior School uh so for many many years I was just playing Sports what also happened I started lifting weights around the age of 14 and that was a very different story so I was a very skinny kid uh and because of that I was subject to bullying and a lot of body shaming and uh you know all kind of unpleasant experiences especially to do with how you look so I wasn't very happy about where was this which part of India uh I I'm from North India I was born in Agra uh I studied in partly nital partly in theun a little bit in Agra so it was all in all uh those places uh so quite a bit of uh you know un pleas experiences happened and uh someone told me that if you go and start lifting weights it'll probably help you bulk up uh because that's what happens and it'll maybe help you in what you want to achieve so what is the starting point in this lifting weights like it was on small dingy gym in the school or in the city or something like that yeah so it was a very small uh very small gym in the city in in derun and my first experience at the gym was quite bad so I went I was very skinny I had a lot of experience in playing a sport but lifting weights nowhere close to uh doing that and in the first session uh the trainer pushed me quite hard and I couldn't I didn't know how to lift weights so I just couldn't do it very well and at the end of the session he told me it hurt my ego the next day I was so sore that I also got a fever I'm sensing I'm sensing you know if you go back and you Time Capsule this is where when you decided to start your fitness journey this thought was in your head don't over push people in their first workout exactly so this trainer over pushed you and then what happened then I was uh I just couldn't whatever he was ask me to do I couldn't do that much so he just told me this is not for you uh not in a very rude way it did hurt my ego uh went home wasn't very happy about it next day I got fever because of so excessive soreness and excessive fatigue and then I thought maybe lifting weights is not for me done but then at some point later another 6 or 7 months or so my brother my younger brother who still works with me uh he told me just give it one more shot so there was another gym called Power Pack gym in in theun and we've walked into that gym uh it was 400 rupees a month of membership very expensive for me at that point uh then I thought Let It Be anyways this is not for me I've been told he said no let's do it let's let's let's give it one more shot okay and then I started going to the gym the first day I walked in saw a bunch of bulky very muscular guys guys I was intimidated but then all of them were so helpful they taught me you know how to go about you were still about 14 15 years of age I was still 14 14 years of age to be precise uh they were like very helpful they you know taught me the right kind of movements they also told me not to go crazy about it they told me a little bit about uh nutrition at that time I mean nutrition advices were just flowing uh a little all over the place but whatever they knew they were helping me out with it what I took away from it is just eat a lot of food so I did that I lifted weights and I started bulking up all of that happened uh and throughout so many years I've been through those journeys of gaining weight losing weight and all of that has happened with me but that is not important what is important is that weightlifting was something that came as magical to me actually a personal transformation experience not from the point of view of how I look but from the point of view of how I feel and then I decided that I'm never going back this is something that I just want to do for the rest of my life so I continued uh lifting weights awesome so you know somebody didn't inspire you then a group of muscular guys inspiring you you were young you were impressionable and then featuring yourself to understand that this is something that gave you a good wife and it's not about looks but it's about how you feel so wonderful words of wisdom U obviously this journey that you started when very young in terms of weightlifting today you are one of the co-founders of one of the largest chains in the world of gyms and health clubs tell us a little bit about your cult field story where did that start so you obviously gyedu 2009 is when I finished my MBA and I started working in one of the biggest home and personal care brand in the world in sales and marketing a great experience I worked there for 2 years learned a lot but since it was in sales I was you know an fmcg I was out there on the road a lot uh while that was happening I was eating food outside not the best food uh from a health standpoint My Lifestyle was all over the place uh so from from being very fit I realize that I've started to gain weight uh and my lifestyle is you know it's not healthy it's it's actually very unhealthy so I wanted to make some change while I could really see myself growing in that job but I thought my health uh and my fitness is something that has done so much for me so far whatever I am is because you know I've been into health and fitness because that gave me the confidence to do anything at all so I need to do something about it so I started looking for another job where I could being a uh you know sit in an office and work still wanted to create the right kind of impact but I wanted u a very different workplace for myself fortunately got a job here in Bangalore so that was in 2011 I moved to Bangalore worked here for 4 and 1/2 years in corporate but during those 4 and a half years I got to travel a lot to different countries mostly in Europe so I used to go for assignments where I would stay in Amsterdam for 3 months or Finland for 3 months work there and while I was there I just found strike good amount of work life balance because of how people used to work there uh and I got access to some really good Fitness options so I got exposed to uh Brazilian jitu while I was in Amsterdam and because I came from a sporting background I just picked up the sport quite fast and Brazilian jitu is quite skillful it's got a lot of grappling and you can't just loosen yourself up while you are uh uh grappling with somebody because the moment you do it you're gone you you'll have to tap it out so from a fitness standpoint really good sport so I started doing Jitsu then I got exposed to CrossFit while I was in one of those places and then I realized that you know going versus going to a gym uh where there are machines and things like that nothing against it I right now you know as of this morning I lifted uh weights on on the machine that's really good but then CrossFit was very differentiated for me at that point it also allowed me me to uh work out at a pace that I love to work out at at that point so had I just started going deeper into uh the science of Fitness because just from uh coming from the point of view that this is something that I love to do a lot so I did a bunch of courses I started taking time off and you know go to thail Thailand for 3 weeks and just train do muai and lift weights and and nothing else while I was doing all of that I just thought that this is something that I love to do if and I know that this is something where I can create a lot of impact because if people are healthy if they are fit they will be happier there will be more productivity around and there will be better relationships around so this using health and fitness as an as an anchor can really help me do help me create the kind of impact that I want to create in this world so I thought that let me quit my full-time job and become a full-time Fitness professional one second so guy with MBA yeah traveling the world building businesses sales marketing desk job helping companies grow their businesses Because You Loved Fitness so much you said let me jump into this career yes purely because I could see myself creating the right kind of impact what did your family say yeah they were they were very supportive they were supportive they were supportive yeah in fact I mean I got a lot of help from my family when I was starting the first cult Center okay I got a lot of help uh from my from my so they knew you were passionate about Fitness even in your younger days yeah 100% in fact my mother was she's been into fitness a lot I keep posting about her on my Instagram and she lifts uh heavy weights right now but her fitness journey also goes uh way back so we were very inspired by uh you know what we' seen at home because I felt so passionately about becoming a fitness professional there was a lot of support uh from the family so being very fortunate from that point of view so you deed to become a fitness trainer in which city and at what timeline so actually started to get into deeper into fitness around 2012 2013 started doing courses started started teaching part-time uh in different places uh not for money just for experience I had a job and uh money was not the top of mind the top of Mind was learning and experience uh working with people in Fitness uh in that process I also you know got a lot of mentorship from coaches in different parts of the World some of them helped me set up the first cult Center here uh their facilities became the inspiration for the first cult Center that I had set up so the first center that I put up in sarjapur was a warehouse and if you go to Thailand you'll see a lot of Warehouse gym so the inspiration was coming from different places where IID uh where I trained so 2015 is when I decided to quit full-time and start uh the first cult Center May 2015 is when we had started it out how did you find the first place cuz there are a lot of people out there who are into fitness and you know they're like What's his story I know how did you find your first warehouse and did you have enough money for a deposit uh didn't have enough money for uh uh for the investment that had to happen uh so the place we found was not a warehouse it was an empty piece of land we created that from scratch we are still running that Center um so I would that Center is very it's like your first baby basically exactly correct so the how I found it was I just get on a bike and just go around and see where there are uh places boards boards or or anything that I can find I didn't want to get a broker because you would have to pay that much money to pay and I didn't want to pay that kind of money at that time so I just go on the bike and uh fortunately the security person in the building where I was staying knew uh someone who owns a piece of land um a little on the inside typically if you see gyms are on you know main roads and all so that there is visibility but then rental disadvantage I've always thought about that I don't think your gym needs to be on the main road in today's day and age because you have got social media and when you see one fit guy he will tell 10 people where he goes to train I agree with you yes so wow wonderful so you've went on your bike and I'm seeing you driving your bike and you're going and uh okay you find you found this off thebeat uh place and then what happened uh then just negotiated with the landlord and said we want to open a gym here he was confused what kind of a gym will you open you know here in this Lane uh and it was just a plot of land it was an empty piece of piece of land we cleared it off did the foundation and we built that fabricated uh structure uh the landord was like fine do it I don't really see this working out but if you want to do it do it we got at a pretty competitive rent because it was inside uh the landlord wasn't planning to do much with that piece of land so uh the rentals were quite good and that was and you continue to be there today we we still run we still run that facility we have many other centers now in and around that area uh but we still run uh that facility so I had a great rent Advantage I could the money that I was saving in rent I could use that money to get some coaches from other countries so some of the best people that I had trained with for the first center for the first few months I got them from those places to to Bangalore uh took up a flat on rent for all of them so they have a comfortable stay here so there were people for example there there were two coaches from Thailand both of them could not speak Hindi or English or they could just speak Tha but they were brilliant in what they did so they would take their muai sessions in their language but people here understood everything they said because it was just coming from the heart and there was people respected those coaches so much people just listen to all their instructions patiently and they were all getting better at at the sport and at at Fitness so that is that is how it all so it goes to say that if your heart and mind is in Fitness no matter the type of Fitness uh you will connect and I think this is an important point that you're making which is that a lot of people enter into fitness with this sole weight loss goal in mind yeah which is in my opinion arriving from a place of negativity you're unhappy with your body therefore you might be unhappy with this Fitness activity taking up but what you're telling me is when these coaches came in and in spite of a language barrier people took up the training and loved it and they were able to progress forward how did you go from one gym a few formats so you had maai I'm I'm I'm I'm presuming Brazilian jiu-jitsu was there maybe some CrossFit was there what else was there in the first format so when we started it was were the dumbells in your gym there there were dumbbells there were there were barbells and there was a boxing ring uh there were no machines though and there was the people used to walk and it was very different uh because of it was very first of all it's a warehouse and then it's an open space there are climbing ropes and there is a boxing ring there are dumbbells Etc but there are no machines inquiries would come in and they used to ask it's great whatever you told me I loved it your trainers are super fit uh I can see people are enjoying here that was the we used we were running boxing classes it's like intense cardio for it's even worse uh in fact um if I can share with you and your viewers I think basically skiing karate and boxing have the highest calorie burn when I start planning a diet chart wow so it's not treadmill running at the end of the day you know but okay so you had this and people tread were you getting scared key was membership really good so you were able to sustain so we were u i mean while people had these questions uh we were like mean we giving trial classes for free there's no in doing it if you want to go to the gym that is just down the lane here that has treadmills and all kind of machines you may need it's also cheaper than you know much cheaper than the kind of membership that we are charging for but we are charging for coaching our people who train here have done their art for more than 20 years at least there's a there was a coach that we had 25 years of age his total muai experience was 21 years so he started started training at the age of four he started fighting in Thailand at the age of six fighting as in in the ring so that's the kind of experience that people were coming with that's the kind of passion that they were coming does cult still have the muai classes today we don't we don't do muai right now we've we over a period of time uh we zeroed down on what works for the Indian audience basically so what's working for India today I understand you have hundreds of gyms so your cult field centers have evolved let's not call them gyms the centers have evolved your Fitness Studios have evolved so what's what's the formats that are available if somebody wants to do a training so right now uh so we have two kind of we also have gyms and it's a pretty large footprint for us right now uh group class is what we started with within the group class uh centers we have uh strength and conditioning and we have HX workout which we created with Rik rosan uh that is where people predominantly lift weights and uh the footfall in those formats is quite quite good people are loving lifting weights uh there are so many people I know who are who are starting their weight training Journey with these formats uh then there is Dance Fitness uh again another top favorite of our members it's so much fun you you know there's music our trainers are great uh that mosphere is amazing uh so Dance Fitness is is there it continues to be a great format for us uh and and then we have yoga because we also need to focus on recovery and improving their Mobility stability balance and everything uh and we have boxing so these are our all in all these are the major formats that we've zeroed down on over last so many years so when did you know that you're going to go from a one cult fit Center to hundreds how did that Journey happen uh was it family and friends that came in and gave you a lot of cash and then you started or your employees invested or there was that one person that you met along the way that just you know said okay let's do this so initially it was to set up the first center it was a lot of help from the family I requested my sister to invest in the uh first center she agreed and she did that uh I asked my wife to that I'm going to live off her salary she said fine I think all of us have done that some point me also is an entrepreneur I remember the first year my entire salary was paid by by my wife when we started business bues yeah so that and then I had some savings so I thought let me make sure that I have no I'm and you had you didn't have your baby by then right this was long time I was very recently married uh just one year back I had gotten married what did your in-laws think about you starting a he was a MBA guy working for a topshot company consultancy company and now suddenly he's opening up as a gym you know people think Gym trainer right so was there any resistance from your in-law side and no I think they were they were pretty chilled out about it so they're like fine I mean I I've never had that discussion with them but I'm sure ASA had uh but I I think they were like whatever you guys are happy doing do it we've done our part so so so you know you're taking your bike and searching in the B Lanes to find this gym how did it happen that you know you got uh expanding yeah so um then very fortunately I met Mukesh bunel the Mukesh bunel Mukesh bansel uh I he was one of our first few members so for those who don't know Mukesh bansel was the founder of mintra and um he sold that off to Flipkart and then rishab happened to meet him yes in the training in yeah he uh he happened to walk into the first uh cult Center so there's a lake we open opposite a lake and at that Lake a lot of people come there for running and Mukesh also used to come there regularly to run and walk and things so he just saw this and saw you know our it's look looks like that these people are doing MMA and boxing and they're doing something which is uh different very fit person uh very very driven from you know uh from a workout standpoint so he just walked in uh I took his trial session and U he bought the membership over a period of that journey I just realized that uh like he he was very supportive U and I realized that if I'm just getting some time from him that's a big deal because most early uh stage entrepreneurs don't get that kind of mentorship uh he was very suppored in terms of mentoring me just telling me the best practices in terms of customer experience how to scale the business and everything else else around it so I just learned a lot from him and finally you know he decided to start a uh you know Healthcare uh Venture called kit and uh I just wanted to work with him so we we got talking I was anyway you know um working with him from from the from a standpoint that I was reaching out to him for mentorship for guidance whenever I needed uh he was going to help me scale the business uh from the outside to a certain extent but when curefit happened uh we decided to get this partnership to a much deeper level and that is when cult got acquired by kit and I joined the uh kit team started working with uh with Mukesh the thing was that uh Mukesh has built businesses in the past he is a very seasoned entrepreneur and he knows how to scale businesses that's not what I know if I had to scale it on my own I can guarantee I wouldn't have been able to do it but what I know is how to train people the right way and I could see this as the lifetime opportunity for me to be able to train millions of people I couldn't have done it on my own so I thought this while I understand right now I own this gym tomorrow I will not be the owner of this gym because I'm going to end up selling it but that's fine eventually if you create the right kind of impact that's it that's what we all need to do so I made that call and that is where the Journey of actual cult that people see right now started so that was one phase of your life where now you went you met mesh and you've gotten this expansion going and you're part of the team that sits in the driver's seats and says okay we want to make an impact on people how has it had an impact on your personal life now that cult is almost visible in every neighborhood across the country how is it that it's affected your personal life you recently had a baby yes about a year ago so becoming a father so one is you had the first baby which was the gym now you have your own baby so what's life and how has it changed for you yeah I think uh first of all has had a major impact on my life my life can like easily be divided between what was before cult and what is after cult I I know for a fact that I'm a changed person after that I know for a fact that people who know me they can just you know validate uh this statement that rishab is a change person after cult happened um and it's just the because I was so passionate about this business I just started spending a lot of time uh at the gym I also started to because I was around equipment and very fit people all the time so I just started working a lot on myself I also never had the opportunity to because we employ uh so many trainers uh across you know so so many of our centers and I never had the opportunity to inspire people the way I do right now I was never in a role where people would look up to me so it was very important for me to lead by example to walk the top so I had to really really work on myself my own Fitness my health uh my knowledge my skill upgrade Etc so I just really had to spend a lot of time doing all of those things which meant I couldn't spend time meeting people and socializing and all of that but fine that if that change had to happen for good that had to happen no regrets um on that U angad uh my son was born 18 months ago and that was another transformative experience I just like my mindset just changed overnight everything changed for me after it happened in in in multiple ways he's just clarified the priorities uh for me uh again because I want to make sure I understand that how important health is in anybody's life I very strongly feel health and exercise and Fitness and Nutrition should be the top of mind for pretty much everybody because that drives everything else in your life so uh I and I really want angard to be uh following a healthy path I want him to probably pursue a sport I'm just I'm just visualizing that anger's going to have a table tennis in your house and he's going like my crazy dad's invited the whole neighborhood to play table tennis in fact uh so uh so he's never seen any kind of uh you know the kind of content that keeps floating around on on on on phones and iPads and all right now so he's not seen any of that until now but he sees his dad work out right he sees me work out and the only thing that he sees he's so far Seen On TV is Cricket so he thinks this thing is Cricket you know you turn it on and and playing Cricket so he's now he's just 18 months old he picks up a ball he's trying to do some bowling actions and after he bowls he says how's that you know so so I'm just saying that I just want to give him the best environment possible so that he can make the right decisions uh for himself so I've just started again uh working a lot more on myself I wake up at 4:45 I finish my workout by what time do you go to sleep I sleep by so he sleeps quite early he would like we start winding down at 7:00 p.m. which means our dinner is done by 6:30 6:45 uh wind down starts at 7:00 8:00 p.m. is when he sleeps off between 8: to 9: is when I would just sleep off so when he sleeps off I do my uh just next to him uh I do my foam rolling and some amount of Mobility I so you're you're around but he's like he's sensing the parents' presence and he's nodding off to sleep yes and then I would just get into bed uh put on my reading light read a little bit and then uh fall asleep so it gets to 8:30 8:45 but that's that's the max wake up at 4:45 uh uh I don't eat anything in the morning before workout uh because mentally I want to work out I want to move before I put anything something into uh mentally it just it just works better for me uh it just it just connects better with my identity for everyone out there at some point of your life you would have eaten before a workout as a trainer because everyone says that right but now you've evolved like You' evolved in your business you've evolved with a sun you've also evolved in your choices of eating this evolving how did you feel when you ate and worked out and how do you feel now without working out because I want to know your perspective I don't know I've been doing fasted workouts for a while now and I love my energy in the morning when I eat food first thing in the morning uh you feel sluggish I feel a little uh because it probably takes time to digest and things like that so I'm just better off uh using what I ate in dinner as my pre-workout first thing in the morning but for sure if I'm working out later in the day I'm pretty sure I'll need to uh need to load some food uh but I generally don't work out that late I just work out work out early you it's it's it's amazing that you're doing this because most of the clients that I worked with including you um they all evolve and they always ask what's the right type of workout and what's the right type of diet but if you dig a little bit deeper you'll begin to figure out what works for your body what is your bio individuality you know this idea that you work out so early in the morning to to India this is foreign you know getting to bed at 9:00 I don't think anybody on the planet does that right and so like how can this guy do it and but it's part of your life yes you run a very successful Fitness business fitness gyms and Studios open up at 5:00 a.m. in the morning obviously you want to lead by example one of the leading by example is getting up that early in the morning do you take a nap in the middle of the day I'd love to take a nap but uh I'm not able to do that because I have to be at work uh through the day so not able to take a nap but weekends I do for sure again Ang takes a nap in the afternoon I just go and use that opportunity to you know snuggle up and take a nap with him uh 20 30 minutes but that's golden if I can do that every day I'd love it so now that you've identified your space uh with your family and your business you know your son is the center of your Universe we see a lot of unhealthy children you mentioned strongly that I want to give give him the best opportunity for fitness and that word came in very strongly a lot of our Indian children are not healthy you're a father today you run a very successful Fitness business what is your advice to India from their children's upbringing right from you know you said you put your son to sleep at 8:00 I used to put my son to sleep at 8:00 when I tell my clients put your children to bed early oh no 10:30 11: is a normal time can you give us a message as one of India's leading Fitness gurus on how important it is to bring up our children correctly how important is for parents to lead by example that's the most important thing if you think about it they are the future of the country they need to be fit and we got them into this world it is our responsibility to make sure that we give them the best environment possible what all we need to do is give them the environment everything else they will pick up and they will do what you do so very important for us to Walk The Talk lead by example we can ask them to play a sport or to go for a run in the morning I mean of course when they grow up a little bit we can ask them to do whatever we want to do but if we don't do that ourselves they will just not be interested in it so we have to be out there doing those things ourselves for example I would be very happy while angad has all the independence in the world to do whatever he wants but I would be happy if he pursues a sport for that what's important today today it's important that is Dad plays a sport so I play basketball once a week I go for swim a couple of times a week and I make sure that I compete at some level of course I'm not competing at a very high level right now but wherever there has to be some competition some sport in my life so angut can see that my dad's you know getting me a medal at home and he's so excited about it that's that's very inspirational because if your child you know constantly tell your child you need to come first in class you need to come first in running race you need to be good in basketball but if as a parent you're kind of leading by example so that's so inspirational that's what's needed I mean we need to wake up early if you want them to wake up early we need to wake up early so now that you've established everything business set and he's the center of your universe how important is Fitness you're one of the health gurus of the country when the members come to you take gym membership your Fitness membership how do you inspire them as parents to work out how do you inspire them to take care of the children what is the routine routin let let us know how you can Inspire India I think this is one one of the most important things that we can do as parents kids our children country future say they are going to you know Define fine I mean nothing against education and and pedagogy and things like that let the be there do you be really coordinated Master leader look at him look at him like how he you know makes decisions on the Fly weak like even I was very weak I was on the volleyball team so what should parents look for or to advise the children in sports team team team manip in in team sports so what I'm trying to say is if I don't play a sport I mean I can ask angad as much as I can to go and play basketball and do go for a run and things like that now he has all the independ tendence to be whatever he wants to be at a later point he can choose his career but I will be happy if he pursues a sport that that purple Papa orange belt purple Bel competition actually as a father felt I have to do better exactly at some point they'll start giving us competition like you said but we have to be inspirational it starts here he eats from my plate right now do you smoke no I don't do you drink very rarely but not in front of your kit uh I mean I do it in front of him because um I think as long as I have a healthy relationship with alcohol I would let him see it the problem however gets to the point where the relationship with alcohol is bad my father was an alcoholic and everything that I saw with alcohol was like really bad it was just stress the if you ask my mother and which is why I feel I can't keep him away from things like that I can't keep him away from having to see people drinking alcohol or but you're also discipl disciplin yes I mean even if I drink I can't drink more than a pint I'm done you got you're done but but is this true gym trainers fitness trainers Fitness how to build the body and all that they know that the Nasha of alcohol is not helping them in their workout the next day or for the next 10 15 days so is this a common thing among all your trainers and all that you know alcohol consumption is kept to a low because it affects the body yeah our trainers are uh you know by Design very healthy and fit people um they also work very hard they on their toes they also have to be mentally sharp because we are very focused on customer experience as a brand they can't really I mean people can't really in that job people can't afford to be drinking alcohol regularly at least I mean I know there is I'm sure you will support this point Al true and then next morning you wake up dehydrated you don't feel fresh your workout is not that great so it's your entire next day is gone and if your day is gone as a trainer then that's just impacting so many other people passionate about Fitness what are the criterias that you as rishab look for when recruiting a trainer unes mean what are the qualification tick marks required for let's say anybody listening in to become a good trainer first thing I look for is uh purely passion for passion definitely that is definitely one checkpoint for me I need people to walk the talk uh but even before that are you somebody who would like to teach people are you somebody who gets excited not like that first Gym trainer exactly exactly that guy maybe he's really fit well built but he's not a teacher they need to be do I have the ability to teach yes exactly to be a guru to somebody people generally get confused between being enthusiastic about Fitness or being a customer of fitness and being a trainer both are different things you have to be enthusiastic about Fitness I agree to be a trainer but just because you are enthusiastic about Fitness Fitness does not make you a trainer to what temperament Fitness also is a hard thing for people when people come into the gym I mean we are asking them to move we are challenging their movement pattern we asking them to you know lift heavy weights Etc it just requires a lot of patience to you know teach people uh the right way of moving and patience exactly so teaching patience confidence confidence why confidence because uh I mean when you have to be you have to have a very strong point of view about things that you are telling people there is also so much information all over the Internet different and all of those things are there so as a trainer you need to make sure that you know your thing and you're able to communicate it really well in case of group classes if you are taking a class of 25 30 people and if you are not confident about what you're saying why should people even why will they even listen to you I think they will not follow you then they will not be able to follow you so interviews trainers so there was until many centers I used to interview each and every trainer coming into cult toti Kata harana all these different places to just find talent and interview them open field recruit dangal based so some great athletes and everybody would come wherever I saw that there is a guy who's struggling a little bit in explaining things to me just because they're hesitating it's not that they don't know the concept they're probably hesitating to that the only thing I wanted to see is he willing to put himself or herself outside their comfort zone or not g Squad I can teach you that you can always learn the subject matter but if we don't have the internal conviction then we useless I just wanted to see is this person really serious about this job because that required I mean they've never faced a crowd a kind of people that would you know come to places like cult they hesit they're hesitating in a one-on-one discussion and I know this guy will probably not do a great job you know you know from that corner he'll not be able to just he's just you know terribly challenged uh from from standpoint that maybe he could get embarrassed is what I'm trying to say but if the guy made the effort for me that's a win for me that's a checkpoint now let me go to the next stage I will teach him how to teach a squat no problem but this guy stick the box for me do you think trainers shelf life is also limited because it's based on looks also because you have to look good and so maybe by the time they're 354 the career starts dwindling because this is what I have heard 354 is not it's not old it's actually very young U so that is an advantage of being in this profession uh both even from how you move even from the point of view of having aches and pains or how you look you will not be looking old benefit of doing Fitness but otherwi you can you probably charge more for for what you do you don't have to take that's very true because I remember once I hired a taii instructor and um he a young boy 22 23 so he came in for the first workout and he asked me to do push-ups with my my elbows inverted without even doing a body assessment mhm and I was like P I'm 45 years of age and you're asking I I can do a normal push-up I can do a fist push-up but I can't do this push-up he nothing happens you can do it so I think what you're saying about the wisdom right so as you get older you have more experience you tend to understand people more and therefore you're able to guide better so sometimes a a more educated trainer may not be more smarter than a more experienced trainer and you need both you need both you need a balance of both yeah so even for like these 35 40 year old folks uh who've been into the fitness industry for a long time it is very important for them to keep upgrading their skill set there is I mean science is evolving every day you can't be talking things that were fresh 20 years back you can't be talking those things today to what upgrade and that's the reality of Fitness industry C I always say that so I think you don't you really start implementing science after one or two years of sincere training first you get the basics right but but speaking about wisdom and experience videy weight training weight training elderly especially ladies mmy really she lifs good weights how is it benefiting her why is Mr rishab making his mama do weight training what is the story behind it what is the science behind it so uh after the age of 30 all of us would typically start losing 3 to 8% of muscle mass per decade then women especially after they hit menopause they lose muscle mass and bone mass really quick we all will lose bone mass as as we age but women after menopause they will lose it really Qui quick uh and which makes it makes them more susceptible to getting fractures uh and falls so that's the problem the problem actually is that it's not not lift you know losing bone mass is not good for the quality of your life we know that lifting weights can really slow that process down and help prevent that uh loss of bone and loss of muscle direct implication on how you move how you feel uh you know get nobody likes to get fractures right so those kind of things and which is why I feel it's very important for pretty much every body to lift weights and even more important for women and if you think about it in the early days of human evolution it was women who us alive right all the lifting of of the food preparation exactly they would do all of that work which means they've been lifting weights since then not to mention there is child birth and the fact that women it's women who carry their children much more than men even you know children they want to be carried more by by the mothers so they've again lifting weights is very natural to them lifting and carrying weights is it's the most natural thing that a woman can do now there will be people who say and and then they would say things like it'll make you look manly it'll you know all those kind of stupid things because muscles and I'm saying stupid because muscles don't really have a gender right muscles are not reserved for any gender in fact muscles only have a functionality they exist to uh to make you move to make you work to keep you healthy and which is why I really very strong recommendation for all the women out there to prioritize weightlifting and they don't have to get intimidated by the big machines or the big guys at the gym like I said some of the big guys were really helpful for me so just walk in ask for help and start that Journey today so how often does a lady maybe plus 30 plus 40 plus 50 he need to work out per week at least three times a week I think uh three to they should be lifting weights three to five times um in a week uh that's what my mother does also she goes with me five times uh five times a week was she already working out before you started this cult fit Journey she was always uh a fit person conscious about Fitness um so she uh used to do aerobics and a lot of endurance training uh when she got she got married at an early age uh and um at my dad's house they had this well so what she used to do was just pull out water from that well about 40 buckets in a day that's that's like legitimate strength training right most people I know right now won't train like that she was also young and you know her body was supporting that kind of activity so she's been working out since then of course there was no trainer there was no gym then she got chance to work with an aerobics trainers so she worked a lot on her endurance because she was was very fit when my cousin needed a kidney she was able to uh you know donate one of her kidneys because so your mom does weight training after donating a kidney to one of your cousins it's been uh 12 or 13 years since she donated one kidney and she's been lifting weights like in a gym like I said pulling water out of the well and all is also weight weight training she would have carried the three of us for uh me and you know my siblings for for a long time that it's also weight training but she's been lifting weights at the gym since cult started so since 2015 she's been regularly lifting weights at the gym M So speaking of lifting weights and you're talking about moving how is how important besides your mother is it important for everybody in the family to move 100% because when you see people working out is I mean there is something about Fitness that spills over so the bottom line is that if you are a fit person if you're somebody who works out every day I can guarantee you will be more productive at work I can guarantee you'll have better relationships you will be you'll of course be healthier because that's what exercise does to you but you'll also be happier because you know you have no aches and pains and you're able to do your own work you are much better at the activities of daily living so there is a lot of happiness around you and what there's one more thing about you know doing Fitness or or doing things that are opposite is when you are with people who are doing that particular thing you are also more likely to do that particular thing so if you become somebody who works out people around you will be working out and then people around them will be working out and that just becomes a chain and as a nation we become much fitter much happier much productive much like going to the movies you know it becomes a culture hey let's go for a movie hey let's start moving you know hey let's go for a walk together hey let's go cycling together so exactly so wise points now speaking of people moving okay exercise variable P trackers pendrive so everything's getting Tech techsavvy and everything you know you're in that Cutting Edge world of expanding your gyms the exercise industry the fitness industry you have Rik Roshan on your team advising fitness programs and attracting people to workout as you explore are there any secrets in technology that are coming out or do you see any promising Trends as a guru in Fitness that you're like I think this is going to become something good for us to have as part of our gyms or as part of our exercise training regimes I think um as the awareness about Fitness continues to increase people have started to realize that uh working out at a pace which allows them to work out Nicely versus just going crazy in the workout is something that would keep them uh consistent in the workout for a long for a long run and people are also understanding the importance of consistency and compounding over over many years so I really see uh moderate intensity workouts uh from a weight training standpoint where people are working out taking some rest and then working out again but making sure that they are recovering enough between sets to get a great workout by the end of it so I see that happening I also see a lot of focus on joint health uh I talk to a lot of people because I I really want to be aware about you know what's the problem that I should be solving today versus 5 years down the line uh and I just keep talking to people and I've realized that uh uh most of them that I speak to have started talking about joint health have started talking about the fact that you know I want to be fit when I'm 60 years old I've seen my only yesterday some when a woman told me that uh I'm very inspired by my grandmother my grandmother at the age of 90 does all her work on her own I want to be like her I don't know if I'm going to live until 90 by the way but even if I live till whatever 60 65 70 I want to be like her and I know that lifting weights doing cardio is going to give me the energy to be like her so I I see people uh focusing a lot on longevity I see people focusing a lot on uh health span and those things look like the upcoming Trends to me uh from a technology standpoint of course there are these uh trackers which can track your sleep trackers which can track the quality of your workout uh and all those things while this it's not necessity I feel uh because eventually if you wake up and feel fresh you know that your sleep was great right if you if you feel like you know you can you know jump out of your bed get a great workout then you don't need a Tracker to uh to tell you that's so true actually you know I'm I mean um many of times if I know I get that 8 hours of sleep the whole of next day is just like so calm yeah and so happy yeah you feel like doing things right so yeah so feeling good in the morning getting up with or without technology many people will be watching this podcast and be saying should I do Fitness should I not do Fitness what is the maximum goal when people come to cult fit like statistically the beginners come in what is their predominant goal yeah to I've seen at a different point in time in life people have different goals now it could be like there could be a 40-year-old who wants to look absolutely shredded at an individual level or anecdotal references we will have you know all kind of scenarios but on an average what I have found after talking to people is Young like in you know 18 20 24 25 years old time majority of go to look betters I want to look a certain way body B and that's the reason I'm going to the gym and I want it fast time but as they keep maturing in that journey and it goes through a lot of ups and downs we've all had gone through that but as they mature in age the goals start to look like fine looking good is going to be a byproduct of lifting weights and doing cardio and eating healthy what I really care about is can I can I move well um I feel very stiff in the morning what I really care about is do I wake up without aches and pains and that's what people are telling uh people are and the example that I gave you right this woman who wants to be like a grandmother doing being very independent with her own work and everything else the logo goals from just looking good it changes to feeling better it changes to uh having no living a pain-free life it changes to being very healthy overall Jo health element the focus comes from just looking good more towards a wellness uh Spectrum so that is how I see the goals evolving but I'm pretty sure all of us go through you know that that Journey most of us go through that Journey yeah I remember when I was young I my first time I hit the gym was in 10 standard and I remember I went with one of my friends and uh the coach said the exact same thing that you got because I was a skinny kid right and and the coach says to my friend yeah you can do the weight training but you're not meant for weight training and that really hurt you know and uh I used to be on the college powerlifting team okay right and so as a skinny individual I could lift really heavy and we were the gold medal winning team uh and so the younger years was like muscle banan body banan protein powder whatever possible I tried and I realized that somehow maybe my the Apple you know doesn't fall far away from the tree the genetics the mommy Papa so they were skinny but now at the age of 48 U I keep telling my trainer I should be able to touch my toes uh you know I should be able to tie my shoelaces um you know bend down I should be able to do a squat and sit down in a squat for 2 and a half minutes you know I should be able to do my Surya namaskars um I should be able to lift my son who is 30 kgs correct right so small small things like that are more valuable today than body banan but you you pointed on a point which was how important that people want to burn fat and J what are rishab Tang's five tips over the years that you have learned for fat loss yeah I will uh I keep getting this question so pretty much top of mine I just sum it up First Nutrition is the most important thing when you want to lose fat first thing is eat less food and we live in a society where second eat sufficient amount of protein uh I again spoke to quite a few people and I told them I'd like to help you with your goals just tell me what your day looks like uh what do you eat through the day what what you know what are your goals while people felt that they're eating a lot of protein they didn't have protein uh in their diet so I feel that there is a change that we can make and I'm not saying go overboard but they should eat sufficient amount of protein third lift weights three to five times a week go to the gym and challenge yourself you got to work hard at the gym fourth sleep actually I'll bring sleep on the top sleep is everything sleep bad sleep is going to disrupt your eating Behavior bad sleep is going to disturb your workout quality to sleep and I've been through a very rough phase in my own life with respect to sleep but sleep then you have no business worrying about fat loss fix that first because otherwise nothing is happening and finally you got to uh make sure that you're getting off the couch so move a lot through the day when I was uh with you on my nutrition plan um I remember you told me to walk yeah because L whilst you looked very fit you had a little bit of a higher visceral fat and that could be your genetic correct you know as a marvadi you get that genetic programming into you where fat deposition is higher you don't see it because you're pretty flat but when the wing scale went internal and so we realize that walking was the only thing that would help you out no I and I was honestly you change a lot in my uh eating pattern I've learned so much just being on a plan with you I learned so much about myself like the kind of food that just does not agree uh with my gut the the kind of food that probably disturbs my sleep so a lot of learning happened in that process so while I came to you uh I'm going off topic but uh since we've got gotten it while I came to you with the goal of I don't know if you remember now but my goal was like do better at sports improve exercise performance build a lot of muscle mass shred body fat and those things happened and I if I remember it right I dropped 4 to 5% body fat in the first month in the first four weeks of being on a plan with you all of that happened so when I came to you I used to get a little before that for a few years I used to keep getting uh a sore throat very often like pretty much twice a month or something like that and I went to doctors they gave me um uh anti- acidity pills and some other medication and someone told me that you may have guard we may have to operate it and things like that so in in my mind I thought maybe I'll have to get it operated maybe I have some something going on which I don't know about but when I came to you with a different goal you fix my food all of that goals I achieved but what I achieved was I like for one one and a half two years after that I didn't get a sore throat uh and I realized that it was probably because of the acidity that was happening and with good food it just you know took care of the acidity and throat was so the The Secret bill in all of that is just a simple concept whilst you can have a fitness diet with the right amount of carbs and protein and fat most people don't do a little bit of a deep dive into what fat what protein what carb correct and the quantity and the timing exactly so once you start getting this aligned which is what you did you came in and you paid for a six-month plan and then you started aligning it and then you started preparing it so you already had the knowledge but probably the execution and the small all filtrations of The Good the Bad and the Ugly did not happen and I think that's the basic part that most people in the fitness journey should subscribe to like you said no sleep is very important and one part to fix your sleep is not eating the wrong Foods um after 5:00 in the evening uh you can never uh outrun a bad diet and you can't um you know um out eat bad sleep exactly so these a lot of powerful things that you have done and it changed your health so I think uh you evolve to a level where you are now I'm athletic I'm pushing my body the highest level of training let's go back to the ABC of nutrition which I think most people are trying to wing it and sometimes they're listening to uh a huge plora of advices yeah that's a problem just taking nutrition advice off the internet is you know your mom and my mom are both nutritionist at the end of the day so you know everyone's a subject matter expert on that and So speaking about subject matter experts we'll come back to your profession which is Fitness what are the common mistakes that people make in Fitness when they start out I think the biggest mistake that people make is going too far too soon so people when they start fitness journey they would probably buy an annual membership and like I said they want to also achieve that goal fast and then they will be out of the fitness journey is over for most people so going too far too soon is a big problem second people just want to and it is maybe because they see things on Instagram and they see things on YouTube people deadlifting heavyweight the thing is that they just want to start loading heavyweight and going ahead of the curve while the reality is if the train slow one step at a time they will get to that weight they will get to that Fitness level but they want to do it in that in that week immediate imediate fast food fast body fast workout yeah exactly and then comparing yourself with with other people either at the gym or on social media that's a big problem even I have this problem and I've never been able to take it out of me it's like I always compare myself to a younger kid or a guy's got like beefy muscle like why can't I have his muscles why can't I lift like him so you're saying don't compare yourself to somebody else yeah I'm just saying just look at yourself have your how do I do that like do I keep like a card okay last month I deadlifted 40 kgs then next month I do 45 kgs so that is one way of doing it that you keep a workout log and you know that your overall workout volume is going up which means the amount of work that you've done has significantly increased over last month and it is going up month over month so you're doing great if you're doing that you will obviously build muscle so you can do your body composition check uh at a 4-we interval or 8 weeks interval whatever works for you but do that body composition check take your progress pictures because that is the truth if you see yourself in a mirror or on a camera and if you think yeah I've put on some muscle that's it it doesn't matter how other person looks like because it is you versus you you just have to make sure that you are getting better every day I love that statement you versus you brilliant so if somebody wanted to copy you you know you starting in the gym say a 14 year-old is listening in or 18 year old is listening in and they starting from zero and they want to become like you quickly what would they need to do just focus on the fundamentals what are they things like your Mobility stability like I there's one phrase that I really like love we do Mobility first because we didn't show up in the crib doing side planks ah you got my point yeah uh and as children Mobility comes very naturally to us right all those children they can uh put their uh toe in the mouth and all those things they can do right so Mobility is not a problem it's only over the years it becomes a problem for us so make sure that you restore that Mobility you make sure that you get that mind muscle Connection in place you teach your muscles how to fire and that happens through movement pattern training so there are basic movement patterns right you and I are sitting on this chair and we'll get get up from it what is that that's a squat we just need to make sure that we are able to do those movements properly with the right muscles firing at the right time and then eventually we are able to do that with load on it and that load will keep going up that's the process or uh like squat is one pattern hinge is another pattern Push Pull uh carry all those things you know we need to just teach our body how to do those movement patterns properly so my advice would be to just take it slow focus on the fundamentals and don't look at exercise as just exercise uh while you exercise also focus on eating well while you focus on exercise and eating well focus on following a good sleep hygiene also focus on recovery very important part what's your recovery uh routine I kind of spend uh a lot of time on my recovery uh um and especially after having a child I just change my workout and I do workout a lot you would have seen on my Instagram right I'm kind of working out all the time um and which means that I'm spending a equal amount of time doing things that are not there uh on my social media so uh when it comes to recovery the first thing is the best recovery tool is your sleep I mean no matter how much people tell you you know do that protocol do this protocol if you're not sleeping well nothing is going to work so you figured it out you figured that out and that's why by 8:00 to 9:00 you're in that zone to get ready to sleep yeah I'm inan I'm in the zone at 7 like I would keep screens away and so so so rishab at her party is not much fun right after 8:00 you won't see me at parties I remember for New Year's uh my entire family was over and I'm constantly looking at the clock for it to come 12:00 and the moment it hit 12:00 at 12:15 I was telling my whole family okay come on everyone get out go home I need to go to sleep you know because we were awake by 7:00 in the morning so I get this thing that you you sleep is a good recovery sleep is number one anything else in recovery yeah of course so after sleep it is what you eat if you're eating a good well balanced diet that is going to help you uh uh recover faster for your future workout sessions and third easy and light movements like things like foam rolling soft tissue work doing some good amount of Mobility work uh doing deep stretches or just doing low intensity cycling all these things of doing a yoga class for example these things really help uh in recovering faster once all these things are in place consider doing an ice path and you know all those protocols that are generally spoken about they will help for sure but that's probably the top of the pyramid the bottom of the pyramid is you know these three things that I spoke about yeah you know you did say somewhere that you had sleep problems and now you've overcome them um what do you did what did you do specifically if you can remember to transition from that stressful part lesser sleep hectic lifestyle into a more healthier lifestyle a deeper sleep yeah so um I had a very rough phase uh with sleep for like I wouldn't sleep for weeks together and it was tough it was hard I also in that but I kept hammering myself at the gym so in that process I ended up hurting my spine so I liveed with a structural spine injury and I LIF with a structural spine injury uh that's a part of my life but I feel it happened because of bat sleep and lack of recovery therefore how I fixed my sleep is I just realized that it's behaviors first that you fix your behaviors and your sleep automatically starts to get better and sleep is not just the night time your preparation to sleep actually starts in the morning so I started getting in I started a habit of meditation at that time and I started with very it's very hard for me to meditate to sit that still for like 10 minutes or 20 minutes but I pushed myself into it and I used to the first thing in the morning I used to meditate Under the Sun so that exposure to sunlight which I still do right now that's mandatory for me and my son we have to get that morning uh sun exposure and evening sun exposure also for him so I started meditating Under the Sun I think that played a really important role in just making sure that my day goes very nicely without much stress and everything I also second thing I did was an early dinner so I just uh uh finish my dinner off at uh I mean right now I'm doing at 6 6:30 but at that time early dinner was like 8:00 p.m. uh for me so I started doing dinner slightly early compared to 10:30 11 habit of feating very late at that time that really helped uh and just overall working out um in the first part of the day was something that worked well for me I also limited C caffeine intake significantly I love my coffee I drink a lot of coffee right now but after 12 there's a full stop after 12 no coffee I remember when we were working together uh two things that I knew that were going to affect your sleep was caffeine and the branchin amino acids yes and a lot of workout Executives uh will take a preworkout caffeine shot at 7:00 8:00 in the evening that you get a sleep but you get a very light sleep yeah so when you get up in the morning you don't feel fully rested because you didn't hit you didn't hit the Deep sine wave sleep and um I've had people who are even sensitive to uh BCA from whe protein and so the moment we give the BCA or the way protein in the morning or we changed the work out to the morning uh they just started getting deeper sleep so these These are small things that you know um will start popping out with people trying to do Fitness and in the Fitness World you know you um I see a lot of your Instagram videos and stuff like that what are your favorite uh movements uh in the world of Fitness if you had to choose like you know whenever people come for my counseling I say choose only five foods you can eat on the planet so rishab if you had to choose only five movements for fitness what would those movements be first is going to be weighted walks weighted walks yes I love weighted walks and that's again I think that should be the that can be the starting is it like carrying two shopping bags and walking putting the it could be that but it also just you put on a weighted vest mhm and walk that's it it's a great way of uh just getting strength training into your life without having to worry about you know form and technique and all so all the people who go walking in India and they just put a knapsack on their on their back go walking with that and say about 5 kg plate in that or 10 even lighter I mean they can start with just 2 kgs they don't have to go 5 and do their normal walk and just walk so that's weighted walk that's weighted walk that's your favorite number one that is my favorite number if there's one exercise I could do I would choose that because that helps you build muscle uh that is low impact so it's not going to hurt your joints as you get older and it is going to help you build bone mass y cult sales manager is not going to like this because everyone's going to go walking and nobody's going to turn up in C but what's your number two the thing is if more people are doing Fitness they'll still turn up in a fitness studio or better for any Fitness business in the world that's true because the same thing happened for nutrition the more people that started running and doing Fitness the more started taking care of their breakfast in the morning they turn it up for diet plans what's number two number two is uh get to the gym do squats do deadlifts uh do bench presses do pull-ups and do push-ups so these kind of things um I would really include in my in my training plan uh I mean this this list can be really long since you ask for five minuts so so so basically you're looking at you're just looking at people stimulating their muscle yeah and that's what you're looking for at the end of the day and I think for me as a nutritionist um the movements that you've just given me are predominately those wherein you say that muscle is the only age reversible organ yes and because you fast people to do this movement they're going to stimulate their muscle which is not going to grow older you know cool we had a nice session today but I can't let you go before I ask you some quick rapid fire questions what are the top Mobility exercises that one can do if they can't get to the gym okay uh Sur namashkar it just gets the entire body moving finish that off a few rounds and then don't just stop at Mobility get push-ups done get some glute Bridges done get body weight squats done and get some burpees done awesome what's your favorite postwork workout meal or meals I love my post-workout meals um so I do basic simple um oats uh cooked in water or milk um I'd have egg whites along with it and I love a v protein smoothie or a plant protein smoothie whatever uh the Smoothie would smoothie would be in with a banana some peanut butter and I love my peanut butter uh in either oats milk or water um with one or two dates awesome five habits that have helped you grow as an individual waking up early in the morning and working out first thing reading at least 10 pages a day uh the mandatory sun exposure that I do with my son spending at least doing at least one quality interaction uh with a family member or somebody I I love and following a timely sleep hygiene you know you've been training for many years are supplements crucial to getting that killer board you're having a great Fitness life I don't think so I think the most important thing would be the quantity of food and then if you have enough variety within your food as in you're eating enough sufficient vegetable you're eating sufficient protein you're also including some uh good carbohydrates Etc uh and after that when you've been into fitness for a long time is when having supplements will probably give you an edge three advices you would get into a time capsule and travel back in time and tell your younger self never let your sleep go off for a toss just make sure that sleep is topmost priority For You Second is hang out more with people who support your goals and are able to push you to be better every day and third is just travel a lot because I've learned a lot uh whenever I traveled how much ever I traveled I think it could have been a lot more than that so at culit you have Ric Roshan as a brand ambassador and you spent many many hours designing workout programs with him and he's one of the fittest Indian men that we have seen what is it like to see Rik rosan work with him and even work out with him yeah so I've I've never worked out with him I have worked with him with him on creating workout programs I would say he is humble he's intelligent he knows what he's talking about and he's deeply passionate about making Fitness accessible to this world before you go I know you have searched on that small bike through the lanes and I can always visualize you like like nice dark glasses searching for a place how did you find Ric ran okay so I've been a huge fan of Ric russan and uh so this is much before cult okay and after one of his uh Transformations I actually tweeted to him hey Ric what does your nutrition protocol look like and I had no idea that at some point I will be working with him very will get to work with him very closely I will get to create a workout program with him hrx workout that is one of the top favorites of people people at cult while I worked with him uh things that stood out for me one was he's very humble second he's very intelligent he knows what he's talking about and he's really passionate about creating an impact in the world of Fitness why so what I'm trying to say is that he could have uh delegated a lot of things um on the workout but he made sure that he spends time uh with me giving me the insights that he has learned over so many years working out and learning about his body and that was my experience with Rik rushan awesome so we have gone riding the bike Lanes uh to find your first gym to waking up and cuddling your son and getting
