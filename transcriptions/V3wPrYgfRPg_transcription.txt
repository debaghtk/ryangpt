Transcript: so today's video is about vesh fogot losing a chance at a medal and as India's senior nutritionist I would like to say that I have worked on Olympic medals and having won with the athlete a few medals there is certain experiential wisdom that is required when you eat food and compete in weight management category sports boxing Taekwondo Judo weightlifting wrestling all of these require you to be in a certain category of weight now we've heard about the news and this video is not about virality it's just me coming to you and thinking what are the problems that could have happened so this has been a systemic endemic problem not from the system not from the government not from organizations not from the support team but you know I keep saying this to people you have a coach for the sport you have a physiotherapist for the sport you have a nutritionist for the sport you have a strength and conditioning person for the sport you have all of these people masio mind coaches and everything but when you look at the elite players they travel with about 10 to 11 of their own personal team the chef the nutritionist the masio these three are actually at the bottom of the authority chain but they're the most most important when it comes to the execution of what the athlete needs to do eat sleep breathe every day the snc coach the physiotherapist and then the main coach who's the strategist who brings all of these people together now when Miss fogot lost 2 point some cages of weight gain happened after 1 million then it said in the papers that everyone panicked I have experienced stuff like this with athletes and it does happen and what could be some of the reasons one could be that I've won many fights I'm on a low calorie diet this is not my weight management category and so I saw something and I ate it now when we do genetic testing in our Clinic there's something known as a satiety Gene and a snacking Gene so I remember once somebody came to my house and I kept a bowl of pistachos and I counted the number of pistachos which was around 45 pistachos in that bowl and we were having conversation at the end of the conversation this gentleman had a snacking Jean he refused to believe that he snacks he always thought he was very very disciplined so even athletes think they're very disciplined but is the athlete carrying a wing scale one of my boxing clients is laughed at in one of the leading sporting facilities in the country because every time she goes down for breakfast she carries a small wing scale right so everyone's laughing at her scale but it's a way of life because you need to know how many calories of rice oats Corn Flakes or how many mL of milk you're drinking or what is the weight of my protein what is the weight of my carbohydrate and so the athlete needs to get aware of what they need to eat so how much to eat when to eat and what to eat now when I come back to the snacking Gene that client ate all 45 pistachos at the end of it I said sergy did you know that you ate all 45 pistachos and he gave me GES and bad words K how can you treat me like this I said sir I'm trying to prove a point to you that I've told you with a genetic test that you have a snacking Gene in your counseling with me when you're not with me 24 bar7 which is the case with the Olympic level athletes they're not with the nutritionist right they're not living with the doctor in the room they're not living with the coach in the room so the chance is that there's a slip between the mind and the lip so snacking Gene is one the second one is satiety Gene you eat something but your brain doesn't receive the signal that you have a sense of fullness so you'll say one more spoon one more spoon now I believe that the wrestlers the boxers don't do this they literally starve themselves if you see the two boxers there are some media articles saying that they did not drink water they did not eat well for 2 days just to meet the weight category so I am asking what are we doing to help the athlete and when I worked with sushil Kumar in the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics his diet plan and his supplement strategy was given months in advance so what I'm trying to say is that we are constantly recreating dress rehearsals of this weight category whenever a coach has told me we need to go into this weight Category 6 weeks later I pull my hands back and say do not do it there's an effect on the health of the athlete as you saw with the dehydration drawing off blood cutting the hair I mean Psych ically physiologically you'll do whatever it takes right but my question is is the strategy correct in the pursuit of a gold medal yes when all Stakes are high I would support any team to win a gold medal even if it's at the risk of putting the athlete at the borderline of dropping into worse Health but you know that you can pull back within a few hours after you do the way you can eat you can hydrate but coming back what could have been this 2 kgs weight gain this 2 kgs weight gain in my opinion could have been something that she ate which was loaded with sugar or salt and she was not aware of it she was either too tired or not in the level of perception see you need to understand one thing when you're on low calorie carbohydrate diet for days on end your brain will only come out with aggression in adrenal at the time of matches the rest of the time most athletes are like walking zombies because the brain shuts down so could it be that the brain had shut down and the attention to detail for food to eat something was not there so obviously the athlete is not in the full cognizant mind meaning attention is not there to the food that you're eating now do you know that if you store a higher carbohydrate food what we call is looing the glycogen in the muscle can increase anywhere from 600 to about 800 G for an athlete of Mis forgot size now one molecule of glycogen throws three molecules of water which means 800 G of glycogen will store 2.4 L of water in the muscle so a weight loss of 600 G to about 3 KGS is the range of operation that you can use just on lowering carbohydrates on the diet and going towards a high protein diet so I'm sure the nutritionist may have been astute enough to have done this now the question is was this done was there a person sitting and handing over her meals because now this is what I would do I remember in the Asia cup when I was working with the Indian hockey team um I had prepared bottles for each of the players and I remember dilip Tiki was the captain at that time and he like bab why are you putting my name on the bottle like boss I want to monitor how much you drank for the match so one of the coaches over there is like what will you come to know on how much he drunk in the match matches all sir you're not playing one match you're playing Seven matches to get to the finals so in every match that I play I am coming to know which is the guy that's got so much of stress that he's forgotten to drink water or he's forgotten how to eat or something was put in front of them and they don't remember what they ate so the cognizance of the athlete is lowered because of lack of glucose and carbohydrate due to cutting of weight the brain not working and therefore when food is going into you it's going subconsciously unconsciously and you are not aware of the scientific load of that food on your body and then you get a  Sly saying that by weight to opo gas so this could be one of the reasons the second reason plausibly could be that the menstration cycle has to be timed properly with female athletes so a lot of times we will use birth control a quarter in advance to reset the menstruation cycle because you know a woman is most powerful between the seventh day onwards after the finish of a menstruation cycle till about 21 days so we have this window where around 14 to 21 days the most power comes out of a woman most endurance comes out of a woman least amount of fatigue it's called The ovulatory Phase now we've got a chart in our Clinic which we put together the Quan clinics where I practice with a lot of sports nutritionists and we look at that as one component so could it have been that there was a hormonal glitch for her the third point which maybe a lot of people may not realize is the inducement of euphoria or stress in either one of these categories can cuse cause you to do think or behave in certain ways that will affect the pathways of biochemistry in your body so I have seen some of my athletes get very very happy and suddenly put on weight or get extremely depressed and anxiety and we don't even we can't even get the fat percentage out of the body so this could be another reason that would be there in addition to this as being a member of the doping committee sometimes athletes will keep supplements with them and they need to take the supplements that are legal which has the inform sports or the band substances group logo or informed Choice logo on it these are ratified that they don't contain ban substances and these are some of the supplements that the athletes can take sometimes what happens is when you keep these supplements and in the running between rooms and getting the arena and all of that stuff the supplements can be exposed opposed to its natural contamination which is air water and get spoiled so can the spoilage have caused something I'm not saying this happened in a case but I'm trying to identify in my head I've been bangging my head for the last two days what could be uh the reason for that and then could be what we call as professional sabotage in nutritional supplements let's so let's say for example just a case scenario um my athlete is hated by another competitor's team and they have an electrolyte solution over there but the electrolyte has no glucose in it so what you do is the sweetnesses you don't know you replace the electrolyte powder with glucose powder so what's going to happen is you prepare a 1 lit solution and it has 120 or 60 grams of glucose right and you drink it and you think it's got your sweetener which is zero calorie and electrolytes so that was another thought process that went in my head now as a sports nutritionist I'm supposed to plan for all of these contingencies I'm supposed to educate the I'm supposed to repeatedly counsel and the best case scenario is that if an athlete has his or her Chef SL nutritionist with them then the food preparation should be closely guarded literally by that person you know it's like uh when I do a lot of counseling I expect my bowl of fruit to be here on the side with me now I'm not going to decide which fruit I have to eat I'm not going to decide how to wash that fruit how to cut it to put salt or not to put salt how much quantity should I keep it over here A nutrition plan is created and given to my housekeeping and that is placed in front of me that convenience allows me to focus on my work but as an athlete if I don't have that convenience meaning if my country doesn't offer me the support of a chef if my country doesn't offer me the support of a nutritionist then I have to think about breakfast lunch dinner pre-warm up priming post priming meal pre-match meal during match and post match and there are so many permutations and combinations so when I give a nutrition plan and I'm remotely sitting in India and then the athlete is over there okay Ryan said to do this so am I not creating another level of stress so literally I used to call myself the water boy in my younger years wherein I would prepare those Solutions and keep it for the Indian hockey team and you know when they would come out at half time I like M tu tu tu tu I would put the packet of amino acids into their mouth and everything because they were just like so much in the zone and they don't have the focus and that's why you have that batminton coach that TT coach that weightlifting coach that boxing coach that wrestling coach standing on the line sideline they shouting at them so TK match why is the coach there do you think PV synu does not know how to play batminton do you think sharat Kamal doesn't know how to play table tennis do you think mirabai chanu doesn't know how to power lift and weightlift and do the necessary thing do you think Miss fogot doesn't know how to do wrestling why do they need a coach over there please ask that question they need a coach over there because that's the person that's taking them to the next level like Dal chavel Roti when you're eating food where's the coach where's the nutrition coach so I have been shouting from the Treetops before this Paris Olympics I even offered the services of mine free of cost on July 20th to all the Olympic level athletes I reached out to my ex-clients they're like yeah yeah it's okay I don't want to take names over here but you guys if you're watching this video you know who you are I offered to give my dietary support services and when I watched the Olympics I was able to see who was tired and who was not tired now you may troll me and say like how is that possible let's get on a live call let's get on a live h a program and I will pick out the players and how does that happen pick out the players who have greater energy and lower energy over the years as a good by the side of the athlete nutritionist you begin to have observational wisdom on what is low yes all of these exercise variables like whoop Garmin Apple watch have comeing has made my life much more simpler so so could we train with these on the athletes and then know how their body performs so I'm sure the teams are doing that as I'm sure the organizers are doing this but I want to make this point you need the nutritionist and the chef to be there with the athletes and so what are my solutions for India at the next Olympics in USA what I would do I would get a think tank team together give me five hours with this team and I will write you a blueprint and I'll just WR CLE it off very very quickly number one is how do we select the dietitians or nutritionists that support the Indian Olympic team number one they need to have a minimum of 10 years of experience with any athlete there needs to be a recruitment process where the government That's Sports Authority of India as well as all of the organizations including tops ogq go sports lshe when they want to hire the professionals inhouse that's the physios the nutritionist the doctors whoever is there the coaches there SE there needs to be a caliber at which you recruit a person I know a few organizations in fact I had a conversation with one of the organizations saying that why don't you allow me and my team of 100 plus Sports nutritionist to take care of your athletes instead of you hiring that person in your organization you see when you hire the organization first of all you ask for 1 to three years of experience with a nutritionist do you you think the Indian athlete who's going for an Olympic medal deserves an Olympic level experien support staff or somebody who has one to three years of experience and you wing it along the way so you have to wait for four Olympics before that nutritionist really gets good so do you have a committee to select these individuals I think you need to go with a wisdom culture experiential culture so one is the problem of who's being recruited and is it Nam V uh people that you are recruiting um so I don't want to poke holes at which nutritionist is out there or which uh Sports coaches out there that's not doing their jobs but this is something that we need to do once you identify these people you sit them down if you're going for the next Olympics we start one year in advance with Olympic probables and confirmed Olympic go-getters all of them are put on a nutrition plan each athlete is monitored by a msse or PhD nutrition student his or her dissertation depends on the qualification Mark level for this athlete now once you do this if you have a personalized nutritionist let's say one nutritionist can handle 30 athletes for the year that person's sole responsibility is these 30 athletes now you don't give One Nutrition you give two nutritionist because what if that nutritionist Falls sick or what if that physio Falls sick or Then massio Fall sick so every 30 athletes get two nutritionist and once you get this you begin to start the diet planning process based on blood test genetic test microbiome test the microbiome test is done every 90 days to see how the diet is affecting the gut microbiome the mental anxiety is even impacted by the diet the depression in the athlete is impacted by the gut health so microbiome analysis really takes you to the next level I have had who say that Dr Ryan and I'm not even a doctor I'm just a nutritionist but out of respect they say that to me what am I eating that you making me feel so good so it's a process of knowing which foods are thumbs up which foods are thumbs down have you done a food intolerance test for the Indian Olympic team you haven't done it when you say V protein do they really need to take V protein what if they allergic to Dairy so these are points that are not considered you're winging it you're winging it India is winging it Dal chavel Roti has no say in the athletes life so when I put this together I'll come into when we start traveling to those time zones look at temperature look at humidity look at hydration look at electrolytes look at five restaurants in 5 kilomet ranges hell let's carry our own I would put together 20 chefs for the next Olympics we hire an Indian restaurant if we going to Los Angeles we call up Mr vikas Kaa Chef can you arrange for 30 Indian chefs in USA we will put them on deputation over there let the whole Indian team reach their one month in advance let's pay to hire our own village let's work out over there transfer everyone into that time zone at that point when you begin to do stuff like this is only when you have an undeniable chance of winning because when you start doing this you've prepared for all contingencies and when you have your own food for example breakfast the conflicts that comes or the oats that comes or the poha that comes or the paraa that comes every ingredient on that is predetermined so I will tell my team hey guys find out the best wheat flake Brands find out the best oat brand France I want it all organic give me the nutritional profiling of these Brands I want to start one year in advance we will approve these as the food vendors I want blueberries which are the best blueberries in the world because my athlete doesn't need sadala blueberries he needs the best of the best blueberries right and we don't want to make the athlete decide these things so that is the function of us the organizations the the support staff the government and everything that's what we need to be doing and I'll tell you what's the problem the bureaucrats and the administrators are too scared so when I once worked with an organization and one of the athletes got tested dope positive because of sabotage we stopped the whole nutrition programs because we just too scared to give advice because what if the athlete test positive now I'm just trying to share with you that you will have ups and downs but that's part of life and you know the loss today I mean I was angry yesterday she lost it for 100 grams I mean and today as I reflect I think I feel for the doctor the physio the whole support team you can't plan for something like this but I asked this question were you well prepared enough with all contingencies planned out it's like going to war and I think India approaches the battlefield in sports in a very laid-back attitude from the nutrition perspective and sleep perspective so there's a lot of things that we could do and this was just a video from my heart saying that for the next Olympics I would love to offer my services to any athlete out there uh many of you think that uh I'm doing this for my own agenda the biggest agenda I have in life is to win an Olympic gold medal with the athlete you know and and I get trolled saying that where have you won the Olympic medal every athlete has a support team which includes the coaches and it is very personal because when the athlete wins have you noticed how much the coaches jump with joy because it's everyone's it's the athletes Victory it's the athletes medal but it's like parents right when I graduated my parents had the biggest smile on their face they're your biggest fans so I would love to be the biggest fan to all the Indian athletes and it'll be a pleasure for me to help everyone out in the next Olympics yes it's going to cost money but then there's an investment required for every victory in life
