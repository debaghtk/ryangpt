cium husk is a wonderful option we also give it to all my patients in us as well it comes with a brand called matam musil idea behind that is as we talked about fiber is absolutely critical for the gut in our modern days era we don't get enough fiber so we add this fiber supplements but the problem is we need to add it very slowly because all the gut all the people's every individual is different so sometimes fiber can precipitate abdominal bloating so most of the times what happens is I take as them to take celium husk they take one day and then they get bloated and they like you know this do is not good let's go to a different doctor so you should talk very very slowly sometimes you might be able to even take two to three capsules that you'll be surprised sometimes you'll be able to eat only one or even better is forget about celium mask and just take fiber through natural sources until you reach 25 G of fiber per day minimum
