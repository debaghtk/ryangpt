Title: What to Eat after Karwa Chauth Fast

Description: Karwa Chauth is a Hindu festival celebrated by married women for the well-being and longevity of their husbands. Fasting is an integral part of this festival, where women abstain from food and water from dawn to moonrise. It is essential to keep oneself hydrated and energized during the fast to avoid any discomfort or health issues.
One of the ways to crush your Karwa Chauth fast like a pro is to stay hydrated by sipping on refreshing drinks such as alkaline water infused with cucumber, lemon peel, peppermint, coriander leaves, coconut water, or tangy nembu paani.
Another tip is to go nuts about nuts! Treat yourself to pre-soaked almonds, walnuts, pistachios, or dates. Nuts are a rich source of energy and keep you full for a longer time.
You can also keep it fruity by nibbling on light fruits such as juicy pomegranates, crisp pears, or crunchy apples. Fruits are an excellent source of vitamins and minerals and provide the necessary nutrients to keep you going.
Finally, have a tummy-friendly dinner by indulging in basic, low masala, low oil ghar ka khana. It is essential to avoid heavy and spicy food that can cause discomfort and acidity during the fast.
