[0.00 - 4.56] hey everyone
[1.12 - 7.60] uh a video very quickly on performance
[4.56 - 9.92] wire nutrition now as a nutritionist i
[7.60 - 11.44] control protein carbs fats vitamins
[9.92 - 13.92] minerals water
[11.44 - 15.76] now to enhance performance in anybody
[13.92 - 18.16] from marathon runners to triathlon
[15.76 - 20.48] people we want to look at air
[18.16 - 23.20] now how do we breathe and and a lot of
[20.48 - 25.60] times when i do nutrition counseling i
[23.20 - 27.44] look at um how can i measure the lung
[25.60 - 29.44] capacity so let's talk about the lungs
[27.44 - 32.08] the lungs are two empty sacs inside your
[29.44 - 33.28] thoracic cavity at the bottom here you
[32.08 - 35.92] have
[33.28 - 38.00] you have what is called as the diaphragm
[35.92 - 42.32] right so when you breathe the diaphragm
[38.00 - 44.56] pulls down and your lungs inflate so
[42.32 - 46.80] i want to share with you uh my screen
[44.56 - 50.16] today uh and i wanted to walk you
[46.80 - 53.60] through very quickly uh how you can you
[50.16 - 55.44] can imagine your lungs are working so if
[53.60 - 58.40] you look at this over here
[55.44 - 60.88] uh your lungs they inflate
[58.40 - 62.64] right you have intercostal muscles near
[60.88 - 64.80] the side of your ribs and you have the
[62.64 - 66.40] diaphragm and the bronchioles are all of
[64.80 - 70.48] these beautiful network which go to
[66.40 - 72.48] alveoli right so if if i can just spaws
[70.48 - 75.52] it at the alveoli
[72.48 - 78.32] you have like almost huge football
[75.52 - 80.16] fields of these bronchioles if you if
[78.32 - 80.88] you spread them out and this is where
[80.16 - 83.44] the
[80.88 - 86.88] oxygen and the carbon dioxide get
[83.44 - 89.36] exchanged at these guys the alveoli
[86.88 - 91.68] now for every athlete if i want to
[89.36 - 94.16] improve performance
[91.68 - 95.68] alveoli is in touch with the blood
[94.16 - 98.40] blood i have to look at the blood
[95.68 - 101.84] biochemistry but i can also look at
[98.40 - 104.56] improving the surface area of the oxygen
[101.84 - 107.20] going into the alveoli so from this
[104.56 - 109.68] perspective what i wanted to do today is
[107.20 - 112.08] i want to show you something that i use
[109.68 - 115.36] to train the athletes on which is to
[112.08 - 117.12] check their lung capacity so um i'm
[115.36 - 118.00] going to do a quick test today of my
[117.12 - 119.60] lungs
[118.00 - 121.68] and you know you're going to join me and
[119.60 - 124.16] i'm going to explain to you how we can
[121.68 - 125.60] do the the lung test today so i hope i'm
[124.16 - 127.76] in view today
[125.60 - 130.56] uh this is me so there's a speedometer
[127.76 - 133.04] over here to check your lung test
[130.56 - 134.88] okay now over here i've got the flow
[133.04 - 136.80] which is liters per second and here's
[134.88 - 138.96] the volume now every time an athlete
[136.80 - 141.28] anytime a client comes to me
[138.96 - 144.08] i am measuring not only height weight
[141.28 - 145.68] body fat percentage blood chemistry uh
[144.08 - 147.20] but i'm also not only looking at
[145.68 - 150.32] genetics and microbiome i'm also looking
[147.20 - 152.72] at the lung function how can you measure
[150.32 - 154.24] your efficiency of breathing every time
[152.72 - 156.56] you come in obviously you go out and you
[154.24 - 158.16] train it every time but
[156.56 - 159.44] let's check my lungs today okay so i'm
[158.16 - 161.52] going to do uh
[159.44 - 165.68] inspiratory muscle training
[161.52 - 167.92] now we breathe in through our nose
[165.68 - 170.24] and exhale through our mouth so
[167.92 - 172.24] inspiration on this device is through
[170.24 - 174.08] the mouth because if you're an athlete
[172.24 - 175.52] how do you breathe
[174.08 - 177.04] a lot of time people go and they do the
[175.52 - 178.64] spirometer
[177.04 - 181.04] you blow out
[178.64 - 182.48] you don't breathe oxygen in that way so
[181.04 - 184.88] inspiratory muscle training was
[182.48 - 186.64] discovered by some scientist in uk and
[184.88 - 187.76] they said they developed a device called
[186.64 - 189.12] the power breath and the power breadth
[187.76 - 191.60] said that i can measure your lung
[189.12 - 193.60] capacity i got the device here in india
[191.60 - 196.32] i measure my athlete's lung lung
[193.60 - 199.68] capacity so this is how it works
[196.32 - 201.92] you take in rapidly you exhale slowly so
[199.68 - 206.04] let's watch this lung speedometer over
[201.92 - 206.04] here okay so here goes
[216.32 - 221.28] so you can see
[217.68 - 223.20] uh my personal best has been 21.6
[221.28 - 225.20] right and that's my flow now i want to
[223.20 - 226.96] show you when an athlete comes to me i'm
[225.20 - 229.04] looking at load i'm looking at energy
[226.96 - 230.96] i'm looking at inspirative flower watch
[229.04 - 233.20] inspiratory flow okay which is in this
[230.96 - 236.16] tangent over here okay so i'm gonna do a
[233.20 - 236.16] very low breath
[238.88 - 243.44] so i didn't i didn't inhale properly so
[240.72 - 245.04] you can see how that graph went okay
[243.44 - 247.12] now let's do this with a solid breath
[245.04 - 248.64] okay yeah power breath training is i
[247.12 - 249.92] measure 30 breaths every time the
[248.64 - 252.16] athlete comes
[249.92 - 255.16] across to me here at our clinic so let's
[252.16 - 255.16] go
[271.92 - 275.44] you can see
[273.28 - 276.64] i raised down the pressure or load of
[275.44 - 278.32] water
[276.64 - 280.72] because i got a bit of i think a
[278.32 - 282.48] background cold from last week spiral so
[280.72 - 284.88] i can feel that cold in there but you
[282.48 - 286.72] can look at a bad breath okay
[284.88 - 289.36] can you see that chuck chuck chuck right
[286.72 - 291.20] so the whole idea is now if i measure
[289.36 - 293.36] these 30 breaths okay so so far i've
[291.20 - 294.56] done only 10 on 30 breaths i will take a
[293.36 - 297.28] long time to do all the breaths but let
[294.56 - 299.36] me do a last nice breath come back to my
[297.28 - 301.20] uh basic view i don't know i don't want
[299.36 - 303.28] to show you a lot but if you look over
[301.20 - 305.04] here there's the power you can see my
[303.28 - 306.48] powers come down and this is my volume
[305.04 - 307.76] okay so i'm gonna try and go for a good
[306.48 - 311.00] power and a good volume for the next
[307.76 - 311.00] five breaths
[328.48 - 334.16] you can really see that uh post the
[331.60 - 335.84] viral last week i had a bad
[334.16 - 338.40] viral
[335.84 - 339.28] my lungs are actually still congested
[338.40 - 341.52] uh
[339.28 - 344.16] i'm not able to go even close to my 12.5
[341.52 - 346.96] my volume slow down so let's save this
[344.16 - 349.04] up and let me show you a comparison of
[346.96 - 350.88] my previous breaths
[349.04 - 353.28] um you know these are my four breaths
[350.88 - 354.96] the first day i did it and if you look
[353.28 - 357.40] over here you can see volume okay so the
[354.96 - 360.88] first time i did it can you see that
[357.40 - 363.68] 0.683 uh liters volume per breath that
[360.88 - 366.40] means each breath is 0.683 and then my
[363.68 - 367.44] peak was 2.46
[366.40 - 370.32] liters
[367.44 - 371.52] and today my average is 2.129 so let me
[370.32 - 373.44] look at today's session i'm going to
[371.52 - 375.04] double click over there you can see my
[373.44 - 376.80] different breadth so you see when i was
[375.04 - 379.84] kind of doing those erratic breaths i
[376.80 - 381.52] had a 1.347 and then i really decided to
[379.84 - 383.28] push myself
[381.52 - 386.64] i said you know what last five breaths
[383.28 - 389.44] let me go for maximum volume capacity
[386.64 - 392.96] right so 2.53 but see how it tapered out
[389.44 - 394.96] so i check athletes with uh 30 breaths
[392.96 - 396.44] per session and you can see this one
[394.96 - 399.52] session where i got
[396.44 - 401.76] 2.4336 as an average so let's say you
[399.52 - 405.36] this you meet this ryan with volume and
[401.76 - 407.12] you meet this ryan with volume
[405.36 - 408.80] you can come to know the change so
[407.12 - 410.48] ideally speaking you want your athlete
[408.80 - 412.88] to increment to their peak volume
[410.48 - 414.88] capacity average volume capacity is
[412.88 - 416.96] about six liters for elite athletes the
[414.88 - 419.68] world record is at 12.5 liters for a
[416.96 - 422.00] british rule look at my load
[419.68 - 424.24] load is the amount of volume of water i
[422.00 - 425.92] can lift so i lifted 20 centimeters of
[424.24 - 428.40] water on average today but in the
[425.92 - 430.08] previous session i did 22 centimeters
[428.40 - 433.60] and then look at my flow
[430.08 - 435.68] my flow last time was three point
[433.60 - 438.56] three point two three three and this
[435.68 - 441.92] time it is 3.282
[438.56 - 444.40] so if you look at that you know um
[441.92 - 446.24] my flow went up if you see my my load
[444.40 - 448.00] went really up and then i i lowered it
[446.24 - 449.92] down because i couldn't pull because my
[448.00 - 451.60] lungs were not feeling too good not a
[449.92 - 452.40] great day to make a video
[451.60 - 454.56] but
[452.40 - 457.04] you know what's my perspective over here
[454.56 - 459.28] my perspective is
[457.04 - 461.52] when i am looking at
[459.28 - 463.12] performance in the human individual
[461.52 - 465.68] right
[463.12 - 466.96] as a nutritionist i'm looking to enhance
[465.68 - 470.16] the diet
[466.96 - 472.48] right but diet undergoes metabolism or
[470.16 - 474.56] combustion in the human body which is
[472.48 - 476.40] the delivery of oxygen so oxygen can be
[474.56 - 478.40] delivered throughout the day doxygen can
[476.40 - 481.12] be also tracked during your sports
[478.40 - 483.04] performance so what my logic to every
[481.12 - 486.08] athlete out there is
[483.04 - 489.04] could you train your lungs
[486.08 - 490.64] stand alone without any physical
[489.04 - 491.76] activity
[490.64 - 494.32] you know it's like going to the gym and
[491.76 - 496.72] doing a bicep curl
[494.32 - 498.08] you train only the bicep
[496.72 - 499.76] but you're a tennis player you're a
[498.08 - 502.16] football player
[499.76 - 503.92] you do the power breath training to
[502.16 - 505.52] inspiratory muscle training to train
[503.92 - 507.60] your lungs with 30 breaths in the
[505.52 - 510.72] morning 30 breaths in the evening you
[507.60 - 512.96] improve the alveoli surface area so i
[510.72 - 514.80] still remember when robin did this the
[512.96 - 516.96] cricketer robinhood did this long time
[514.80 - 519.44] ago he started off at a two liter lung
[516.96 - 520.72] capacity and went on to a six liter lung
[519.44 - 522.56] capacity
[520.72 - 525.76] right so by just
[522.56 - 526.64] connecting the the the neurons of the
[525.76 - 529.04] brain
[526.64 - 530.72] uh to the diaphragm and the intercostal
[529.04 - 534.00] muscles and teaching yourself how to
[530.72 - 535.84] breathe better like i mean for example i
[534.00 - 538.24] did this after three years of covet the
[535.84 - 540.64] first time right and we did just a few
[538.24 - 542.56] breaths and i was not able to pull it in
[540.64 - 544.08] because i really had forgotten how to
[542.56 - 546.00] breathe so then i went back home every
[544.08 - 548.64] day and then i practiced it and the next
[546.00 - 551.04] time i came back i was like yeah 2.46
[548.64 - 552.48] now this is not something really great
[551.04 - 554.88] but
[552.48 - 557.36] by showing an athlete a drop or an
[554.88 - 559.28] increment in a graph you can really take
[557.36 - 561.68] the athlete to the next level for
[559.28 - 564.88] example i can even check my energy
[561.68 - 566.96] so uh i utilize 83 joules of energy in
[564.88 - 569.52] my best session
[566.96 - 571.36] but uh in my peak session uh which was
[569.52 - 572.80] the second session i actually used
[571.36 - 574.16] lesser energy because i was more
[572.80 - 578.32] efficient
[574.16 - 580.16] right so what i i'm trying to
[578.32 - 583.04] build for an athlete
[580.16 - 584.72] is the ability to monitor
[583.04 - 587.20] their output
[584.72 - 589.20] and if at a very young age
[587.20 - 590.72] at a very young age we can teach the
[589.20 - 595.84] athlete
[590.72 - 599.12] how to breathe better how to uh you know
[595.84 - 601.36] connect the brain to the breath pattern
[599.12 - 603.12] one is metabolism will get more
[601.36 - 605.36] efficient exercise will get more
[603.12 - 607.52] efficient think about it okay how do you
[605.36 - 610.88] remove lactic acid from the muscle
[607.52 - 612.00] lactic acid raises the ph in the blood
[610.88 - 614.24] and your
[612.00 - 616.64] carbon dioxide and oxygen are one of the
[614.24 - 618.96] what we call as buffer buffering systems
[616.64 - 620.64] so the more you have lactic acid the
[618.96 - 623.60] more you have to expel carbon dioxide
[620.64 - 625.28] that's how you get a lot of muscle burn
[623.60 - 627.12] your breathing right so you're throwing
[625.28 - 628.80] out carbon dioxide carbon dioxide lows
[627.12 - 632.32] down lactic acid so
[628.80 - 634.96] meat this guy breathing heavy 2.436 and
[632.32 - 637.20] meet this guy 2.12 which guy is
[634.96 - 640.00] eliminating lactic acid faster obviously
[637.20 - 641.60] this guy all right or for that matter
[640.00 - 645.76] you have a tennis player
[641.60 - 647.84] and you played a 30-40 point rally
[645.76 - 651.04] a rally of 40 rallies and you know get a
[647.84 - 653.60] point and now you're tired
[651.04 - 656.08] now meet this guy at 2.463 liter lung
[653.60 - 656.08] capacity
[656.40 - 661.36] and then meet this guy at 2.12 which guy
[658.48 - 663.04] will recover faster obviously the 2.4
[661.36 - 665.52] so the whole idea
[663.04 - 668.00] will be from a physical supremacy point
[665.52 - 670.08] of view can you identify this to the
[668.00 - 672.72] athlete and enhance their performance
[670.08 - 674.52] and from a blood chemistry point of view
[672.72 - 676.72] i know that omega-3 i know that
[674.52 - 677.52] phosphatidylserine i know that of you
[676.72 - 681.20] know
[677.52 - 681.20] brahmi i know that
[681.44 - 686.72] butterhead lettuce beetroot help in
[683.36 - 689.52] vasodilation i know that lycopene boosts
[686.72 - 692.00] lung function
[689.52 - 695.36] and this is so much out there that we
[692.00 - 697.36] can do from enhancing uh not only the
[695.36 - 699.60] physical parabens of lung breeding but
[697.36 - 701.60] also the biochemistry wherein the oxygen
[699.60 - 705.04] and the carbon dioxide exchange happen
[701.60 - 707.52] so one for performance can you get an
[705.04 - 709.68] athlete to realize that their lungs are
[707.52 - 712.40] powerful can you get the athlete to
[709.68 - 715.12] realize that i've beaten elite
[712.40 - 717.28] elite athletes on this all right because
[715.12 - 719.12] they don't know how to use their lungs
[717.28 - 721.04] and then once i show them they're like
[719.12 - 722.56] they just get it they practice 30
[721.04 - 725.52] breaths they do the inspiratory muscle
[722.56 - 726.96] training minus any exercise and many
[725.52 - 728.56] times they come back to me and they say
[726.96 - 729.84] oh you know what in the last 30 days i
[728.56 - 731.20] just did five days of power breath
[729.84 - 732.88] practice and i'm like okay come on let's
[731.20 - 734.64] check it out has your graph gone down
[732.88 - 737.44] has your graph gone up
[734.64 - 740.88] so this is me uh ryan fernando sharing
[737.44 - 742.96] snippets of my little bit of uh wisdom
[740.88 - 744.40] on how i enhance performance right from
[742.96 - 746.56] the guinness world record of non-stop
[744.40 - 747.60] aerobics to having won two olympic
[746.56 - 749.84] medals
[747.60 - 752.32] uh with olympic wrestler susheel kumar
[749.84 - 753.92] to now we're working with uh
[752.32 - 756.84] kenneth bednarek who's one of the
[753.92 - 760.48] fastest 200 meter athletes in the world
[756.84 - 762.24] performance well it's not just the food
[760.48 - 764.80] it's about what you go into the
