[2.36 - 8.10] I do know that one of my aunts had
[5.28 - 10.26] breast cancer so all my cousins in my
[8.10 - 12.66] family are being requested to be
[10.26 - 15.12] screened for bracawan and braka 2 Gene
[12.66 - 17.64] which is the breast cancer Gene we also
[15.12 - 20.22] do nutrition and health Gene testing I
[17.64 - 23.34] do significantly believe that your
[20.22 - 25.32] genetics give you a certain risk a
[23.34 - 28.38] simple explanation would be
[25.32 - 29.94] your genes are like a gun your lifestyle
[28.38 - 32.52] is like a bullet
[29.94 - 35.22] you put the bullet in the gun and then
[32.52 - 37.92] you pull the trigger the trigger is your
[35.22 - 40.20] behavior so a lot of times you may have
[37.92 - 42.78] the gene which is the gun but if your
[40.20 - 46.14] lifestyle is correct then it will not
[42.78 - 49.86] affect you in any way so it's going to
[46.14 - 52.88] be how you base your nutrition on if you
[49.86 - 52.88] have a high risk of cancer
