[1.55 - 6.18] hi my name is Ryan Fernando I'm a sports
[4.50 - 8.40] nutritionist performance nutrition
[6.18 - 10.53] expert I've helped athletes win two
[8.40 - 12.72] Olympic medals a Guinness world record
[10.53 - 14.55] of non-stop aerobics thousands of
[12.72 - 18.36] athletes that win medals day in and day
[14.55 - 20.85] out corporate CEOs executives who really
[18.36 - 22.89] you know work 18 hours a day and want
[20.85 - 25.05] everything out of their body and you are
[22.89 - 27.24] in my bedroom today for a little secret
[25.05 - 29.34] not only in terms of bedroom performance
[27.24 - 31.92] but what we need to understand is as a
[29.34 - 34.68] nutritionist protein carbs fats vitamins
[31.92 - 37.44] minerals water are things that I can
[34.68 - 41.13] enhance nutritionally but what about
[37.44 - 44.34] sleep for me sleep represents the number
[41.13 - 46.59] one philosophy for recovery I've used
[44.34 - 49.49] chamomile tea I've used melatonin I've
[46.59 - 52.92] used walnuts I've used banana I've used
[49.49 - 55.50] so many other nutritional aids
[52.92 - 57.93] ergo genic aids that help people get
[55.50 - 60.03] into deeper sleep get into REM cycle
[57.93 - 62.70] which is the rapid eye movement but
[60.03 - 65.42] about six months ago I came across pea
[62.70 - 68.13] EMF device which is fluctuating
[65.42 - 71.88] electromagnetic fields which are driven
[68.13 - 73.56] by a pulsating electricity and I was
[71.88 - 77.25] introduced to something when I was doing
[73.56 - 79.26] my research called the earth pulse so
[77.25 - 80.97] what is this earth pulse so it's for
[79.26 - 83.34] pretty excited to get one of the unit's
[80.97 - 85.44] down from the US spoke to the scientists
[83.34 - 88.74] over there and the earth pulse is
[85.44 - 92.19] nothing but two magnets that are charged
[88.74 - 95.97] by a computer now what this does is this
[92.19 - 99.18] enhances the magnetic field around your
[95.97 - 101.31] body when you sleep remember the last
[99.18 - 103.50] time you went camping you slept on the
[101.31 - 106.49] ground you slept on the earth well the
[103.50 - 109.86] earth has its own magnetic rotation this
[106.49 - 112.20] gives every animal and human on the
[109.86 - 114.84] planet its recovery because you sleep
[112.20 - 117.15] closer to the earth and the vibration of
[114.84 - 120.12] the magnetic field the resonance of it
[117.15 - 123.00] actually helps in your cellular recovery
[120.12 - 124.62] so we live in high-rise buildings we
[123.00 - 127.29] don't sleep on the ground anymore
[124.62 - 128.94] and when sleep is disturbed with our
[127.29 - 131.55] mobile phone sleep is disturbed with
[128.94 - 132.78] Wi-Fi and sleep is disturbed in athletes
[131.55 - 135.54] when we travel
[132.78 - 138.36] so how do I ensure that I can press the
[135.54 - 140.70] accelerator for that six or seven hours
[138.36 - 144.03] eight hours of sleep and try and back
[140.70 - 146.55] into that voluptuous bang in terms of
[144.03 - 148.65] all the possible energy towards recovery
[146.55 - 151.29] so the earth pulse over here
[148.65 - 153.63] is is the device it's a small nice
[151.29 - 156.12] computer that you get it costs about
[153.63 - 157.89] anywhere from about six ninety nine
[156.12 - 160.11] dollars to about fourteen hundred
[157.89 - 161.79] dollars so the unit I have over here I
[160.11 - 163.80] went and bought the professional one
[161.79 - 165.66] which is really good and I've been
[163.80 - 168.42] sleeping on it for the last six months
[165.66 - 170.61] and brilliant sleep I do sometimes for
[168.42 - 172.86] hours and I put the magnets at hundred
[170.61 - 174.45] percent of recovery I sometimes sleep
[172.86 - 176.67] for eight hours and put the magnets at
[174.45 - 178.95] forty percent recovery and I varied that
[176.67 - 180.75] the first few days that I used it I had
[178.95 - 182.64] vivid dreams and you know I always
[180.75 - 184.35] thought that if you don't dream you have
[182.64 - 186.36] good sleep but then I did my research
[184.35 - 188.85] and I found out you have to dream
[186.36 - 191.40] because when you dream you go into a
[188.85 - 193.26] deep sleep and when you get into deep
[191.40 - 196.98] sleep your body releases the necessary
[193.26 - 198.72] hormones for recovery so if you're not
[196.98 - 201.36] dreaming you got to think about that
[198.72 - 203.70] okay so for me the earth pulse is highly
[201.36 - 206.10] recommended to every athlete because I'm
[203.70 - 208.08] just gonna get a new dimension towards
[206.10 - 211.83] your recovery and not only do I have
[208.08 - 213.87] recovery I also have ability to promote
[211.83 - 215.58] alertness so sometimes what happens I
[213.87 - 217.83] come home in the afternoon from the
[215.58 - 220.56] nutrition clinic and I want to work
[217.83 - 224.79] again so I take a half an hour nap but I
[220.56 - 228.42] am the machine to the what we call as
[224.79 - 230.25] the alert mode and then I punch that in
[228.42 - 232.14] and once a punch that in I put the
[230.25 - 234.39] magnets at what intensity I want and
[232.14 - 236.67] it's actually here you know under my
[234.39 - 239.67] mattress so I'm just gonna show this
[236.67 - 241.56] across to you the two man are two
[239.67 - 243.87] magnets placed once placed over here for
[241.56 - 246.57] my lower body and once placed over here
[243.87 - 249.06] at my head so basically these magnets
[246.57 - 251.91] will radiate the pulsating frequency
[249.06 - 253.74] which affects the mitochondria in my
[251.91 - 255.69] body now when this affects my
[253.74 - 258.45] mitochondria they're going to get into
[255.69 - 260.49] that deep sleep zone or the deep alert
[258.45 - 262.92] zone whatever your programming into them
[260.49 - 264.40] into the magnets so I'm just gonna get
[262.92 - 268.45] one of the magnets
[264.40 - 270.70] from under here so this one is a
[268.45 - 272.77] computer okay which coordinates is
[270.70 - 274.66] magnet now you you you're seeing this
[272.77 - 277.81] but this is quite heavy this is a good
[274.66 - 280.09] 1kg not one case about 500 to 800 grams
[277.81 - 283.00] of weight and this actually has a
[280.09 - 284.83] shielding on it which basically if you
[283.00 - 286.48] can see it over here in the camera this
[284.83 - 290.59] shielding directs the magnetic waves
[286.48 - 293.80] upwards so basically what I can do is if
[290.59 - 296.74] I want the magnet radiation to spread
[293.80 - 299.71] all over I remove the casing and the
[296.74 - 301.45] magnetic rays go flat surface but if I
[299.71 - 304.09] want to focus the attention
[301.45 - 308.77] I put the rings on so normally what I do
[304.09 - 310.93] is I leave these on in terms of because
[308.77 - 314.35] it's under a 6 foot mattress it's
[310.93 - 317.38] radiating upwards to my body I love the
[314.35 - 320.92] device I made this video for for
[317.38 - 323.29] basically for you to figure it out do
[320.92 - 327.01] your own research I'm going to put a lot
[323.29 - 329.38] more research in in my website in my
[327.01 - 331.54] newsletter to you and if you like it
[329.38 - 333.73] there will be a link click it I must in
[331.54 - 336.25] public interest in declaration say that
[333.73 - 338.11] I have contacted the company and said
[336.25 - 340.39] that I would like to promote this
[338.11 - 342.46] product in India for all the Indian
[340.39 - 345.01] athletes so there is an affiliate fee
[342.46 - 348.43] that I do receive what you will get is a
[345.01 - 350.32] 10 percent cash back to you when you
[348.43 - 352.51] give a positive review to the company in
[350.32 - 353.80] America so in the fair interest of
[352.51 - 355.93] everything I'm giving you a public
[353.80 - 358.60] declaration but I have been using this
[355.93 - 361.51] device for six months I love it and in
[358.60 - 363.46] fact it's so good I'm thinking of
[361.51 - 365.32] getting one for my wife who sleeps on
[363.46 - 367.81] the other side of the bed because
[365.32 - 369.82] whenever she whenever I'm traveling and
[367.81 - 371.83] she sleeps on the side of the bed she
[369.82 - 374.67] says I get very very good sleep oh by
[371.83 - 377.23] the way this unit is so portable
[374.67 - 379.33] athletes can actually travel with it ok
[377.23 - 381.31] so there's a lovely if a box comes that
[379.33 - 383.92] comes like this where your computer goes
[381.31 - 387.91] in and your magnets go in and it's all
[383.92 - 391.00] of about 1.25 or 1.3 cages comes in all
[387.91 - 392.48] of that and the best part when I was
[391.00 - 394.55] talking about the
[392.48 - 397.01] as to the scientist he said that the
[394.55 - 399.80] wiring that is used has got a special
[397.01 - 402.80] shielding to prevent against EMF
[399.80 - 405.26] radiation so if you have an EMF reader
[402.80 - 408.35] and you put it next to these devices
[405.26 - 411.11] even the electrical devices that join
[408.35 - 413.78] this do not create the EMF in my entire
[411.11 - 414.83] bedroom there are no wires there are no
[413.78 - 416.84] mobile chargers
[414.83 - 418.85] there's no music desk there's no
[416.84 - 422.06] electronic alarm clock no radio no
[418.85 - 424.61] nothing because you need to sleep deep
[422.06 - 426.56] the only device that I do have and this
[424.61 - 429.59] is another tip for everyone out there is
[426.56 - 432.29] I have a humidifier meter and a
[429.59 - 435.29] temperature meter so what I do is I keep
[432.29 - 437.51] the temperature at 24 degrees Celsius 23
[435.29 - 440.96] to 24 degrees Celsius and I keep the
[437.51 - 442.94] humidity when sleeping at night at 50 to
[440.96 - 446.03] 60 degrees I have a humidifier in my
[442.94 - 448.64] room these components the magnet the
[446.03 - 451.37] temperature and the humidity creates the
[448.64 - 453.68] perfect ambience for perfect sleep and
[451.37 - 456.02] that perfect sleep it's gets you
[453.68 - 459.02] enhanced recovery now enhanced recovery
[456.02 - 461.84] in my book as Ryan Fernando helps you
[459.02 - 464.60] win a medal helps you lead your company
[461.84 - 466.61] as a CEO helps you lead your life in
[464.60 - 468.50] terms of being a champion so if you want
[466.61 - 470.60] more details click on the links below
[468.50 - 473.63] how you could buy this if you want more
[470.60 - 475.25] details you could contact me and I'll be
[473.63 - 477.32] listing my phone number over you of how
[475.25 - 478.88] you can get this device or whether you
[477.32 - 481.75] feel that you know you're in doubt
[478.88 - 484.67] because it's a sizeable investment and
[481.75 - 486.14] should you be going for it at the end of
[484.67 - 489.68] the day I've been using enough for a
[486.14 - 492.95] solid six months and there's no way I
[489.68 - 494.63] could give up with this experiments on
[492.95 - 496.97] the internet I've actually shown people
[494.63 - 498.14] using this on their racehorses so
[496.97 - 501.44] they're spending more money on
[498.14 - 503.42] racehorses with the earth pulse ten on
[501.44 - 506.84] humans so that's food for thought and
[503.42 - 509.72] speaking of food I think it's in Spain
[506.84 - 512.21] that tomato growers and greenhouse
[509.72 - 515.39] growers are actually using the earth
[512.21 - 518.78] pulse devices India greenhouses to
[515.39 - 521.09] increase the growth rate of the plants
[518.78 - 523.40] because it mimics the Earth's recovery
[521.09 - 525.35] in terms of the magnetic radiation
[523.40 - 525.56] because everywhere in the world is so
[525.35 - 526.67] much
[525.56 - 528.83] of cellular radiation so
[526.67 - 530.99] food-for-thought excellent recovery
