[0.24 - 9.08] so today's video is about vesh
[4.88 - 12.08] fogot losing a chance at a medal and as
[9.08 - 14.56] India's senior nutritionist I would like
[12.08 - 17.56] to say that I have worked on Olympic
[14.56 - 20.40] medals and having won with the athlete a
[17.56 - 23.20] few medals there is certain experiential
[20.40 - 26.48] wisdom that is required when you eat
[23.20 - 31.44] food and compete in weight management
[26.48 - 34.92] category sports boxing Taekwondo Judo
[31.44 - 37.32] weightlifting wrestling all of these
[34.92 - 39.32] require you to be in a certain category
[37.32 - 42.08] of weight
[39.32 - 45.64] now we've heard about the news and this
[42.08 - 47.84] video is not about virality it's just me
[45.64 - 49.88] coming to you and thinking what are the
[47.84 - 52.24] problems that could have happened so
[49.88 - 54.52] this has been a systemic endemic problem
[52.24 - 56.48] not from the system not from the
[54.52 - 60.00] government not from organizations not
[56.48 - 61.64] from the support team but you know I
[60.00 - 65.20] keep saying this to people you have a
[61.64 - 67.48] coach for the sport you have a
[65.20 - 69.12] physiotherapist for the sport you have a
[67.48 - 70.88] nutritionist for the sport you have a
[69.12 - 73.04] strength and conditioning person for the
[70.88 - 75.72] sport you have all of these people masio
[73.04 - 78.64] mind coaches and everything but when you
[75.72 - 80.84] look at the elite players they travel
[78.64 - 84.56] with about 10 to 11 of their own
[80.84 - 86.92] personal team the chef the nutritionist
[84.56 - 89.48] the masio these three are actually at
[86.92 - 91.08] the bottom of the authority chain but
[89.48 - 93.12] they're the most most important when it
[91.08 - 95.40] comes to the execution of what the
[93.12 - 97.64] athlete needs to do eat sleep breathe
[95.40 - 99.72] every day the snc coach the
[97.64 - 101.68] physiotherapist and then the main coach
[99.72 - 104.16] who's the strategist who brings all of
[101.68 - 107.48] these people together now when Miss
[104.16 - 109.52] fogot lost 2 point some cages of weight
[107.48 - 111.16] gain happened after 1 million then it
[109.52 - 114.32] said in the papers that everyone
[111.16 - 117.72] panicked I have experienced stuff like
[114.32 - 120.28] this with athletes and it does happen
[117.72 - 124.20] and what could be some of the reasons
[120.28 - 126.76] one could be that I've won many fights
[124.20 - 130.16] I'm on a low calorie diet this is not my
[126.76 - 133.48] weight management category and so I saw
[130.16 - 135.60] something and I ate it now when we do
[133.48 - 138.20] genetic testing in our Clinic there's
[135.60 - 141.00] something known as a satiety Gene and a
[138.20 - 143.04] snacking Gene so I remember once
[141.00 - 145.24] somebody came to my house and I kept a
[143.04 - 148.12] bowl of pistachos and I counted the
[145.24 - 149.52] number of pistachos which was around 45
[148.12 - 151.64] pistachos in that bowl and we were
[149.52 - 153.28] having conversation at the end of the
[151.64 - 155.52] conversation this gentleman had a
[153.28 - 157.96] snacking Jean he refused to believe that
[155.52 - 160.12] he snacks he always thought he was very
[157.96 - 163.12] very disciplined so even athletes think
[160.12 - 166.20] they're very disciplined but is the
[163.12 - 170.16] athlete carrying a wing scale one of my
[166.20 - 171.84] boxing clients is laughed at in one of
[170.16 - 173.76] the leading sporting facilities in the
[171.84 - 176.32] country because every time she goes down
[173.76 - 178.56] for breakfast she carries a small wing
[176.32 - 180.60] scale right so everyone's laughing at
[178.56 - 183.16] her
[180.60 - 185.16] scale but it's a way of life because you
[183.16 - 187.96] need to know how many calories of rice
[185.16 - 189.96] oats Corn Flakes or how many mL of milk
[187.96 - 191.72] you're drinking or what is the weight of
[189.96 - 194.04] my protein what is the weight of my
[191.72 - 197.28] carbohydrate and so the athlete needs to
[194.04 - 200.04] get aware of what they need to eat so
[197.28 - 202.76] how much to eat when to eat and what to
[200.04 - 206.68] eat now when I come back to the snacking
[202.76 - 209.36] Gene that client ate all 45 pistachos at
[206.68 - 211.32] the end of it I said sergy did you know
[209.36 - 214.36] that you ate all 45 pistachos and he
[211.32 - 216.16] gave me GES and bad words K how can you
[214.36 - 218.44] treat me like this I said sir I'm trying
[216.16 - 219.92] to prove a point to you that I've told
[218.44 - 222.20] you with a genetic test that you have a
[219.92 - 224.60] snacking Gene in your counseling with me
[222.20 - 226.20] when you're not with me 24 bar7 which is
[224.60 - 227.96] the case with the Olympic level athletes
[226.20 - 229.36] they're not with the nutritionist right
[227.96 - 230.40] they're not living with the doctor in
[229.36 - 232.68] the room they're not living with the
[230.40 - 235.20] coach in the room so the chance is that
[232.68 - 238.32] there's a slip between the mind and the
[235.20 - 241.48] lip so snacking Gene is one the second
[238.32 - 243.12] one is satiety Gene you eat something
[241.48 - 245.20] but your brain doesn't receive the
[243.12 - 246.92] signal that you have a sense of fullness
[245.20 - 249.00] so you'll say one more spoon one more
[246.92 - 250.68] spoon now I believe that the wrestlers
[249.00 - 253.16] the boxers don't do this they literally
[250.68 - 255.80] starve themselves if you see the two
[253.16 - 257.52] boxers there are some media articles
[255.80 - 259.88] saying that they did not drink water
[257.52 - 263.40] they did not eat well for 2 days just to
[259.88 - 267.52] meet the weight category so I am asking
[263.40 - 269.44] what are we doing to help the athlete
[267.52 - 271.32] and when I worked with sushil Kumar in
[269.44 - 273.40] the Beijing Olympics and the London
[271.32 - 276.28] Olympics his diet plan and his
[273.40 - 278.88] supplement strategy was given months in
[276.28 - 281.96] advance so what I'm trying to say is
[278.88 - 284.64] that we are constantly recreating dress
[281.96 - 286.28] rehearsals of this weight category
[284.64 - 287.92] whenever a coach has told me we need to
[286.28 - 290.88] go into this weight Category 6 weeks
[287.92 - 292.64] later I pull my hands back and say do
[290.88 - 294.88] not do it there's an effect on the
[292.64 - 297.36] health of the athlete as you saw with
[294.88 - 300.56] the dehydration drawing off blood
[297.36 - 302.80] cutting the hair I mean Psych ically
[300.56 - 306.76] physiologically you'll do whatever it
[302.80 - 308.84] takes right but my question is is the
[306.76 - 312.24] strategy correct in the pursuit of a
[308.84 - 314.48] gold medal yes when all Stakes are high
[312.24 - 316.60] I would support any team to win a gold
[314.48 - 320.04] medal even if it's at the risk of
[316.60 - 323.40] putting the athlete at the borderline of
[320.04 - 325.04] dropping into worse Health but you know
[323.40 - 327.00] that you can pull back within a few
[325.04 - 330.20] hours after you do the way you can eat
[327.00 - 332.00] you can hydrate but coming back what
[330.20 - 334.40] could have been this 2 kgs weight gain
[332.00 - 336.92] this 2 kgs weight gain in my opinion
[334.40 - 339.68] could have been something that she ate
[336.92 - 342.04] which was loaded with sugar or salt and
[339.68 - 345.84] she was not aware of it she was either
[342.04 - 347.52] too tired or not in the level of
[345.84 - 350.32] perception see you need to understand
[347.52 - 354.24] one thing when you're on low calorie
[350.32 - 357.28] carbohydrate diet for days on end your
[354.24 - 360.12] brain will only come out with aggression
[357.28 - 362.88] in adrenal at the time of matches the
[360.12 - 365.36] rest of the time most athletes are like
[362.88 - 368.00] walking zombies because the brain shuts
[365.36 - 371.52] down so could it be that the brain had
[368.00 - 376.16] shut down and the attention to detail
[371.52 - 379.08] for food to eat something was not there
[376.16 - 382.28] so obviously the athlete is not in the
[379.08 - 384.44] full cognizant mind meaning attention is
[382.28 - 387.68] not there to the food that you're eating
[384.44 - 389.80] now do you know that if you store a
[387.68 - 392.64] higher carbohydrate food what we call is
[389.80 - 396.08] looing the glycogen in the muscle can
[392.64 - 399.80] increase anywhere from 600 to about 800
[396.08 - 403.04] G for an athlete of Mis forgot
[399.80 - 405.88] size now one molecule of glycogen throws
[403.04 - 409.28] three molecules of water which means 800
[405.88 - 414.24] G of glycogen will store 2.4 L of water
[409.28 - 417.68] in the muscle so a weight loss of 600 G
[414.24 - 419.72] to about 3 KGS is the range of operation
[417.68 - 421.20] that you can use just on lowering
[419.72 - 424.32] carbohydrates on the diet and going
[421.20 - 426.04] towards a high protein diet so I'm sure
[424.32 - 427.96] the nutritionist may have been astute
[426.04 - 431.32] enough to have done this now the
[427.96 - 433.20] question is was this done was there a
[431.32 - 436.32] person sitting and handing over her
[433.20 - 439.00] meals because now this is what I would
[436.32 - 442.00] do I remember in the Asia cup when I was
[439.00 - 444.56] working with the Indian hockey team um I
[442.00 - 446.16] had prepared bottles for each of the
[444.56 - 448.92] players and I remember dilip Tiki was
[446.16 - 451.32] the captain at that time and he like bab
[448.92 - 454.32] why are you putting my name on the
[451.32 - 456.36] bottle like boss I want to monitor how
[454.32 - 458.96] much you drank for the
[456.36 - 461.24] match so one of the coaches over there
[458.96 - 462.92] is like what will you come to know on
[461.24 - 464.84] how much he drunk in the match matches
[462.92 - 466.76] all sir you're not playing one match
[464.84 - 467.56] you're playing Seven matches to get to
[466.76 - 471.28] the
[467.56 - 473.20] finals so in every match that I play I
[471.28 - 475.76] am coming to know which is the guy
[473.20 - 477.64] that's got so much of stress that he's
[475.76 - 479.68] forgotten to drink water or he's
[477.64 - 481.16] forgotten how to eat or something was
[479.68 - 482.76] put in front of them and they don't
[481.16 - 486.92] remember what they
[482.76 - 489.64] ate so the cognizance of the athlete is
[486.92 - 492.20] lowered because of lack of glucose and
[489.64 - 494.28] carbohydrate due to cutting of weight
[492.20 - 496.00] the brain not working and therefore when
[494.28 - 498.64] food is going into you it's going
[496.00 - 501.24] subconsciously unconsciously and you are
[498.64 - 503.64] not aware of the scientific load of that
[501.24 - 506.48] food on your body and then you get a
[503.64 - 509.08]  Sly saying that by weight to opo
[506.48 - 511.56] gas so this could be one of the reasons
[509.08 - 514.96] the second reason plausibly could be
[511.56 - 517.72] that the menstration cycle has to be
[514.96 - 520.72] timed properly with female athletes so a
[517.72 - 522.92] lot of times we will use birth control a
[520.72 - 525.04] quarter in advance to reset the
[522.92 - 528.56] menstruation cycle because you know a
[525.04 - 531.16] woman is most powerful between the
[528.56 - 535.48] seventh day onwards after the finish of
[531.16 - 538.24] a menstruation cycle till about 21 days
[535.48 - 541.40] so we have this window where around 14
[538.24 - 543.20] to 21 days the most power comes out of a
[541.40 - 545.12] woman most endurance comes out of a
[543.20 - 547.72] woman least amount of fatigue it's
[545.12 - 549.24] called The ovulatory Phase now we've got
[547.72 - 550.64] a chart in our Clinic which we put
[549.24 - 551.84] together the Quan clinics where I
[550.64 - 553.72] practice with a lot of sports
[551.84 - 555.88] nutritionists and we look at that as one
[553.72 - 558.96] component so could it have been that
[555.88 - 561.32] there was a hormonal glitch for her the
[558.96 - 564.56] third point which maybe a lot of people
[561.32 - 567.92] may not realize is the inducement of
[564.56 - 570.76] euphoria or stress in either one of
[567.92 - 574.08] these categories can cuse cause you to
[570.76 - 576.56] do think or behave in certain ways that
[574.08 - 579.04] will affect the pathways of biochemistry
[576.56 - 581.44] in your body so I have seen some of my
[579.04 - 583.96] athletes get very very happy and
[581.44 - 586.12] suddenly put on weight or get extremely
[583.96 - 588.12] depressed and anxiety and we don't even
[586.12 - 591.24] we can't even get the fat percentage out
[588.12 - 593.72] of the body so this could be another
[591.24 - 597.28] reason that would be there in addition
[593.72 - 600.24] to this as being a member of the doping
[597.28 - 602.32] committee sometimes athletes will keep
[600.24 - 604.40] supplements with them and they need to
[602.32 - 606.88] take the supplements that are legal
[604.40 - 610.32] which has the inform sports or the band
[606.88 - 612.48] substances group logo or informed Choice
[610.32 - 614.64] logo on it these are ratified that they
[612.48 - 615.88] don't contain ban substances and these
[614.64 - 619.48] are some of the supplements that the
[615.88 - 622.16] athletes can take sometimes what happens
[619.48 - 625.04] is when you keep these supplements and
[622.16 - 627.56] in the running between rooms and getting
[625.04 - 629.72] the arena and all of that stuff the
[627.56 - 631.96] supplements can be exposed opposed to
[629.72 - 634.24] its natural contamination which is air
[631.96 - 636.56] water and get spoiled so can the
[634.24 - 638.32] spoilage have caused something I'm not
[636.56 - 640.92] saying this happened in a case but I'm
[638.32 - 643.16] trying to identify in my head I've been
[640.92 - 646.92] bangging my head for the last two days
[643.16 - 648.80] what could be uh the reason for that and
[646.92 - 651.40] then could be what we call as
[648.80 - 652.92] professional sabotage in nutritional
[651.40 - 656.32] supplements let's so let's say for
[652.92 - 658.80] example just a case scenario um my
[656.32 - 659.92] athlete is hated by another competitor's
[658.80 - 661.60] team
[659.92 - 662.84] and they have an electrolyte solution
[661.60 - 665.48] over there but the electrolyte has no
[662.84 - 667.48] glucose in it so what you do is the
[665.48 - 669.72] sweetnesses you don't know you replace
[667.48 - 672.00] the electrolyte powder with glucose
[669.72 - 674.92] powder so what's going to happen is you
[672.00 - 677.64] prepare a 1 lit solution and it has 120
[674.92 - 678.88] or 60 grams of glucose right and you
[677.64 - 680.48] drink it and you think it's got your
[678.88 - 682.40] sweetener which is zero calorie and
[680.48 - 685.20] electrolytes so that was another thought
[682.40 - 687.76] process that went in my head now as a
[685.20 - 689.56] sports nutritionist I'm supposed to plan
[687.76 - 691.96] for all of these contingencies I'm
[689.56 - 694.28] supposed to educate the I'm supposed to
[691.96 - 698.60] repeatedly counsel and the best case
[694.28 - 702.20] scenario is that if an athlete has his
[698.60 - 704.44] or her Chef SL nutritionist with them
[702.20 - 708.56] then the food preparation should be
[704.44 - 710.96] closely guarded literally by that person
[708.56 - 713.28] you know it's like uh when I do a lot of
[710.96 - 716.00] counseling I expect my bowl of fruit to
[713.28 - 718.20] be here on the side with me now I'm not
[716.00 - 720.64] going to decide which fruit I have to
[718.20 - 723.16] eat I'm not going to decide how to wash
[720.64 - 725.08] that fruit how to cut it to put salt or
[723.16 - 727.76] not to put salt how much quantity should
[725.08 - 730.16] I keep it over here A nutrition plan is
[727.76 - 732.36] created and given to my housekeeping and
[730.16 - 734.76] that is placed in front of me that
[732.36 - 737.52] convenience allows me to focus on my
[734.76 - 740.40] work but as an athlete if I don't have
[737.52 - 742.96] that convenience meaning if my country
[740.40 - 744.68] doesn't offer me the support of a chef
[742.96 - 747.48] if my country doesn't offer me the
[744.68 - 750.92] support of a nutritionist then I have to
[747.48 - 755.12] think about breakfast lunch dinner
[750.92 - 758.00] pre-warm up priming post priming meal
[755.12 - 759.84] pre-match meal during match and post
[758.00 - 762.48] match and there are so many permutations
[759.84 - 764.12] and combinations so when I give a
[762.48 - 766.24] nutrition plan and I'm remotely sitting
[764.12 - 769.48] in India and then the athlete is over
[766.24 - 772.64] there okay Ryan said to do this so am I
[769.48 - 774.36] not creating another level of stress so
[772.64 - 777.04] literally I used to call myself the
[774.36 - 778.84] water boy in my younger years wherein I
[777.04 - 781.92] would prepare those Solutions and keep
[778.84 - 783.08] it for the Indian hockey team and you
[781.92 - 785.52] know when they would come out at half
[783.08 - 787.16] time I like M tu tu tu tu I would put
[785.52 - 788.84] the packet of amino acids into their
[787.16 - 792.08] mouth and everything because they were
[788.84 - 795.68] just like so much in the zone and they
[792.08 - 798.56] don't have the focus and that's why you
[795.68 - 800.56] have that batminton coach that TT coach
[798.56 - 802.36] that weightlifting coach that boxing
[800.56 - 804.28] coach that wrestling coach standing on
[802.36 - 807.16] the line
[804.28 - 810.44] sideline they shouting at them so TK
[807.16 - 812.04] match why is the coach there
[810.44 - 813.96] do you think PV synu does not know how
[812.04 - 815.28] to play batminton do you think sharat
[813.96 - 817.72] Kamal doesn't know how to play table
[815.28 - 818.84] tennis do you think mirabai chanu
[817.72 - 821.00] doesn't know how to power lift and
[818.84 - 822.64] weightlift and do the necessary thing do
[821.00 - 824.52] you think Miss fogot doesn't know how to
[822.64 - 826.48] do wrestling why do they need a coach
[824.52 - 828.12] over there please ask that question they
[826.48 - 830.04] need a coach over there because that's
[828.12 - 832.52] the person that's taking them to the
[830.04 - 833.96] next level like Dal chavel Roti when
[832.52 - 836.36] you're eating
[833.96 - 839.88] food where's the coach where's the
[836.36 - 842.24] nutrition coach so I have been shouting
[839.88 - 845.44] from the Treetops before this Paris
[842.24 - 849.72] Olympics I even offered the services of
[845.44 - 851.64] mine free of cost on July 20th to all
[849.72 - 853.96] the Olympic level athletes I reached out
[851.64 - 855.96] to my ex-clients they're like yeah yeah
[853.96 - 857.48] it's okay I don't want to take names
[855.96 - 859.72] over here but you guys if you're
[857.48 - 861.80] watching this video you know who you are
[859.72 - 864.60] I offered to give my dietary support
[861.80 - 866.84] services and when I watched the Olympics
[864.60 - 868.36] I was able to see who was tired and who
[866.84 - 869.60] was not tired now you may troll me and
[868.36 - 872.44] say like how is that
[869.60 - 874.76] possible let's get on a live call let's
[872.44 - 876.56] get on a live h a program and I will
[874.76 - 878.60] pick out the players and how does that
[876.56 - 881.60] happen pick out the players who have
[878.60 - 885.32] greater energy and lower energy over the
[881.60 - 887.68] years as a good by the side of the
[885.32 - 891.68] athlete nutritionist you begin to have
[887.68 - 893.44] observational wisdom on what is low yes
[891.68 - 896.16] all of these exercise variables like
[893.44 - 899.48] whoop Garmin Apple watch have comeing
[896.16 - 901.08] has made my life much more simpler so so
[899.48 - 902.64] could we train with these on the
[901.08 - 904.60] athletes and then know how their body
[902.64 - 906.16] performs so I'm sure the teams are doing
[904.60 - 910.52] that as I'm sure the organizers are
[906.16 - 912.84] doing this but I want to make this point
[910.52 - 915.08] you need the nutritionist and the chef
[912.84 - 919.04] to be there with the athletes and so
[915.08 - 922.32] what are my solutions for India at the
[919.04 - 925.00] next Olympics in USA what I would do I
[922.32 - 927.08] would get a think tank team together
[925.00 - 928.76] give me five hours with this team and I
[927.08 - 931.52] will write you a blueprint and I'll just
[928.76 - 933.92] WR CLE it off very very quickly number
[931.52 - 935.80] one is how do we select the dietitians
[933.92 - 937.80] or nutritionists that support the Indian
[935.80 - 940.52] Olympic team number one they need to
[937.80 - 943.56] have a minimum of 10 years of experience
[940.52 - 946.08] with any athlete there needs to be a
[943.56 - 948.80] recruitment process where the government
[946.08 - 951.08] That's Sports Authority of India as well
[948.80 - 955.80] as all of the organizations including
[951.08 - 958.56] tops ogq go sports lshe when they want
[955.80 - 961.12] to hire the professionals inhouse that's
[958.56 - 963.84] the physios the nutritionist the doctors
[961.12 - 966.24] whoever is there the coaches there SE
[963.84 - 968.84] there needs to be a caliber at which you
[966.24 - 970.72] recruit a person I know a few
[968.84 - 971.84] organizations in fact I had a
[970.72 - 974.44] conversation with one of the
[971.84 - 977.36] organizations saying that why don't you
[974.44 - 979.76] allow me and my team of 100 plus Sports
[977.36 - 981.60] nutritionist to take care of your
[979.76 - 984.00] athletes instead of you hiring that
[981.60 - 985.52] person in your organization you see when
[984.00 - 986.84] you hire the organization first of all
[985.52 - 988.96] you ask for 1 to three years of
[986.84 - 992.00] experience with a nutritionist do you
[988.96 - 995.52] you think the Indian athlete who's going
[992.00 - 999.32] for an Olympic medal deserves an Olympic
[995.52 - 1000.80] level experien support staff or somebody
[999.32 - 1002.52] who has one to three years of experience
[1000.80 - 1004.04] and you wing it along the way so you
[1002.52 - 1006.92] have to wait for four Olympics before
[1004.04 - 1009.40] that nutritionist really gets good so do
[1006.92 - 1011.48] you have a committee to select these
[1009.40 - 1014.88] individuals I think you need to go with
[1011.48 - 1017.04] a wisdom culture experiential culture so
[1014.88 - 1020.72] one is the problem of who's being
[1017.04 - 1023.04] recruited and is it Nam V uh people that
[1020.72 - 1025.44] you are recruiting um so I don't want to
[1023.04 - 1027.88] poke holes at which nutritionist is out
[1025.44 - 1029.88] there or which uh Sports coaches out
[1027.88 - 1031.88] there that's not doing their jobs but
[1029.88 - 1033.92] this is something that we need to do
[1031.88 - 1036.04] once you identify these people you sit
[1033.92 - 1039.64] them down if you're going for the next
[1036.04 - 1042.56] Olympics we start one year in advance
[1039.64 - 1045.96] with Olympic probables and confirmed
[1042.56 - 1049.60] Olympic go-getters all of them are put
[1045.96 - 1053.44] on a nutrition plan each athlete
[1049.60 - 1056.40] is monitored by a msse or PhD nutrition
[1053.44 - 1059.52] student his or her dissertation depends
[1056.40 - 1062.36] on the qualification Mark level for this
[1059.52 - 1064.88] athlete now once you do this if you have
[1062.36 - 1068.44] a personalized nutritionist let's say
[1064.88 - 1071.40] one nutritionist can handle 30 athletes
[1068.44 - 1072.96] for the year that person's sole
[1071.40 - 1074.12] responsibility is these 30 athletes now
[1072.96 - 1075.64] you don't give One Nutrition you give
[1074.12 - 1078.20] two nutritionist because what if that
[1075.64 - 1080.00] nutritionist Falls sick or what if that
[1078.20 - 1082.72] physio Falls sick or Then massio Fall
[1080.00 - 1085.08] sick so every 30 athletes get two
[1082.72 - 1087.96] nutritionist and once you get this you
[1085.08 - 1091.00] begin to start the diet planning process
[1087.96 - 1093.20] based on blood test genetic test
[1091.00 - 1095.60] microbiome test the microbiome test is
[1093.20 - 1098.00] done every 90 days to see how the diet
[1095.60 - 1100.96] is affecting the gut microbiome the
[1098.00 - 1103.16] mental anxiety is even impacted by the
[1100.96 - 1106.08] diet the depression in the athlete is
[1103.16 - 1107.92] impacted by the gut health so microbiome
[1106.08 - 1110.60] analysis really takes you to the next
[1107.92 - 1112.20] level I have had who say that Dr Ryan
[1110.60 - 1113.80] and I'm not even a doctor I'm just a
[1112.20 - 1115.72] nutritionist but out of respect they say
[1113.80 - 1118.56] that to me what am I eating that you
[1115.72 - 1120.72] making me feel so good so it's a process
[1118.56 - 1122.16] of knowing which foods are thumbs up
[1120.72 - 1123.80] which foods are thumbs down have you
[1122.16 - 1126.24] done a food intolerance test for the
[1123.80 - 1128.20] Indian Olympic team you haven't done it
[1126.24 - 1130.68] when you say V protein do they really
[1128.20 - 1133.08] need to take V protein what if they
[1130.68 - 1134.68] allergic to Dairy so these are points
[1133.08 - 1138.84] that are not considered you're winging
[1134.68 - 1141.80] it you're winging it India is winging it
[1138.84 - 1145.48] Dal chavel Roti has no say in the
[1141.80 - 1147.12] athletes life so when I put this
[1145.48 - 1148.64] together I'll come into when we start
[1147.12 - 1150.32] traveling to those time zones look at
[1148.64 - 1152.40] temperature look at humidity look at
[1150.32 - 1154.32] hydration look at electrolytes look at
[1152.40 - 1156.60] five restaurants in 5 kilomet ranges
[1154.32 - 1159.88] hell let's carry our own I would put
[1156.60 - 1162.60] together 20 chefs for the next Olympics
[1159.88 - 1164.84] we hire an Indian restaurant if we going
[1162.60 - 1167.08] to Los Angeles we call up Mr vikas Kaa
[1164.84 - 1169.32] Chef can you arrange for 30 Indian chefs
[1167.08 - 1171.36] in USA we will put them on deputation
[1169.32 - 1173.76] over there let the whole Indian team
[1171.36 - 1176.72] reach their one month in advance let's
[1173.76 - 1178.92] pay to hire our own village let's work
[1176.72 - 1180.52] out over there transfer everyone into
[1178.92 - 1183.80] that time zone at that point when you
[1180.52 - 1186.64] begin to do stuff like this is only when
[1183.80 - 1188.92] you have an undeniable chance of
[1186.64 - 1190.84] winning because when you start doing
[1188.92 - 1193.00] this you've prepared for all
[1190.84 - 1196.20] contingencies and when you have your own
[1193.00 - 1198.20] food for example breakfast the conflicts
[1196.20 - 1200.76] that comes or the oats that comes or the
[1198.20 - 1202.44] poha that comes or the paraa that comes
[1200.76 - 1204.52] every ingredient on that is
[1202.44 - 1206.96] predetermined so I will tell my team hey
[1204.52 - 1208.68] guys find out the best wheat flake
[1206.96 - 1211.04] Brands find out the best oat brand
[1208.68 - 1212.92] France I want it all organic give me the
[1211.04 - 1214.68] nutritional profiling of these Brands I
[1212.92 - 1217.08] want to start one year in advance we
[1214.68 - 1218.32] will approve these as the food vendors I
[1217.08 - 1220.68] want blueberries which are the best
[1218.32 - 1222.68] blueberries in the world because my
[1220.68 - 1224.48] athlete doesn't need sadala blueberries
[1222.68 - 1227.24] he needs the best of the best
[1224.48 - 1230.96] blueberries right and we don't want to
[1227.24 - 1230.96] make the athlete decide these
[1232.04 - 1237.92] things so that is the function of us the
[1235.40 - 1239.68] organizations the the support staff the
[1237.92 - 1241.80] government and everything that's what we
[1239.68 - 1244.08] need to be doing and I'll tell you
[1241.80 - 1246.52] what's the problem the bureaucrats and
[1244.08 - 1249.76] the administrators are too scared so
[1246.52 - 1252.36] when I once worked with an organization
[1249.76 - 1255.88] and one of the athletes got tested dope
[1252.36 - 1258.68] positive because of sabotage we stopped
[1255.88 - 1260.40] the whole nutrition programs because we
[1258.68 - 1262.32] just too scared to give advice because
[1260.40 - 1264.80] what if the athlete test
[1262.32 - 1269.00] positive now I'm just trying to share
[1264.80 - 1271.16] with you that you will have ups and
[1269.00 - 1273.72] downs but that's part of life and you
[1271.16 - 1276.80] know the loss today I mean I was angry
[1273.72 - 1279.80] yesterday she lost it for 100 grams I
[1276.80 - 1282.84] mean and today as I reflect I think I
[1279.80 - 1284.40] feel for the doctor the physio the whole
[1282.84 - 1286.84] support
[1284.40 - 1288.64] team you can't plan for something like
[1286.84 - 1291.12] this
[1288.64 - 1293.36] but I asked this question were you well
[1291.12 - 1295.88] prepared enough with all contingencies
[1293.36 - 1297.76] planned out it's like going to war and I
[1295.88 - 1302.28] think India approaches the battlefield
[1297.76 - 1305.36] in sports in a very laid-back attitude
[1302.28 - 1308.48] from the nutrition perspective and sleep
[1305.36 - 1310.48] perspective so there's a lot of things
[1308.48 - 1312.68] that we could do and this was just a
[1310.48 - 1314.84] video from my heart saying that for the
[1312.68 - 1317.36] next Olympics I would love to offer my
[1314.84 - 1319.68] services to any athlete out there uh
[1317.36 - 1322.92] many of you think that uh I'm doing this
[1319.68 - 1324.72] for my own agenda the biggest agenda I
[1322.92 - 1328.00] have in life is to win an Olympic gold
[1324.72 - 1329.76] medal with the athlete you know and and
[1328.00 - 1332.60] I get trolled saying that where have you
[1329.76 - 1334.28] won the Olympic medal every athlete has
[1332.60 - 1336.64] a support team which includes the
[1334.28 - 1338.36] coaches and it is very personal because
[1336.64 - 1340.88] when the athlete wins have you noticed
[1338.36 - 1342.40] how much the coaches jump with joy
[1340.88 - 1344.84] because it's everyone's it's the
[1342.40 - 1347.24] athletes Victory it's the athletes medal
[1344.84 - 1349.52] but it's like parents right when I
[1347.24 - 1352.32] graduated my parents had the biggest
[1349.52 - 1355.40] smile on their face they're your biggest
[1352.32 - 1358.56] fans so I would love to be the biggest
[1355.40 - 1360.28] fan to all the Indian athletes and it'll
[1358.56 - 1362.04] be a pleasure for me to help everyone
[1360.28 - 1365.32] out in the next Olympics yes it's going
[1362.04 - 1367.84] to cost money but then there's an
[1365.32 - 1370.24] investment required for every victory in
[1367.84 - 1370.24] life
