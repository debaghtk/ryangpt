[0.20 - 4.48] our celebrity nutritionist whom we are
[2.48 - 6.82] glad to have amongst
[4.48 - 8.52] us
[6.82 - 11.56] [Applause]
[8.52 - 14.00] understand if the entire
[11.56 - 17.64] country had to
[14.00 - 20.32] have intelligence and Technology built
[17.64 - 22.15] into our roadways do you think it will
[20.32 - 26.48] be a pleasure to drive in
[22.15 - 30.12] [Music]
[26.48 - 33.20] India being an exceptionally
[30.12 - 36.76] focused individual because AI will beat
[33.20 - 39.96] us hands down any day students no longer
[36.76 - 43.08] need to be Geniuses because the world of
[39.96 - 43.08] competition has
[47.44 - 52.64] arrived 2,000 years from now if this
[49.84 - 54.60] recording is somewhere I still feel uh
[52.64 - 59.72] spaceships are going to be piloted by a
[54.60 - 59.72] captain but it'll all be run by AI
[61.04 - 67.68] but AI will not be able to defeat us on
[64.72 - 70.48] one quotient and that is called the
[67.68 - 70.48] emotional
[71.84 - 76.56] quotient you all in this room may have
[74.36 - 78.92] one day wanted to become a doctor I
[76.56 - 81.16] wasn't smart enough to become a doctor I
[78.92 - 84.56] didn't even get into engineering I got
[81.16 - 86.84] into BC microbiology and biochemistry
[84.56 - 90.00] but screw it I am changing people's
[86.84 - 92.84] lives because I choose to take a work
[90.00 - 94.56] load and change somebody's life because
[92.84 - 97.44] it beats any paycheck at the end of the
[94.56 - 98.80] day so work to change lives don't look
[97.44 - 101.64] at workload my
[98.80 - 105.08] friend our celebrity nutritionist whom
[101.64 - 105.08] we are glad to have amongst
[108.75 - 112.32] [Applause]
[114.92 - 119.96] usology
[116.80 - 121.64] sence science
[119.96 - 124.28] I think I don't need any other
[121.64 - 125.72] introduction over to you for thank you
[124.28 - 129.12] thank
[125.72 - 131.36] you hi everyone good afternoon how are
[129.12 - 131.36] you
[131.48 - 138.88] guys um I was given a topic that had me
[135.52 - 140.52] to do a lot of uh um research to make
[138.88 - 142.52] the presentation and the presentation
[140.52 - 144.48] came uh to me I don't know if it even
[142.52 - 145.44] will come up whether it's valid and
[144.48 - 148.00] stuff like that I'll just leave my
[145.44 - 149.64] laptop over here one second do you guys
[148.00 - 152.28] want to slide on top or you want me to
[149.64 - 155.32] speak speak
[152.28 - 158.72] speak was there was some nice AI slides
[155.32 - 160.56] made by my team um mul if you can get
[158.72 - 164.24] those air slides up for me it was on a
[160.56 - 167.48] pen drive if it comes over here okay so
[164.24 - 170.52] this is where technology fails and human
[167.48 - 173.40] skill comes so what's my lecture about
[170.52 - 175.76] technology and Innovation uh and stuff
[173.40 - 177.80] like that uh for those of you who do not
[175.76 - 180.56] know me in this audience my name is Ryan
[177.80 - 182.96] Fernando I am a nutritionist
[180.56 - 184.60] I probably have today one of the largest
[182.96 - 187.32] nutrition clinics in the country with
[184.60 - 190.80] 150 dietitians I started with two
[187.32 - 194.84] dieticians thank you so
[190.80 - 198.32] much and I have competitors who have
[194.84 - 201.32] larger clinics but they use uh
[198.32 - 204.04] artificial intelligence to run the
[201.32 - 206.44] programs of Wellness for the end
[204.04 - 209.32] consumer now many of these companies are
[206.44 - 213.20] funded I am not funded uh and so today
[209.32 - 217.24] when I when I did decided to speak it's
[213.20 - 219.68] it's kind of uh it's kind of not my
[217.24 - 221.48] story but your story uh and how does
[219.68 - 223.64] this go I just want to know in this
[221.48 - 225.60] audience how many of you all are in the
[223.64 - 229.80] wellness space or will go into careers
[225.60 - 231.68] of Wellness raise your hand almost 70%
[229.80 - 234.00] all right uh the reason I asked this
[231.68 - 236.64] question is this is this presentation is
[234.00 - 241.72] very relevant to your future and I see
[236.64 - 241.72] very young faces over here um
[241.92 - 248.12] today's newspaper 9 crores of fine was
[245.16 - 251.76] collected on the Bangalore my
[248.12 - 253.68] highway how much 9 crores what did they
[251.76 - 256.28] what did they do the police was not
[253.68 - 260.24] stopping people right how did they
[256.28 - 263.20] collect the fines cameras what is
[260.24 - 264.96] camera highspeed camera it was catching
[263.20 - 268.92] people without seat
[264.96 - 270.40] belts technology is making the cops feel
[268.92 - 273.68] really happy
[270.40 - 277.68] right 9 Crowes of fine in 2
[273.68 - 281.00] weeks okay so where were we you driving
[277.68 - 283.04] on myour Highway and you get fined
[281.00 - 286.12] what's the basis of this
[283.04 - 288.56] lecture if the entire
[286.12 - 292.20] country had to
[288.56 - 294.84] have intelligence and Technology built
[292.20 - 297.28] into our roadways do you think it will
[294.84 - 298.64] be a pleasure to drive in India
[297.28 - 301.96] absolutely
[298.64 - 303.56] yes 9 crores of fine would be found in 1
[301.96 - 306.56] minute in our entire
[303.56 - 308.12] country and within one year people would
[306.56 - 312.72] stop breaking the
[308.12 - 315.16] rules why because like me I one day had
[312.72 - 317.44] to drive my car it was two days my
[315.16 - 319.20] driver went on leave and I broke the
[317.44 - 321.56] signal on both
[319.20 - 323.32] days cuz I was thinking about somebody's
[321.56 - 324.60] diet chart and driving and the signal is
[323.32 - 325.72] going to turn red it's okay it's going
[324.60 - 329.96] to turn
[325.72 - 333.40] red so the moment I got that fine what
[329.96 - 335.96] happened was I began to recognize that
[333.40 - 338.04] that signal has a camera so I am going
[335.96 - 341.60] to stop First
[338.04 - 342.84] St human behavior you'll understand I
[341.60 - 344.48] know a lot of you paid money or
[342.84 - 346.92] something or come from a long way what's
[344.48 - 350.48] the relevance
[346.92 - 354.12] technology so today when I work in my
[350.48 - 356.00] clinic I'm always asking this question
[354.12 - 358.08] how can I get a better diet chart I
[356.00 - 359.88] worked with Amir Khan I worked with uh
[358.08 - 361.92] Shahid kapor vat kohi blah blah blah
[359.88 - 364.64] blah blah all the pro possible
[361.92 - 366.68] celebrities uh we built processes and
[364.64 - 369.76] systems in our nutrition clinic that
[366.68 - 372.56] range from genetic testing blood testing
[369.76 - 376.64] all of these things but do you know
[372.56 - 380.40] what 50 to 60% of the time we don't have
[376.64 - 381.60] the bandwidth capacity here to integrate
[380.40 - 383.48] it
[381.60 - 387.36] all
[383.48 - 389.80] so our generation those of you above 45
[387.36 - 391.32] your time is done in terms of you will
[389.80 - 394.64] work in the old school and you'll be
[391.32 - 397.64] good at what you do because you have the
[394.64 - 400.36] experience but to anyone who's under 40
[397.64 - 404.12] years of age in this room this is my
[400.36 - 407.40] first tip to you my first tip to you is
[404.12 - 410.48] become exceptionally brilliant human
[407.40 - 413.68] beings become exceptionally passionate
[410.48 - 417.80] about what you do in the wellness space
[413.68 - 420.24] it cannot be a 9 to5 job it cannot be a
[417.80 - 422.24] job it's a calling
[420.24 - 426.92] if you are going to counsel people in
[422.24 - 429.96] medicine ayura diet exercise physiology
[426.92 - 432.64] training Pilatus yoga whatever it is you
[429.96 - 435.76] do being an
[432.64 - 440.44] exceptionally focused individual because
[435.76 - 440.44] AI will beat us hands down any
[440.84 - 448.52] day but AI will not be able to defeat us
[445.12 - 450.24] on one quotient and that is called the
[448.52 - 453.52] emotional quotient
[450.24 - 456.00] as yet I somebody will pull this
[453.52 - 457.40] recording out 40 years later maybe an a
[456.00 - 458.08] pull it out and say look Ryan Fernando
[457.40 - 461.44] was
[458.08 - 463.24] wrong right but till such time I believe
[461.44 - 465.12] the emotional quotient of you is very
[463.24 - 469.80] important so I'll give you an
[465.12 - 473.60] example man first K you know killed his
[469.80 - 476.16] food and ate it then Community
[473.60 - 479.76] happened then some Elders were there and
[476.16 - 482.28] they told you know there is Tuli very
[479.76 - 484.32] good ashwag gandha is very good I
[482.28 - 487.00] started recommending to people then
[484.32 - 488.44] people like me came along okay we're
[487.00 - 491.04] like okay we nutritionist you need to
[488.44 - 493.16] follow this you need to do all of this
[491.04 - 496.64] and my reason for being invited here
[493.16 - 498.64] today was to say how good or bad is AI
[496.64 - 500.84] going to be for the future how is
[498.64 - 503.48] technology going to help us is it going
[500.84 - 506.08] to kill us so I'm just thinking I like
[503.48 - 508.40] the worst thoughts went through my head
[506.08 - 510.32] the robot realizes that I'm allergic to
[508.40 - 512.32] oranges
[510.32 - 515.80] and craftily
[512.32 - 517.04] Designs a super Biryani with orange
[515.80 - 519.04] extract in
[517.04 - 522.44] it now I know what all of you are
[519.04 - 524.84] thinking who puts orange flavor in a
[522.44 - 526.76] Biryani I'm playing with your thought
[524.84 - 530.48] process because you're a human and
[526.76 - 533.84] you've been able to identify that
[530.48 - 537.08] mistake I am putting scientific studies
[533.84 - 538.44] through AI it's helping me in clerical
[537.08 - 540.88] work
[538.44 - 543.28] currently it's not helping me in
[540.88 - 547.32] hard-hitting human
[543.28 - 551.20] thinking so I give you an example okay
[547.32 - 554.20] uh there's a study done on pomegranate
[551.20 - 558.24] juice and I remember reading it about 6
[554.20 - 561.12] 7even years ago and in one part I went
[558.24 - 563.60] wo this is amazing what was amazing
[561.12 - 565.92] cared intimida thickness for those of
[563.60 - 568.16] you who have a biology background cared
[565.92 - 571.16] artery there's a thickness and there's a
[568.16 - 573.40] scan that can be done on this artery so
[571.16 - 575.96] when you get plaque plaque is the
[573.40 - 577.96] deposits it begins to cut the size
[575.96 - 580.60] begins to become smaller and
[577.96 - 583.40] smaller so they found out that when they
[580.60 - 585.04] gave people I was even now I can't
[583.40 - 586.76] remember so I would have to use a
[585.04 - 588.24] computer to go to Google to search up
[586.76 - 590.68] the exact thing but you get when I'm
[588.24 - 593.92] going right I still need technology but
[590.68 - 596.48] the wo came from my brain which was
[593.92 - 599.48] reading which was when people took
[596.48 - 601.32] pomegranate extract with the seeds in it
[599.48 - 604.24] or pomegranate juice with the seeds
[601.32 - 607.96] Blended in the juice the cared
[604.24 - 611.16] intermedia thickness reduced by up to
[607.96 - 614.48] 35% after one year of daily
[611.16 - 617.92] consumption drainex in the human
[614.48 - 620.32] body so it helps you clear it up now I
[617.92 - 622.76] went to Ai and I forgot that
[620.32 - 624.32] study now can you imagine if I have to
[622.76 - 627.88] search for that study how much time it
[624.32 - 629.84] would take me I'd have to read article
[627.88 - 633.24] after article that Google would rank for
[629.84 - 634.76] me it'll be a 1hour job then find that
[633.24 - 636.84] research paper and remember that was the
[634.76 - 641.40] research paper then go to that so I told
[636.84 - 643.84] yeah to find it for me AI found about
[641.40 - 645.80] five more papers for me but I don't have
[643.84 - 648.04] the time to read those five more
[645.80 - 651.32] papers and I didn't know which favor so
[648.04 - 654.40] I I told AI I pulled out the PDF I
[651.32 - 656.36] banged the PDF into chat GPT version 4
[654.40 - 658.84] I'm using the paid version I'm paying
[656.36 - 662.44] 2,000 Rupees a month and boom I said
[658.84 - 664.96] okay there's this paper find this for me
[662.44 - 667.20] I'm sorry we are not able to comprehend
[664.96 - 667.20] your
[667.48 - 673.08] request
[669.28 - 676.56] but it gave me four more articles so
[673.08 - 679.16] basically if there's a there's a win for
[676.56 - 682.60] AI and there's a loss for AI I'm
[679.16 - 686.08] actually waving both Flags to you in the
[682.60 - 688.80] center is the human being so people ask
[686.08 - 689.92] me about this personal diet or personal
[688.80 - 693.16] medicine
[689.92 - 697.48] or AI medicine have you heard of robotic
[693.16 - 700.60] surgery yes is a robot doing the surgery
[697.48 - 704.92] alone so in the world of Health
[700.60 - 708.20] preventive health I believe the
[704.92 - 710.04] opportunity for each and every Indian to
[708.20 - 714.84] have a job is
[710.04 - 718.28] massive where we will fail we will fail
[714.84 - 722.16] because we don't have what is known as
[718.28 - 724.80] uh respect to a career or job we think
[722.16 - 727.60] of it as a 9 to5 there is a Malik over
[724.80 - 730.04] there Malik the boss or the owner the
[727.60 - 731.80] entrepreneur organization oh but when
[730.04 - 734.24] you're an entrepreneur when you run your
[731.80 - 736.76] own business then you change your
[734.24 - 738.56] behavior but here's the
[736.76 - 741.40] problem
[738.56 - 744.04] conglomerates are going to move towards
[741.40 - 746.52] branding conglomerates are going to move
[744.04 - 749.20] towards Mass scale don't understand what
[746.52 - 750.92] I'm saying would you choose to go to a
[749.20 - 752.52] po clinic in your lane in indran nagar
[750.92 - 755.36] or would you choose to go to a poloo
[752.52 - 757.44] hospital or manipal
[755.36 - 759.68] hospital and that doctor runs a
[757.44 - 762.60] Polyclinic is also practicing in manipal
[759.68 - 764.72] and in aole my point here is this if
[762.60 - 767.84] you're looking to build your career I'm
[764.72 - 769.40] seeing very young faces over here if
[767.84 - 772.28] you're looking to build your
[769.40 - 773.96] career Ai and technology is going to
[772.28 - 777.52] help you become
[773.96 - 780.40] great but if you do not have the human
[777.52 - 782.04] quotient to practice practice with
[780.40 - 784.16] empathy with passion I'll give you an
[782.04 - 786.00] example today there I was listening into
[784.16 - 789.00] a call from by one of my dietitians and
[786.00 - 793.04] she like so that means sir you're
[789.00 - 793.04] telling me that you didn't take the
[793.48 - 797.92] multivitamin could there be a better way
[795.52 - 800.32] you could have framed that
[797.92 - 801.44] question it's okay sir you know you've
[800.32 - 803.48] take you've forgotten to take the
[801.44 - 806.96] multivitamin I'm sure you were busy but
[803.48 - 809.84] we'll do it the other way so emotional
[806.96 - 812.16] quotient is very important because was
[809.84 - 813.96] your scientific acument and I think I'm
[812.16 - 819.56] going to be trolled on the internet for
[813.96 - 822.64] this students no longer need to be
[819.56 - 824.88] Geniuses students no longer need to be
[822.64 - 826.92] Geniuses because the world of
[824.88 - 830.52] computation has
[826.92 - 833.72] arrived my 11-year-old son I want him to
[830.52 - 836.88] learn people skills visit the world
[833.72 - 839.20] social studies learn about history but
[836.88 - 840.56] when he asked me today Papa what's the
[839.20 - 843.56] distance between the Sun and the Earth
[840.56 - 843.56] I'm like let's Google it
[843.60 - 848.32] up why would you need to memorize that
[846.04 - 850.44] in a textbook so for those of you who
[848.32 - 853.92] are learning those of you getting into a
[850.44 - 856.80] job your memorization is not the key
[853.92 - 858.52] skill I take interviews of dietitians
[856.80 - 860.84] when they join a company of doctors when
[858.52 - 863.60] they join our company they like don't
[860.84 - 865.92] you want to ask me any technical
[863.60 - 869.16] question there is no technical question
[865.92 - 872.36] that cannot get answered today in under
[869.16 - 876.08] 5 Seconds depending on your Broadband
[872.36 - 878.56] speed so what am I looking for I am
[876.08 - 882.60] looking for
[878.56 - 887.00] Indians who have our traditional
[882.60 - 890.08] cultures of P up a
[887.00 - 892.72] p right the other day somebody walked
[890.08 - 895.48] into my office it was a ker guy I looked
[892.72 - 900.48] at my reception and I
[895.48 - 900.48] says and she's like looking at me

[911.40 - 916.24] of you ever visited Japan or watched
[913.12 - 918.60] Japanese videos there's a certain love
[916.24 - 921.88] for the profession that they do we are
[918.60 - 924.36] 1.3 billion people we are probably going
[921.88 - 927.56] to be outpaced by
[924.36 - 930.12] AI because conglomerates and
[927.56 - 932.56] entrepreneurs like me when you give me
[930.12 - 934.92] SAS and walk into my clinic I'm going to
[932.56 - 937.92] look at my HR
[934.92 - 937.92] manager
[943.72 - 949.12] subcription human
[946.36 - 952.56] skill trust me the world is going to go
[949.12 - 954.84] to Star Trek probably your children
[952.56 - 956.76] won't need to work then the governments
[954.84 - 959.00] will have to figure out who are lazy
[956.76 - 961.96] people who are creative people who are
[959.00 - 964.80] intelligent people and give them task to
[961.96 - 967.44] do because everyone will get a same same
[964.80 - 968.32] payment and the task that you do will
[967.44 - 971.48] give you
[968.32 - 975.60] fulfillment I meet people who are 50 to
[971.48 - 975.60] 70 years of age in counseling
[976.12 - 984.68] rooms and they searching for fulfillment
[981.68 - 984.68] Ro
[986.76 - 993.28] BB so please understand understand that
[990.32 - 997.16] Wellness Health Care is going to be a
[993.28 - 1000.16] massive business in our
[997.16 - 1003.24] lives I'm hoping that I influence you in
[1000.16 - 1005.44] this room to become what I have become
[1003.24 - 1008.40] which is a nutritionist who's very well
[1005.44 - 1011.56] known so people say oh you speak very
[1008.40 - 1013.96] well do you know why I speak very well
[1011.56 - 1015.92] because I have been doing from 8:00 in
[1013.96 - 1020.16] the morning till 8:00 in the night for
[1015.92 - 1021.92] the last two decades B
[1020.16 - 1024.68] so you get good at talking right but now
[1021.92 - 1026.16] when you do B B you got to back it up
[1024.68 - 1028.00] right so when you go back and watch a
[1026.16 - 1029.36] movie with your wife while she's
[1028.00 - 1032.88] watching the movie you're looking at a
[1029.36 - 1035.84] scientific study and you're reading the
[1032.88 - 1039.00] subtitles why because you're put on this
[1035.84 - 1041.96] Earth to change the way People's Health
[1039.00 - 1045.12] is could I influence you on that thought
[1041.96 - 1047.96] process stop looking at it as a job and
[1045.12 - 1050.12] you will get very successful because
[1047.96 - 1051.84] people will be attract raed to you I
[1050.12 - 1054.28] want to go and meet this person for
[1051.84 - 1056.60] their blood test for their medicine for
[1054.28 - 1059.96] their physiotherapy for their exercise
[1056.60 - 1062.12] for the yoga pil whatever it is you will
[1059.96 - 1063.40] have that vibration the next thing you
[1062.12 - 1064.88] know the whole family is coming to you
[1063.40 - 1067.52] the next thing you know you've gone from
[1064.88 - 1069.40] one room Clinic to five rooms the next
[1067.52 - 1072.04] thing you know you've hired four people
[1069.40 - 1074.32] plus chat GPT and AI to help you along
[1072.04 - 1079.56] the way
[1074.32 - 1081.92] so Advanced AI is going to come in and
[1079.56 - 1085.44] and it's not going to
[1081.92 - 1089.96] win because humans are
[1085.44 - 1092.28] lazy think about it exercise variables
[1089.96 - 1095.92] tracks my seep and everything Ryan
[1092.28 - 1097.88] Fernando you have done 1,759 steps today
[1095.92 - 1100.56] the technology has not enabled me to
[1097.88 - 1103.04] walk more it's only informed me that I
[1100.56 - 1104.16] have not walked enough are you getting
[1103.04 - 1107.12] my
[1104.16 - 1112.00] picture so all these companies that are
[1107.12 - 1112.00] coming out today are spending heavily on
[1112.28 - 1116.52] Tech and I know there are no VCS in this
[1114.80 - 1120.88] room right
[1116.52 - 1123.56] now but this is it if you enter into a
[1120.88 - 1126.48] company or a business of your own or
[1123.56 - 1128.68] join a company that is into healthare
[1126.48 - 1132.12] people real estate value is going to be
[1128.68 - 1133.92] the most valuable asset to convince
[1132.12 - 1136.12] somebody to change this Behavior where
[1133.92 - 1137.76] he did not even walk 2,000 steps so
[1136.12 - 1139.48] imagine if you call me up like sir how
[1137.76 - 1142.20] many steps you did today
[1139.48 - 1144.28] Madam I did only 2,000 steps so what
[1142.20 - 1146.56] happened actually today was a holiday
[1144.28 - 1148.32] you know I had to go for happiest Health
[1146.56 - 1150.24] seminar so I got up late in the morning
[1148.32 - 1152.08] I didn't do my exercise in the morning I
[1150.24 - 1154.04] called it a day I didn't wear my watch
[1152.08 - 1155.44] till 1:00 maybe that could be a reason
[1154.04 - 1157.56] huh but sir did you walk in the morning
[1155.44 - 1159.40] no I didn't walk in the morning why you
[1157.56 - 1160.92] didn't walk in the morning Madam today's
[1159.40 - 1162.48] holiday now I going to go and meet some
[1160.92 - 1164.24] people I'm going to stand the whole day
[1162.48 - 1169.72] okay sir tomorrow morning can you walk
[1164.24 - 1173.28] yes AI can't do that as yet
[1169.72 - 1173.28] and even if could do it you'd be
[1175.76 - 1179.76] like
[1177.48 - 1181.92] car but if the person is there you'll go
[1179.76 - 1184.28] back to your B hey look at my dieti how
[1181.92 - 1189.28] she's talking to me that is human
[1184.28 - 1191.24] engagement like or dislike love or hate
[1189.28 - 1193.28] and that component in healthcare
[1191.24 - 1195.56] wellness and which is why if you met
[1193.28 - 1198.36] some of the most successful
[1195.56 - 1199.80] doctors their bedside manner is the best
[1198.36 - 1202.68] in the
[1199.80 - 1204.60] world has anyone met DTI the best
[1202.68 - 1207.60] bedside manner in the world that guy is
[1204.60 - 1210.08] a god of bedside manner so what am I
[1207.60 - 1213.12] saying to you become the god of bedside
[1210.08 - 1216.04] manner in human emotional capital and
[1213.12 - 1219.44] use AI to become
[1216.04 - 1221.96] your business partner and that would
[1219.44 - 1224.04] make you the most successful at whatever
[1221.96 - 1225.72] you do my team has put all of this
[1224.04 - 1229.52] together I've got to read it out okay
[1225.72 - 1229.52] machine learning algorithm
[1229.80 - 1235.12] blood test they're bringing out
[1231.72 - 1237.00] algorithms cholesterol algorithm by the
[1235.12 - 1239.80] way I'm old school okay I studied at Goa
[1237.00 - 1241.68] Medical College in 1996 so for those of
[1239.80 - 1245.32] you are not yet born at that time then
[1241.68 - 1246.84] you know how old I am okay so machine
[1245.32 - 1249.92] learning algorithm we looked at
[1246.84 - 1252.00] cholesterol profile LDL vldl HDL
[1249.92 - 1253.32] triglycerides uh lipoprotein A
[1252.00 - 1257.12] lipoprotein B
[1253.32 - 1259.00] homoy tuck you looked at it boom why
[1257.12 - 1263.08] because we saw that many numbers so
[1259.00 - 1265.48] here's my next tip to you you are an
[1263.08 - 1267.08] algorithm I know the tech companies are
[1265.48 - 1271.52] going to build an algorithm to make your
[1267.08 - 1275.08] life easier but if you want people to go
[1271.52 - 1278.20] wow all you have to do is start taking
[1275.08 - 1279.40] the basic tenants of your profession and
[1278.20 - 1282.20] practicing
[1279.40 - 1285.60] it and especially the youngsters who
[1282.20 - 1288.20] rely on calculators 2 + 2 is equal to 4
[1285.60 - 1290.56] that is AI for you but what if you know
[1288.20 - 1292.60] 2 plus two on your pen and paper the
[1290.56 - 1295.08] other person knows that this person has
[1292.60 - 1297.16] value maybe two generations down the
[1295.08 - 1298.64] line they will know that the AI is the
[1297.16 - 1302.64] person they need to turn
[1298.64 - 1304.56] to but this 90y old on the planet today
[1302.64 - 1307.00] till whoever is in this room your
[1304.56 - 1309.48] children will still trust a human being
[1307.00 - 1311.72] to give an opinion to give a therapy or
[1309.48 - 1315.00] to give a prognosis or
[1311.72 - 1318.64] prescription so the bottom line thread
[1315.00 - 1321.84] is you can have the best algorithms
[1318.64 - 1323.92] human behavior is a complex algorithm
[1321.84 - 1326.88] that we understand so practice more so
[1323.92 - 1331.00] I'll give an example up until last year
[1326.88 - 1335.88] I was doing 180 cases per year and it
[1331.00 - 1339.64] continued for 14 years my nearest
[1335.88 - 1343.44] colleague had the highest practice of 62
[1339.64 - 1345.20] cases per year so 14 years later you
[1343.44 - 1347.48] understand the spread of
[1345.20 - 1349.52] experience so this goes to all you
[1347.48 - 1351.92] youngsters
[1349.52 - 1353.64] sir it's 5:00 in the evening I'll not
[1351.92 - 1357.16] get bus back
[1353.64 - 1358.68] home you got bus you got Ola you got car
[1357.16 - 1361.00] you got air conditioner you got
[1358.68 - 1363.68] electricity you got Netflix You' got
[1361.00 - 1367.20] swiy you've got zomato you've got what
[1363.68 - 1369.92] to complain our hardest day in our life
[1367.20 - 1372.68] today was the easiest day of your
[1369.92 - 1375.80] grandfather sorry did I say that
[1372.68 - 1377.96] right no no no no no no it's the
[1375.80 - 1380.16] opposite right see I I need an air to
[1377.96 - 1382.64] correct that right now but you getting
[1380.16 - 1384.72] where I'm going right the the the the
[1382.64 - 1387.12] most difficult day of our life our
[1384.72 - 1390.24] grandfather will be like a what man no
[1387.12 - 1392.56] AC to sleep under the fan oh you have no
[1390.24 - 1395.36] computer my father said once he went on
[1392.56 - 1396.52] a date with my mom he waited for her for
[1395.36 - 1400.24] 3
[1396.52 - 1403.56] hours where are you I'm already
[1400.24 - 1405.48] here so use technology to your
[1403.56 - 1408.72] advantage by the way the variable
[1405.48 - 1411.08] Technologies are amazing in healthcare
[1408.72 - 1413.40] not because it's accurate I'm going to
[1411.08 - 1414.96] be shot by a few companies where I'm
[1413.40 - 1417.96] Consulting
[1414.96 - 1417.96] with
[1418.24 - 1423.16] but I've been very successful as a
[1420.72 - 1424.76] nutritionist because I use technology
[1423.16 - 1426.84] I'll give you an
[1424.76 - 1428.84] example I won't take names today I
[1426.84 - 1433.08] finished a very famous person in the
[1428.84 - 1435.48] morning and um he says okay I've done
[1433.08 - 1436.96] the microbiome test and I told him that
[1435.48 - 1440.32] he needed to
[1436.96 - 1442.64] avoid white right for the first two
[1440.32 - 1445.80] weeks and he said yes I'll follow it
[1442.64 - 1449.28] I'll do it the secret I wish to tell you
[1445.80 - 1452.96] is this if I had told him without an
[1449.28 - 1455.96] algorithmic data of testing his
[1452.96 - 1457.12]  his poop microbiome test for those
[1455.96 - 1459.48] of you who don't know what microbiome is
[1457.12 - 1461.40] it's found in the gut 1.5 kgs you can
[1459.48 - 1463.16] only analyze it by taking a stool sample
[1461.40 - 1466.88] stool meaning poop
[1463.16 - 1469.68]  so only after analyzing his
[1466.88 - 1472.56]  and I got his report of the DNA
[1469.68 - 1473.96] analysis of the bacteria in his gut and
[1472.56 - 1476.12] I told him that he shouldn't be eating
[1473.96 - 1478.32] white rice he said I'll I'll do it
[1476.12 - 1479.80] diligently for 2 weeks had I met him
[1478.32 - 1482.92] without the microbiome and told him you
[1479.80 - 1485.20] need to avoid rice idiot celebrity
[1482.92 - 1486.88] nutrition what he knows a full kandan
[1485.20 - 1489.16] eats rice all their life my grandfather
[1486.88 - 1492.16] D everyone ate rice why should I avoid
[1489.16 - 1495.16] rice so you got to figure out how to put
[1492.16 - 1498.40] all of this together um and this is the
[1495.16 - 1501.64] potential drawbacks of these diet apps
[1498.40 - 1504.48] or any apps that exercise apps and all I
[1501.64 - 1506.92] believe inherently only 5% of the human
[1504.48 - 1510.68] race will get up and punch you in the
[1506.92 - 1513.16] face those are the go-getters 95% of us
[1510.68 - 1514.72] are lazy right like I didn't do my
[1513.16 - 1516.96] workout today in the morning like I'm
[1514.72 - 1518.72] going for happiest Health My legs will
[1516.96 - 1520.68] hurt if I go on stage so I won't do my
[1518.72 - 1523.40] burpees push-ups
[1520.68 - 1525.28] nothing I want you to memorize or take
[1523.40 - 1527.92] photograph of these points because this
[1525.28 - 1530.88] is where you can make a difference to
[1527.92 - 1533.28] your life life your business okay lack
[1530.88 - 1536.80] of personalized guidance AI is not there
[1533.28 - 1539.32] as yet data security concerns dude if
[1536.80 - 1541.32] somebody gets my mobile phone I have
[1539.32 - 1544.80] probably at least 100 film stars and
[1541.32 - 1546.52] actors in there that's my biggest worry
[1544.80 - 1548.48] what happens when I have all their data
[1546.52 - 1552.56] online and it disappears or somebody
[1548.48 - 1555.44] takes it over Reliance on technology sir
[1552.56 - 1558.60] sir we're in Leela Palace uh sir one one
[1555.44 - 1561.40] client is arguing with us uh uh uh he
[1558.60 - 1565.24] his weight is uh 85 kgs normally the
[1561.40 - 1565.24] wing scale is showing 70
[1566.92 - 1572.16] kgs are you in the balroom yes sir we in
[1569.76 - 1574.28] the balroom is the floor carpeted yes
[1572.16 - 1576.00] sir the floor is carpeted go outside
[1574.28 - 1578.40] find marble flow place the wing scale
[1576.00 - 1581.08] over there the wing scale will work
[1578.40 - 1583.40] correctly how do I know that the dean of
[1581.08 - 1586.68] Goa Medical College made me do 1,000
[1583.40 - 1588.60] patients over 3 months Wing right stand
[1586.68 - 1591.84] take the wi and dude you have the
[1588.60 - 1591.84] electronic weighing skill we had that
[1592.52 - 1597.48] one whoever laughed in this room knows
[1594.76 - 1599.36] the weighing scale I'm talking about and
[1597.48 - 1602.72] which means you're
[1599.36 - 1604.68] old okay um I want to take some
[1602.72 - 1607.24] questions because I think it's all about
[1604.68 - 1609.64] you so let's take some questions and see
[1607.24 - 1611.28] if you've got value today uh by the way
[1609.64 - 1613.12] I've written a book called weightless
[1611.28 - 1616.16] and another book called eating secrets
[1613.12 - 1617.84] of champion so the best three questions
[1616.16 - 1620.84] that I get today will get a signed copy
[1617.84 - 1624.48] from you those fooks so who's asking the
[1620.84 - 1627.92] most non now don't go to Ai and ask ask
[1624.48 - 1627.92] Nando the best question
[1629.04 - 1633.76] possible how how does it work for
[1631.12 - 1633.76] questions over
[1635.28 - 1639.56] here just raise your hand if you have a
[1639.88 - 1644.24] question so is somebody going around oh
[1642.12 - 1645.25] they have individual mics how cool is
[1644.24 - 1647.16] your
[1645.25 - 1649.16] [Music]
[1647.16 - 1650.68] technology is there any questions that
[1649.16 - 1653.24] you want to ask me about nutrition in
[1650.68 - 1655.28] the previous one yes ma'am uh first of
[1653.24 - 1657.28] all I'm really excited to see you in
[1655.28 - 1659.76] person thank you your name please ma'am
[1657.28 - 1662.08] I'm Dr Keda nice to meet you Doctor nice
[1659.76 - 1665.04] to meet you I do follow your podcast and
[1662.08 - 1667.96] a huge fan of yours um so my first
[1665.04 - 1672.76] question uh is where is India in terms
[1667.96 - 1676.04] of Nutri genomics um are we are we you
[1672.76 - 1680.12] know still in the nent stage uh are or
[1676.04 - 1682.16] are we uh as um
[1680.12 - 1685.96] uh you know as advanced as the UK and
[1682.16 - 1688.00] the US so far um good question doctor
[1685.96 - 1690.68] I'll divide this question into two parts
[1688.00 - 1692.88] okay first part is we started that is my
[1690.68 - 1695.56] clinic started qual nutrition clinic
[1692.88 - 1698.16] started genetic neutronic testing in
[1695.56 - 1701.28] 2011 wow as early as then and we used to
[1698.16 - 1703.76] send the sample to the US uh we continue
[1701.28 - 1706.60] to be one of India's highest collectors
[1703.76 - 1707.96] of nutren tests and send it out because
[1706.60 - 1710.32] that's how I believe my practice should
[1707.96 - 1713.16] be run for example there was a question
[1710.32 - 1716.76] about gluten sensitivity in the previous
[1713.16 - 1719.92] and I think you mentioned hq8 and dq5
[1716.76 - 1723.88] and the sensitivity now that's what we
[1719.92 - 1727.76] do so the question over here is India at
[1723.88 - 1730.04] 1.3 billion we are not even doing 01 of
[1727.76 - 1731.56] the population first thing but those
[1730.04 - 1733.44] that can afford it and those that are
[1731.56 - 1735.76] getting influenced and listening into
[1733.44 - 1738.32] podcasts and blah blah blah or have the
[1735.76 - 1741.28] knowledge are slowly asking for the
[1738.32 - 1745.44] genomic which is the nutrition Gene
[1741.28 - 1747.44] testing right uh I have an issue with
[1745.44 - 1749.84] the nutrition Gene testing from a lot of
[1747.44 - 1753.36] formats is that the data is
[1749.84 - 1755.64] predominantly Caucasian driven so the
[1753.36 - 1758.04] statistical set of population that is
[1755.64 - 1762.76] being analyzed to say that this Gene
[1758.04 - 1765.04] pair H dq5 is towards gluten sensitivity
[1762.76 - 1767.08] I could throw a spanner in the works and
[1765.04 - 1769.44] say that but that is from that end of
[1767.08 - 1771.48] the population having said that I am no
[1769.44 - 1773.76] scientist so what I did is I started
[1771.48 - 1777.08] testing sets of people saying sir this
[1773.76 - 1778.60] is not our data but can we do it and the
[1777.08 - 1779.96] people that come to me have the money so
[1778.60 - 1782.16] they said yeah it's okay we can we can
[1779.96 - 1784.40] afford it you know we go out to Mal and
[1782.16 - 1786.24] we spend like 10 times that amount we
[1784.40 - 1787.76] started doing this and then if we got a
[1786.24 - 1790.56] negative
[1787.76 - 1794.16] genetics we now
[1790.56 - 1796.60] recalibrated the behavior towards the
[1794.16 - 1798.64] which is the epigenetics yeah which is
[1796.60 - 1801.28] Diet exercise environment
[1798.64 - 1805.00] and the change was monitored in a 6mon
[1801.28 - 1807.92] diet plan onee diet plan and we saw
[1805.00 - 1810.48] fantastic um Transformations if you
[1807.92 - 1812.20] would like to call it as a result it
[1810.48 - 1814.40] transformed from Olympic level
[1812.20 - 1816.00] Superstars into my clinic and then that
[1814.40 - 1819.24] Olympic level Superstars is being
[1816.00 - 1820.64] trained by that um fitness trainer the
[1819.24 - 1822.68] fitness trainer bring starts bringing
[1820.64 - 1824.08] his Rich lifestyle clients and then
[1822.68 - 1828.08] those people start doing it and so we'
[1824.08 - 1830.36] have had a phenomenal amount of movement
[1828.08 - 1833.84] in the space so much so that recently
[1830.36 - 1837.72] Reliance Industries purchased TR
[1833.84 - 1841.68] genomics when they did that I
[1837.72 - 1842.96] went which means in the next 10 years
[1841.68 - 1845.96] we're going to be doing a lot of
[1842.96 - 1848.00] sequencing of the Indian population and
[1845.96 - 1849.36] that's going to help us and this very
[1848.00 - 1851.96] interesting over here doctor since you
[1849.36 - 1855.00] asked this question we marry within
[1851.96 - 1858.08] communities right so you have individual
[1855.00 - 1860.52] population sizes which could be like
[1858.08 - 1862.28] like uh you could do a PhD in a Goan
[1860.52 - 1866.36] population you could do a PhD in a
[1862.28 - 1868.20] Telugu population on one gene in wheat
[1866.36 - 1869.64] yeah there's so much of research
[1868.20 - 1871.48] potential available so I hope I've
[1869.64 - 1873.60] answered your question yes yes I just
[1871.48 - 1875.20] one followup question to the same thing
[1873.60 - 1877.64] this qu nutrition do anything in
[1875.20 - 1880.24] nutritional research like exactly like
[1877.64 - 1884.56] you said do we have a rigorous
[1880.24 - 1887.00] nutritional research Fraternity in India
[1884.56 - 1888.64] research at all is quite in India but
[1887.00 - 1891.60] how are we nutrition
[1888.64 - 1894.28] no so I've had limited money building CO
[1891.60 - 1896.68] nutrition not taken funding our research
[1894.28 - 1899.04] is mostly of talented dieticians and the
[1896.68 - 1900.68] team who go into the internet and do it
[1899.04 - 1903.24] but I can tell you
[1900.68 - 1906.12] that icmr and National Institute of
[1903.24 - 1910.20] nutrition the people that are there they
[1906.12 - 1912.40] are doing research is it at a level that
[1910.20 - 1914.36] Ryan Fernando would be happy I I would
[1912.40 - 1918.68] love to be the CEO of national ins
[1914.36 - 1920.48] nutrition and really push the envelope
[1918.68 - 1924.24] for nutrition research in India in two
[1920.48 - 1926.96] departments rural and urban so rural is
[1924.24 - 1930.64] where we have all the diseases which are
[1926.96 - 1932.68] from a lack of nutrition and in in in
[1930.64 - 1934.44] urban it's your metabolic issues and and
[1932.68 - 1938.12] stuff like that and that is a that is a
[1934.44 - 1939.84] bottomless bit so um maybe 10 years from
[1938.12 - 1941.64] now we'll start a research institute
[1939.84 - 1944.08] let's do that somebody over here will
[1941.64 - 1946.20] head it thank you thank you so much
[1944.08 - 1949.20] doctor a weakless book meet me
[1946.20 - 1951.52] afterwards lovely question any other
[1949.20 - 1955.44] questions anyone has a cat a taxi can
[1951.52 - 1958.28] leave okay yeah uh R my question very
[1955.44 - 1961.80] yeah my question to you is name sir yeah
[1958.28 - 1963.92] Arava from impeccable Innovations bang
[1961.80 - 1967.12] okay uh so we have been working with
[1963.92 - 1970.20] autistic kids a lot especially below 8
[1967.12 - 1974.12] years of age so from your experience how
[1970.20 - 1977.12] is autism uh is it spreading very fast
[1974.12 - 1979.60] in India and what's your intake for the
[1977.12 - 1982.12] future of this children especially from
[1979.60 - 1984.88] nutrition point of
[1982.12 - 1987.00] so I don't have the statistical data on
[1984.88 - 1989.60] its predict but I'm assuming at 1.3
[1987.00 - 1992.56] billion population we have a lot of
[1989.60 - 1995.12] clinically undiagnosed autistic children
[1992.56 - 1996.96] my experience is with autistic children
[1995.12 - 1999.96] in fact we have periodic nutritionist in
[1996.96 - 2003.60] our Clinic my first ever experience was
[1999.96 - 2006.76] my most memorable autistic case around
[2003.60 - 2008.48] 2011 uh and the girl had never spoken in
[2006.76 - 2012.28] her life at the age of
[2008.48 - 2015.24] eight and we uh sent her entire stool
[2012.28 - 2018.20] blood and urine sample to the US uh the
[2015.24 - 2019.32] lab was called uh genetic Geneva
[2018.20 - 2021.36] Laboratories and it's called the
[2019.32 - 2024.56] neutraal test that is like the
[2021.36 - 2026.76] Rolls-Royce of testing was ,000 test now
[2024.56 - 2028.84] why am I telling you this whole story
[2026.76 - 2030.40] when we began to change her diet because
[2028.84 - 2033.00] there's enough of research out there on
[2030.40 - 2035.88] gluten-free casin free and our Indian
[2033.00 - 2038.56] diet is loaded with gluten and casine
[2035.88 - 2042.72] casine is your paneer glut is your bread
[2038.56 - 2044.68] Roy and so we contaminated and autistic
[2042.72 - 2047.08] children before the ages of 12 will have
[2044.68 - 2048.68] a certain mouth field taste that they do
[2047.08 - 2051.00] not want to experiment with so if you
[2048.68 - 2052.52] try and be adventurous as a nutritionist
[2051.00 - 2053.88] they're going to shut you down they're
[2052.52 - 2056.12] used to something and then they throw
[2053.88 - 2060.36] tantrums and the parents can't take
[2056.12 - 2062.16] it so I have seen that girl in four
[2060.36 - 2065.24] months of a diet plan who had black
[2062.16 - 2068.08] stools because of huge amount of fungal
[2065.24 - 2070.92] infection in the stool say mama for the
[2068.08 - 2073.16] first time so for me that was proof in
[2070.92 - 2075.44] the pudding that Ryan Fernando whatever
[2073.16 - 2079.92] you're doing this group is there having
[2075.44 - 2082.84] said that I had an own neighbor of mine
[2079.92 - 2084.04] who had an autistic kid and I was like P
[2082.84 - 2085.32] you got to do this you got to do this
[2084.04 - 2088.00] you know you do the genetic test you
[2085.32 - 2090.24] need to do this you need to nut and the
[2088.00 - 2093.00] guy drives a highend vehicle where's a
[2090.24 - 2096.04] Rolex watch and didn't do it so the
[2093.00 - 2097.76] problem over here is parents are unaware
[2096.04 - 2100.96] that nutrition will have a sign
[2097.76 - 2104.04] significant impact on the development
[2100.96 - 2105.16] and the association of relationship I
[2104.04 - 2107.32] don't know what you call it but the
[2105.16 - 2109.88] interaction at human beings can be
[2107.32 - 2112.24] marred by bad nutrition and it's the
[2109.88 - 2114.96] parents responsibility to change the
[2112.24 - 2116.28] nutrition and in the affluent classes
[2114.96 - 2118.36] it's happening because the parents have
[2116.28 - 2120.44] the ability to learn but in poor India
[2118.36 - 2122.68] it doesn't happen and there's another
[2120.44 - 2124.48] problem parents in today's world are
[2122.68 - 2125.48] having accidental pregnancies which they
[2124.48 - 2127.24] shouldn't because they're having only
[2125.48 - 2129.16] one or two children they should have
[2127.24 - 2131.32] planned pregnancies which means the
[2129.16 - 2133.76] husband should not smoke drink or have
[2131.32 - 2135.44] coffee 3 to 6 months before they say
[2133.76 - 2138.40] they're going to try a baby so with the
[2135.44 - 2140.60] woman so when your diet is devoid of
[2138.40 - 2144.72] insecticides pesticides and all of these
[2140.60 - 2146.84] narcotics or Street Foods ptic uh Foods
[2144.72 - 2149.40] you're obese you're overweight people
[2146.84 - 2152.80] say how did I get an autistic
[2149.40 - 2155.08] kid I don't need to answer it but you
[2152.80 - 2156.80] know you see so many people coming in
[2155.08 - 2158.28] and then when you take a track record of
[2156.80 - 2160.64] what they did in the last 20 years and
[2158.28 - 2163.24] then when they conceive that's uh that's
[2160.64 - 2165.00] a whole thing actually the main thing
[2163.24 - 2167.64] the main problem is coming in our
[2165.00 - 2169.92] society is when we know that the child
[2167.64 - 2172.88] May recover but the parent is not able
[2169.92 - 2175.52] to imagine how can a nutrition improve a
[2172.88 - 2178.12] autistic child so that's the realization
[2175.52 - 2180.64] point is very low currently which is
[2178.12 - 2183.48] which is why um you know to be honest
[2180.64 - 2186.16] with you I don't need to do Instagram or
[2183.48 - 2187.32] podcast like my media team came and say
[2186.16 - 2189.72] sir do you want to become famous I'm
[2187.32 - 2192.00] like do have you seen my phone book the
[2189.72 - 2193.44] who who of the world have come to me but
[2192.00 - 2196.20] the reason we're going to the podcast
[2193.44 - 2199.04] because of this problem General India
[2196.20 - 2200.76] doesn't understand that as yet but the
[2199.04 - 2202.12] people who are very Elight have figured
[2200.76 - 2205.00] it out why do they figure it out they
[2202.12 - 2206.92] travel abroad they meet overseas experts
[2205.00 - 2208.76] they see Society over there so they come
[2206.92 - 2211.28] back
[2208.76 - 2213.40] like like women in India think you work
[2211.28 - 2216.24] out you you go to a foreign gym and
[2213.40 - 2218.52] watch foreign women work out it's a
[2216.24 - 2220.56] different level so so anyone who's gone
[2218.52 - 2222.48] abroad looks at the way people work out
[2220.56 - 2224.40] like dude I'm taking a stroll in the
[2222.48 - 2226.76] park so they change their workout the
[2224.40 - 2228.92] same goes for healthare in making
[2226.76 - 2232.84] parents uh realize you're talking about
[2228.92 - 2235.32] autism which is mandatory Sports
[2232.84 - 2238.72] Nutrition I want my kid to become vat
[2235.32 - 2241.64] kohi I want my kid to become K
[2238.72 - 2244.48] Rahul but parents are not willing to
[2241.64 - 2246.04] even understand with the internet what
[2244.48 - 2248.04] are the better foods to give their
[2246.04 - 2249.92] children so I think
[2248.04 - 2253.20] um of those of you who become parents in
[2249.92 - 2255.52] the future spend more time in educating
[2253.20 - 2257.12] your children what is right what is
[2255.52 - 2258.76] wrong don't give them sugar don't give
[2257.12 - 2260.76] them salt I think we could start with
[2258.76 - 2262.96] those Basics all of this neutr genomics
[2260.76 - 2265.16] and all of that stuff is like Star Trek
[2262.96 - 2266.84] for most people and they don't
[2265.16 - 2269.36] understand it and then you have this
[2266.84 - 2271.52] world of influencers today uh this is
[2269.36 - 2275.04] the biggest biggest problem today is
[2271.52 - 2277.08] that um and I can't take names but you
[2275.04 - 2278.08] will you should have this template in
[2277.08 - 2280.52] your head
[2278.08 - 2283.00] look for people who are qualified not
[2280.52 - 2284.92] certified what do I mean by that
[2283.00 - 2287.52] qualified means you went and studied
[2284.92 - 2289.16] that certified means oh you know my
[2287.52 - 2291.00] father spent so much for me to become an
[2289.16 - 2293.12] engineer and everything now I decided to
[2291.00 - 2296.60] do
[2293.12 - 2300.24] medicine so people are giving advice
[2296.60 - 2304.44] based on their wisdom of experience and
[2300.24 - 2306.96] I think that is where I have an issue so
[2304.44 - 2309.40] the creation of influence is important
[2306.96 - 2311.52] influence are important they should give
[2309.40 - 2313.68] you an awareness yeah Ryan today you
[2311.52 - 2315.56] have to walk more number of steps but
[2313.68 - 2318.88] when Ryan has to choose a physical
[2315.56 - 2321.12] activity he needs to go to a
[2318.88 - 2322.84] physiotherapist to look at his body
[2321.12 - 2326.24] alignment and everything rather than
[2322.84 - 2328.24] going to maybe a Gym trainer who will
[2326.24 - 2330.16] give me the exercise but has not yet
[2328.24 - 2332.60] assessed my body for the postural
[2330.16 - 2335.08] alignments any sort of biomechanical
[2332.60 - 2337.68] deficiencies etc etc so right now India
[2335.08 - 2340.72] is a free-for all country 1.3 billion
[2337.68 - 2343.16] everyone's doing expertise training in
[2340.72 - 2344.76] various subject matters I'm happy with
[2343.16 - 2346.88] the government of India because certain
[2344.76 - 2349.64] bills and acts are going to be passed
[2346.88 - 2350.64] where people need to be licensed so now
[2349.64 - 2352.48] once you have
[2350.64 - 2354.32] licensing you have to understand
[2352.48 - 2357.12] government will start pushing it so
[2354.32 - 2358.84] nutrigenomic testing will be pushed uh
[2357.12 - 2360.64] autism children testings all of these
[2358.84 - 2363.80] things will slowly happen I think we
[2360.64 - 2366.24] need to give 5 to 10 years and this will
[2363.80 - 2369.56] all happen next question I have 9
[2366.24 - 2371.56] minutes left so my time I'm here it's a
[2369.56 - 2374.20] great point I think you covered quite a
[2371.56 - 2375.68] bit of it um and I'm a mom of three so I
[2374.20 - 2378.76] get what you're saying about nutrition
[2375.68 - 2381.68] for children and how much moms play an
[2378.76 - 2384.64] important role and also educating
[2381.68 - 2387.64] mothers um on a deeper level is very
[2384.64 - 2389.60] important and talking about AI one thing
[2387.64 - 2392.28] I I've noticed is like you know the chat
[2389.60 - 2395.48] box where you could say that give me
[2392.28 - 2398.12] nutrition plan or give me the meat plan
[2395.48 - 2400.20] so where do you see all the diti experts
[2398.12 - 2402.60] in nutrition other than the emotional
[2400.20 - 2404.16] ction aspect of it is it more of an
[2402.60 - 2409.48] accountability that they're going to
[2404.16 - 2412.04] stand for or more than that so I I think
[2409.48 - 2414.44] um when you look
[2412.04 - 2417.56] at like you said you know you download
[2414.44 - 2419.12] from chat p a diet plan uh in fact one
[2417.56 - 2420.52] of my business partners is doing it
[2419.12 - 2422.72] right now and he's actually laughing in
[2420.52 - 2424.76] my face like look dude it's just giving
[2422.72 - 2427.84] me a 7-Day Diet
[2424.76 - 2428.80] plan but what happens over there is is
[2427.84 - 2431.60] human
[2428.80 - 2434.40] motivation is easily
[2431.60 - 2436.44] lost I'm being recorded
[2434.40 - 2440.32] right
[2436.44 - 2442.92] so 15 14 years ago about this time I was
[2440.32 - 2445.20] pitching my nutrition clinics to at
[2442.92 - 2448.04] least about 35 40
[2445.20 - 2449.92] VCS and I got rejected and shut down by
[2448.04 - 2451.72] every one of them saying that you know
[2449.92 - 2453.36] it won't work and then over the years
[2451.72 - 2454.72] you see all of these Brands come out
[2453.36 - 2457.32] with
[2454.72 - 2458.60] technology um various of them and now
[2457.32 - 2460.36] they're struggling they're laying off
[2458.60 - 2461.92] people they've taken funding they want
[2460.36 - 2465.84] to become a unicorn but they can't get
[2461.92 - 2467.20] it there I said to them 14 years ago
[2465.84 - 2472.60] whatever your
[2467.20 - 2472.60] technology Indians like Guru
[2472.88 - 2478.24] dakshana we love we love talking to
[2476.48 - 2480.92] somebody and getting advice from a
[2478.24 - 2484.12] person so my lecture was about you know
[2480.92 - 2485.92] um this point um which is what you've
[2484.12 - 2488.52] asked and I didn't play the slide
[2485.92 - 2491.44] optimizing nutritional roles AI so it's
[2488.52 - 2494.88] going to enhance not replace so whilst
[2491.44 - 2494.88] you do a diet plan with an
[2495.32 - 2501.80] AI the AI currently at this time by next
[2499.16 - 2504.40] year could change drastically the
[2501.80 - 2506.60] integration of what I do microbiome
[2504.40 - 2508.72] testing genetic testing all of that will
[2506.60 - 2510.04] begin to give you a blueprint a
[2508.72 - 2512.28] personalized
[2510.04 - 2515.00] blueprint but once you start doing that
[2512.28 - 2517.64] you'll realize that you want to go and
[2515.00 - 2520.80] meet somebody and be held accountable
[2517.64 - 2522.76] and my business experience is has been
[2520.80 - 2525.88] this billionaires millionaires
[2522.76 - 2528.72] Housewives moms working mom coo moms
[2525.88 - 2530.68] children everyone want to come like kids
[2528.72 - 2531.88] let's go meet Uncle Ryan on Saturday not
[2530.68 - 2534.56] because they want to meet Uncle Ryan in
[2531.88 - 2537.04] indagar because indagar is the best hot
[2534.56 - 2538.32] spot for restaurants in mangalo so after
[2537.04 - 2539.40] meeting Uncle Ryan they're going for the
[2538.32 - 2542.32] cheat
[2539.40 - 2546.72] meal but jokes
[2542.32 - 2548.16] aart I hold people accountable and after
[2546.72 - 2549.68] college
[2548.16 - 2551.80] your teachers and your principls hold
[2549.68 - 2553.16] you accountable with your marksheet then
[2551.80 - 2557.08] the only other person who holds you
[2553.16 - 2560.04] accountable is your company and your
[2557.08 - 2563.16] spouse most married people begin to
[2560.04 - 2564.60] ignore their spouses after 10 years the
[2563.16 - 2566.60] little bit of Giggles over here are
[2564.60 - 2570.32] those who are getting who are married
[2566.60 - 2572.60] okay so what happens is the AI component
[2570.32 - 2576.20] will not be able to hold you accountable
[2572.60 - 2578.12] my fitness SP healthy FY gabit all of
[2576.20 - 2579.88] these brands are coming out they're
[2578.12 - 2582.48] keeping people over there to hold you
[2579.88 - 2584.40] accountable and I recently interviewed
[2582.48 - 2586.80] four or five dietitians from a company
[2584.40 - 2589.36] that's shutting down dietitians and they
[2586.80 - 2592.12] saying PE people are saying sir we know
[2589.36 - 2595.36] the chart is from an AI but we want you
[2592.12 - 2598.56] to call us up which is what my beginning
[2595.36 - 2602.72] lecture was about human quotient so if
[2598.56 - 2604.56] that can come in it's great uh I've been
[2602.72 - 2607.28] recommending the whoop since the
[2604.56 - 2610.00] pandemic so many people like oh ver K is
[2607.28 - 2611.96] the whoop and everything recommend whoop
[2610.00 - 2614.40] so what's whoop whoop is one of the most
[2611.96 - 2616.76] sophisticated exercise variable bands it
[2614.40 - 2618.36] doesn't even have a digital screen on it
[2616.76 - 2620.40] so it'll give you everything from your
[2618.36 - 2624.00] heart rate your strain everything
[2620.40 - 2625.96] possible the insights you get on that
[2624.00 - 2629.28] integrated to a dietitian so I'll give
[2625.96 - 2631.64] you an example I had a um 70-year-old
[2629.28 - 2633.52] man who was not sleeping well and on the
[2631.64 - 2635.80] whoop we figured out what was the
[2633.52 - 2637.40] problem so we realized that when he was
[2635.80 - 2639.40] working out he was getting a peak heart
[2637.40 - 2641.88] rate so we asked him to meet the
[2639.40 - 2644.08] cardiologist card cardiologist did a
[2641.88 - 2646.60] battery of test and said that XY Z was
[2644.08 - 2648.16] an issue the changeed some medication
[2646.60 - 2650.64] they asked him to not exercise at that
[2648.16 - 2653.40] level his sleep changed so I think
[2650.64 - 2656.20] that's where technology is going to go
[2653.40 - 2659.24] and 2,000 years from now this recording
[2656.20 - 2661.76] is somewhere I still feel spaceships are
[2659.24 - 2664.36] going to be piloted by a captain but it
[2661.76 - 2667.16] will all be run by AI at the end of the
[2664.36 - 2669.48] day I hope I've answered your question
[2667.16 - 2674.84] thank you yes
[2669.48 - 2677.52] sir hi I'm Dr from happiest he my
[2674.84 - 2680.32] question is like uh do you think that AI
[2677.52 - 2682.20] will be useful in designing tyes for the
[2680.32 - 2683.80] people who are living who you can say
[2682.20 - 2686.36] who are staying in the hospitals
[2683.80 - 2690.32] especially in the icus on the for a long
[2686.36 - 2692.04] period of time um I run a nutrition
[2690.32 - 2694.60] clinic so I'd like to think that won't
[2692.04 - 2697.92] happen because then my business will go
[2694.60 - 2699.68] down but jokes apart the correct answer
[2697.92 - 2702.20] or the most scientific answer it it
[2699.68 - 2705.32] needs to happen my thinking comes from
[2702.20 - 2708.00] the logic that apparently AI has been
[2705.32 - 2711.24] able to scan in trauma patients who come
[2708.00 - 2714.64] in the uh CT scans and a doctor has
[2711.24 - 2717.92] experience of maybe about 7 to 10,000 CT
[2714.64 - 2720.00] scans in a trauma unit but AI could scan
[2717.92 - 2723.44] all the CT scans which could be as much
[2720.00 - 2727.20] as 2 billion and within 4
[2723.44 - 2730.20] seconds give you the most practical
[2727.20 - 2733.52] uh funneled version of what medical
[2730.20 - 2736.40] trials decision you need to take so I
[2733.52 - 2739.36] believe that in hospital
[2736.40 - 2741.52] care uh the dietician would be available
[2739.36 - 2743.84] for her bedside manner like the doctor
[2741.52 - 2746.88] is available I was very disappointed
[2743.84 - 2749.08] when Google Glass disappeared because my
[2746.88 - 2750.52] thought process was I would be talking
[2749.08 - 2752.20] to you right now and my glass would be
[2750.52 - 2754.64] going to say this say this say this say
[2752.20 - 2757.32] this say this right that's what's going
[2754.64 - 2759.64] to happen in hospitals and I know the
[2757.32 - 2763.76] people that are doing it already so you
[2759.64 - 2766.16] can expect in the next four or 5 years
[2763.76 - 2768.72] uh many doctors who are not keeping Pace
[2766.16 - 2770.60] are going to get affronted by technology
[2768.72 - 2775.24] so you're going to see a rapid change of
[2770.60 - 2777.32] the Old Guard 60 plus year old doctors
[2775.24 - 2779.04] improving their bedside manner because
[2777.32 - 2781.36] the younger generation is relying on
[2779.04 - 2785.12] technology so they'll be in the trauma
[2781.36 - 2787.08] cases medical cases urgent care but
[2785.12 - 2789.24] people who need preventive care like r
[2787.08 - 2791.84] Fernando 70 years old hello doctor how
[2789.24 - 2793.36] are you so my BP is a little so this is
[2791.84 - 2795.80] what's going to happen in our universe
[2793.36 - 2797.52] right now I hope I've answered your
[2795.80 - 2799.44] question so there's an important
[2797.52 - 2802.32] question how do you see
[2799.44 - 2806.40] this where hi how do you see this
[2802.32 - 2810.12] effective mental health as we know that
[2806.40 - 2813.00] um how do I see technology affecting
[2810.12 - 2817.40] mental health oh it's already affected
[2813.00 - 2819.76] us have you seen any teenager today have
[2817.40 - 2821.72] you seen anyone on a flight have you
[2819.76 - 2824.08] seen human
[2821.72 - 2825.64] interaction people are in their phones I
[2824.08 - 2827.60] was on the Metro the other day and I was
[2825.64 - 2829.84] like everyone
[2827.60 - 2831.16] think I'm like hi I'm Ryan Fernando
[2829.84 - 2835.04] nobody's looking
[2831.16 - 2836.68] up you got a free counseling with me you
[2835.04 - 2838.60] could just say Sir hi what do you think
[2836.68 - 2840.76] about this time I'm like yeah yeah I'm
[2838.60 - 2844.48] from the old generation where we talk
[2840.76 - 2847.92] mental health is getting affected limit
[2844.48 - 2850.64] your mobile phone um talk to your family
[2847.92 - 2852.20] friends go out have a bag all the
[2850.64 - 2854.24] friends put the mobile phones together
[2852.20 - 2856.48] and for 1 hour
[2854.24 - 2859.32] talk I think that's where the mental
[2856.48 - 2861.48] health problem is coming in I'm I'm
[2859.32 - 2863.40] Psychotherapy and a behavior specialist
[2861.48 - 2864.56] and it's very very difficult nowadays to
[2863.40 - 2866.72] convince like he said what you're
[2864.56 - 2869.12] looking for is the basic manners the
[2866.72 - 2872.08] courtesy asking for water even today
[2869.12 - 2873.80] when when I have a speak Z come I offer
[2872.08 - 2876.28] something or even if it's a packet of
[2873.80 - 2878.36] biscuits or something that's wonderful I
[2876.28 - 2880.56] just these
[2878.36 - 2883.24] values I'm also going to start doing
[2880.56 - 2885.60] that but I'll not do packet of
[2883.24 - 2887.00] biscuits maybe I'll give him cucumber
[2885.60 - 2889.32] he'll probably throw the Cucumber back
[2887.00 - 2892.60] at me his mental health would say Throw
[2889.32 - 2894.80] throw the Cucumber back so I I want to
[2892.60 - 2896.40] take your question a little deeper now
[2894.80 - 2897.52] that you've identified what you do and
[2896.40 - 2900.28] what you
[2897.52 - 2902.64] practice and and forgive me I I you you
[2900.28 - 2905.60] you have permission to troll me in
[2902.64 - 2907.28] Psychiatry the one organ that is
[2905.60 - 2910.68] involved the brain
[2907.28 - 2913.60] is a least scanned so I believe that
[2910.68 - 2915.68] going forward the future of your pet
[2913.60 - 2919.68] scans of the
[2915.68 - 2920.40] brain the biochemistry of the blood test
[2919.68 - 2922.92] the
[2920.40 - 2926.72] neurotransmitter detection in diagnostic
[2922.92 - 2929.20] test and your gut microbiome which eats
[2926.72 - 2931.36] the food and dumps molecules back into
[2929.20 - 2934.72] your blood which go and affect your
[2931.36 - 2937.88] brain are all going to be your
[2934.72 - 2940.36] technologically um uh researched or
[2937.88 - 2943.32] diagnosed things and then you'll get
[2940.36 - 2946.36] like I get that opinion so what I did 20
[2943.32 - 2948.40] years ago was organize the dietetics and
[2946.36 - 2950.72] nutrition space where everyone said to
[2948.40 - 2953.00] idly to S to Dosa I started with blood
[2950.72 - 2955.60] test genetic Test new your profession
[2953.00 - 2957.72] will go on that in that line so if if I
[2955.60 - 2959.96] were you and you were a team of people
[2957.72 - 2962.76] uh start looking at what Dr Daniel aan
[2959.96 - 2966.04] is doing in the US uh a lot in terms of
[2962.76 - 2967.40] scan so patient like oh alcohol does
[2966.04 - 2969.44] that to your brain
[2967.40 - 2972.32] even one glass of alcohol yes that's
[2969.44 - 2974.48] your brain people stop drinking but when
[2972.32 - 2976.36] you say stop drinking or I say stop
[2974.48 - 2978.12] drinking nobody believes us because they
[2976.36 - 2980.80] can't see it so technology is going to
[2978.12 - 2984.60] help your pro profession have the tools
[2980.80 - 2987.08] to go boom in your face follow my
[2984.60 - 2989.20] plan next
[2987.08 - 2991.36] question yes ma'am the lady behind and
[2989.20 - 2995.36] then sir you up there anybody else
[2991.36 - 2998.20] questions my time is up anyone wants to

[3006.64 - 3011.16] way you will live you would ladies one
[3009.80 - 3013.64] thing that I would tell all the ladies
[3011.16 - 3014.52] in this room smoking and alcohol affects
[3013.64 - 3016.96] your
[3014.52 - 3019.20] fertility if there is a fertility doctor
[3016.96 - 3020.36] in this room she will be able to tell
[3019.20 - 3023.56] you point

[3025.36 - 3030.68] yes young man right there at the you
[3026.92 - 3032.48] raiseed your hand uh sir I am from AA
[3030.68 - 3035.16] background I just want to ask you
[3032.48 - 3038.12] regarding diabetes in today's s we have
[3035.16 - 3040.44] something called CGM unit CGM sensors so
[3038.12 - 3042.76] are the CGM really useful for we
[3040.44 - 3045.24] dietitians because when I applied the
[3042.76 - 3047.08] CGM units to my patients they get very
[3045.24 - 3050.16] excited very hyper after eating such
[3047.08 - 3052.60] food that my sugar level suddenly SP 300
[3050.16 - 3055.08] and then I need to explain them about
[3052.60 - 3056.84] glycemic index and glycemic load what is
[3055.08 - 3059.64] actual difference between them so what
[3056.84 - 3062.28] is your opinion that is the CGM sensors
[3059.64 - 3065.20] useful for us or they are increasing our
[3062.28 - 3066.88] load i' I'd like to take a poll here
[3065.20 - 3069.56] because this gentleman is just answered
[3066.88 - 3072.08] his own question how many of you in this
[3069.56 - 3074.48] audience think the CGM which is a
[3072.08 - 3076.32] continuous glucose monitor device placed
[3074.48 - 3078.20] on the arm which is connected to your
[3076.32 - 3080.80] phone which will give you realtime
[3078.20 - 3082.24] reading of your sugar levels and by the
[3080.80 - 3085.44] way I put on one so how many of you
[3082.24 - 3087.56] believe it's going to be like absolutely
[3085.44 - 3089.20] amazing for you and your practice or on
[3087.56 - 3091.60] your body or on your parents please
[3089.20 - 3091.60] raise your
[3092.56 - 3096.52] hands maybe about 10% okay put your
[3095.20 - 3097.88] hands on how many of you think it's not
[3096.52 - 3099.84] going to help your
[3097.88 - 3102.32] practice okay there are a lot of fence
[3099.84 - 3104.76] sitters there another 10 so 80% Fitters
