Shane creado who's a board certified psychiatrist as well as one of the best mind coaches and sleep doctors in the world that I know of in fact he's written a book called Peak sleep performance for athletes and I'm going to be deep diving into the brain and Dr Shane's mind on why he wrote this book so from a perspective of how the brain is going to work hi everyone uh it's great to see you uh you know joining in today brain health this morning if you're joining in we are going to be talking about brain health and sleep so good morning everyone uh rates good morning sanjie good morning Swami good morning hey everyone did you sleep well I got 8 hours of sleep last night woke up at 5:30 in the morning and did 20 minutes of Deep deep breathing with some sort of meditation but are you having problems with sleep do you have anxiety do you have depression do you have inability to focus so I'm waiting for Dr Shane from USA to join us he's written the book Peak sleep performance by

clinic which is I have two copies of his book um so one of them I actually marked if I remember correctly it was on see this is what I wanted to read to everyone gene activity okay a total of 711 genes were distorted in their activity caused by a lack of sleep about half of the genes were actually increased in their um about half of the genes were actually increased in the activity whilst the other half were decreased the genes that were Switched Off by a lack of sleep were genes associated with the immune system which means cough cold fever always falling sick is actually activated by lack of sleep and today's world brain health day if you're just joining in so um I'm going to see me and it's loading right now so World brain health day Dr Shane good evening to you I hope the weather in USA is really good good morning to you Ryan it's a pleasure to be here with you once again the weather is great in Chicago right now it's summertime and it's been nice and sunny all day for those who just joining in Dr Shane is a board certified psychiatrist uh and in my opinion he's one of the best sleep doctors in the world because he helps athletes achieve Peak Performance Dr Shane I just saw you at Wimbleton and you were intering at Wimbledon how was the experience it was incredible Ryan I was at Wimbledon this past couple of weeks ago and then at the the PGA Tour Europe in Scotland as well because I work with the PGA as well as some tennis players it was just amazing to go behind the scenes and look at all these Elite tennis players and see their practices and gave one of my books to Novak's team as well Mike Brian I've worked with him for a while and he's been fantastic he he loves the work that I do I helped him with his sleep as well so he said hey why don't you join me to wimble and it was just an such a privilege and a great blessing to be a a part of that Holy experience hopefully next time you can join me I think I will I will join you next time and you know today's world brain health day let's start off at few simple questions why the brain is the most important organ in the human body you know as as a doctor you study the brain better than most of us and you actually treat people based on um you know their deficiencies in the brain and now you've written this book called Peak sleep performance for athletes now both me and you deal with high performing individuals which are athletes celebrities rock stars millionaires billionaires and they pay a lot of focus on their brain health so why the brain why should everyone watching in today on this Live begin to start not with a weight loss program not begin to start with a fat burner why should they focus first on the brain the brain is a command center right it it determines everything we do and if the brain isn't healthy we're not healthy and if our body is not healthy our brain is not healthy so as you know I worked with Doctor Daniel Layman and we do the brain spec images and we know all the risk factors for brain health and your role is indispensable when it comes to brain health because if your body isn't healthy if you're not getting the right nutrition your brain isn't going to function well we talk about the brain and neurotransmitters we talk about the fact that guess what the gut produces 75% of those neurotransmitters ration gut the gut produces 75% of those neurotransmitters so whoever's eaten whoever's eaten bad on the weekend is going to have a crappy Monday morning technically 100% I wonder how many of our listeners today are having a crappy Monday morning because their nutrition wasn't right and that leads into good quality sleep as well so the gut and the brain that gut brain axis is so critical for every one of the folks we work with as you rightly said whether they're billionaires or regular stay-at-home moms or whether they're Elite athletes the gut needs to work right you're fueling your brain as Dr Daniel says would you put sugar in the gas tank of your Ferrari well you're worth more than a Ferrari why would you do that with your own brain awesome awesome so we've understood that the neurotransmitter because the brain chemistry is really really important so for from my perspective over here um I wanted to know when you talk about sleep do we need to go to sleep early because in your in your book you talk about the importance of sleep right and I really love your book because I keep it in my counseling room and I quote it to athletes and then there's this great one where there's a lack of sleep and Tennis accuracy shots go down by 9.2% so somebody asked us a question just now live is it okay if I get 8 hours of sleep but any time of the the day like you know these are call center workers and people um who probably will not go to bed at 9:00 at night or 10:00 at night so from from that perspective yeah so it goes into timing of sleep and the amount of sleep and the quality of sleep each of those individual things need to come together so the timing of sleep you can't help it if you're a shift worker if you're working at a call center strange hours but what you can do is lock in the other two aspects of sleep if the timing is messed up the amount of sleep that you're getting and the quality of that sleep so if you're waking up refreshed a okay if you're not waking up refreshed it's not normal a lot of people think it's a norm to not wake up refresh that's a problem so how many hours of sleep do you need let's dispel the notion of hours of sleep let's think about sleep cycles sleep cyle what what are sleep cycles doctor sleep cycles are well deep sleep and dream sleep together you cycle through deep and dream sleep it's usually 90 minutes so if I have five cycles of 90 minutes each that's s and a half hours in a night for an average adult like me I'm not an elite athlete training for six or eight hours each day s and a half hours of good quality sleep is my sweet spot so are you saying are you saying that athletes and sorry to keep interrupting you because there so many questions coming off on my platform are you saying that the athletes need more sleep than the common person like you and me% and but but they all sleeping seven and eight hours like us normal people I want how how many of them qualifi to the Paris Olympics then this year and so they need to sleep more 100% 100% because the so coming back to your two cycles the sleep and dream and you went five Cycles please continue on that so five cycles of sleep is Right 7 and a half hours of sleep a lot of my athletes that went to Paris this year they're getting you know seven eight cycles of of of sleep which is around 9 and a half 10 10 and a half some some of them 12 hours of sleep in a 24hour period because if you're training for 6 to 8 hours you need that recover recovery sleep it's critical for your recovery your inflammation reduction your reaction times your brain to flush out the toxins it build up while we're awake all this is super important kids kids need more sleep and Adolescence and on average need around nine hours of sleep 1% of the population may need six hours or less of sleep so some people say I can get away with just five hours of sleep four hours of sleep I'm good if you're in the 1% of the population God bless you lucky you great but 99% chance you're not in that 1% wonderful so um when we're talking about this um in in terms of anxiety I recently read a study saying that somewhere in prisons uh they gave the prisoners more amount of omega3 and a multivitamin uh specifically the B complexes so I was just reading up on how the MTHFR Gene when there's a lack of methy folate it's a Cascade effect into depression anxiety so when I hear people or read on the newspaper that so and so so and so jumped out of a balcony or committed suicide or students under so much of pressure I'm scratching my head and thinking could it be that there's a nutritional deficiency could it be that you're not sleeping enough and therefore slamming your brain and not getting the necessary Rejuvenation so what's your opinion as a board certified psychiatrist you're 100% right Ryan so as we mentioned earlier the gut and the neurotransmitters the gut needs to remain healthy the four most important bacteria in the gut produce a large amount of the B vitamins that's why pregnant women are given B vitamins growing children are given B vitamins now vitamin D is needed by these bacteria to produce vitamin the B vitamin so vitamin D is critical for brain health and the B vitamins are critical for nervous system development namely brain spinal cord nerves and also some of the B vitamins are needed for your body to make serotonin adrenaline and dopamine so if you're lacking the B vitamins or your gut is imbalanced with unhealthy bacteria how will you produce enough B vitamins which are needed for nervous system brain development as well as blood cell development for delivering oxygen to the vital organs like the brain and the Heart critically important so you know I work with a lot of CEOs CFOs business people and all uh does you know you mentioned 1% of the population sleeps 5 hours or lesser and all and they're like bragging about it and all and so we see that some of these rich people like I can get by with four hours of sleep especially you guys doctors you'll go through Medical College thinking you can sleep on four and five hours I'm sure you when you meet your classmates uh you know you have you have to like tell them dude you need more sleep but um does this sleep deprivation uh influence the brain's reward system and decision making process 100% And many different ways this happens so we know that on the brain scans with the m clinics when you get less sleep the frontal loes don't work properly they kind of shut down well what is they do they help us with decision making rational decisions suppressing impulsive or irrational rash decisions they help us with motivation Drive Joy pleasure social connectedness they're kind of like the breaks of the brain as well so they put the breaks on the emotional overreactions and they also help us with processing speed how quickly your brain assimilates information processes that information your ability to sustain attention multitask higher level executive functioning so essentially with sleep deprivation your dopamine levels drop your brain thinks it's going into survival mode or danger mode your brain will essentially be emotionally hijacked and you'll be more reactive less responsive so as a CEO as a high functioning individual as an elite athlete it's like a chess game right you're not going to be on top of your game when your frontal lobe is shutting down with less dopamine and then with less dopamine you're going to want to fuel that dopamine in other unhealthy ways that's why sleep deprivation has also been shown to be associated with addiction relapses food cravings and then you'll run to the sugar because that's as addictive more addictive than Co according to a study wow that's right you know in your book in your book you wrote one part which kind of set with me which was um uh if you have a night of bad sleep um there's a part of your brain where up to 40% of your uh reasoning or processing power decision making goes down so now whenever I have to sit on my board meetings and go through multiple department meetings I make sure I switch off Netflix I make sure I go to sleep early because I have to be in that meeting for 8 n hours continuously focused you know and so it's very important but Dr Shane are there any stories that you have without taking names of where you have changed the athletes Behavior or your clients behavior and you have seen um an absolute change in their personality or character because you're focused on sleep example is examples Ryan um one one example that that really stood out to me was this uh guy who was having a night eating disorder so his uh wife wanted to divorce him because every night he was eating he was wasn't aware he was asleep he was going to the kitchen eating a bunch of food making a terrible mess the food in the bed food crumbs between the kitchen and the bedroom she's waking up with curry and food in the bed and she's like I'm done with this this is bad this has to stop and this guy had severe anxiety and PTSD he had been in a war zone and so he had horrible nightmares he was snoring he was in his early 40s and I said well you know he's a young guy he's not fat but I still want to Des him for sleep apnea so Des him for sleep apneia he was stopping breathing 108 times an hour wow really s sleep apnea right and we know that sleep apnea your brains cannot get enough oxygen it goes into anxiety mode that triggers anxiety and waking up out of deep sleep that can result in sleep eating so I said let's first treat the sleep apnea properly we know what it is let's get a good seat PA machine Let's get the right pressures going let's resolve that as a first step you know what happened he stopped night eating his marriage was saved wow he lost 40 lb 40 lb of weight reduction within 8 weeks because he wasn't 0 thing anymore because every yeah you're saying that people who are not losing weight is also related to sleep oh 100% that's so important in your work as well right so the brain thinks for every four hours of sleep that you don't get your brain thinks it needs to eat 900 more calories say that again say that again we got to clip this for every four hours of sleep hours of less sleep that you get your brain thinks it needs 900 more calories to consume that so that would explain why sometimes I've got the perfect diet to my clients but they're not losing weight because I've gone on a calorie deficit diet but the next day the body just telling them you need to eat 900 calories more exactly and even if they're on a ketogenic diet there a good reason why you need carb cycling in some folks right I mean you're the expert in this area but the hormones are The Gatekeepers of the cells so if your sleep isn't optimized your brain will body will go into survival mode survival mode means more stress hormone cortisol cortisol will start storing everything is fat and we know our fat cells convert testosterone to estrogen so instead of building muscle you're losing muscle and building fat with the healthy diets you may lay out for your clients so leptin which suppresses appetite goes down gin which makes you hungrier goes up testosterone which builds muscle goes down cortisol which builds fat goes up wow wow so that was technical so for the lay man out there listening both certified psychiatrist and sleep coaching doctor has said this for four hours of left lesser sleep you need 900 calories your body consumes 900 calories more and that's where you're not being able to lose weight so I think this goes out to all the women out there um who are you know on social media into late night Netflix and stuff like that and speaking of the elephant in the room for children and for even you and me uh social media Netflix um is it correlated to the modern day ages mental health issues um are you seeing a relationship of children uh not being able able to perform well because they're just hooked onto social media and one is the hooking to social media and the other is social media eating away your sleep time there are two departments so like for my son I kind of try and limit his interaction on uh the internet as much as possible to 1 hour one and a half hour a day at 11 years of age but tell us as parents tell us as individuals how much do we need to do a digital detox on a daily basis oh that that is crucial Ryan a digital detox because people only think about oh light exposure but it's way more than that there was a really good documentary called the social dilemma which tells us about how social media essentially hijacks your brain and especially the youth are the most vulnerable people like you know I got my first cell phone when I was 18 years years old it had a little digital screen like a dig digital watch years later I had a duck screen and all this fancy stuff social media wasn't a thing even this Instagram that were're on I didn't have it a few years ago but now the kids the teenagers adolescence all are on social media so one thing is is that it's designed to hook us in with that hit of immediate gratification the dopamine hit pleasure pleasure pleasure press the button it's like a gambling thing the same principles for gambling addiction apply to social media addiction and that's a big problem because you can constantly need that high and crave that and you go back to the social media then you start taking things literally not only that is going to mess with your sleep the other factor is because we're looking for this external validation constantly oh this person has such a great life this person you don't know how miserable they really are they're showing it because because they want that ego boost they want that external validation to say oh this I know some people are liking my post so obviously I I have a good life although I'm miserable so if you're relying too much on external validation external bow if you will what's going to happen is that where is that internal sense going to develop how will you develop internally then you're going to be like a feather in the wind or someone says something bad to you it's going to affect you terribly someone says something good to you you'll believe them then you'll be surrounded by yes people who only don't want to say anything negative to you and you'll kind of go down the wrong path instead of self- learning growth purpose meaning you'll be focusing only on the immediate gratification of external validation and that's not going to promote growth or self-discovery and self-development okay um there are a lot of questions coming in and uh rudra and prates different people are asking even Rashi is asking how to sleep peacefully without any nightmares or any thoughts so when we close our eyes uh then we are stressed out about yeah this happened today and I also face it a lot of times especially when um the the week I've not been able to um get forward Shane who is a sleep specialist and all of us all Ryan Fernando's fans and Instagram live followers right now um we we're counseling with Dr Shane and we ask Dr Shane Dr Shane give us a perfect schedule give us some tips of what we should be doing um to get better sleep and have better brain health 100% so peaceful sleep huh that that's a a lofty goal Marcus Aurelius the famous stoic used to manage the Empire of Rome and then go back to his Chambers but he wouldn't go to sleep immediately Ryan he would have what you know we could now in today's terms call a daily download he would chill out sit down think about the days happenings and I learned this this trick from you know feder's Roger feder's mindset after a point where he won or lost it here's a 15sec Rule 5 Seconds he'll take think about how that point went if you lost it or a terrible lost it no problem 5 Seconds of I'm now in the present moment that's that's dead and the next 5 seconds is planning for the next point so remaining in the moment there's an ancient saying that says if you're stuck in the past you're depressed if you're worried about the future you're anxious but if you're in the present moment you're at peace and we have busy brains busy lives we're always on our phones there's no time for us to process all the information that's been hitting us all day so unfortunately when we're lying in bed that's the only time we're not on our gadgets hopefully that's when all the stuff cut starts coming to the surface so the first rule is your brain is not a light bulb it's not going to switch off immediately when you wanted to so spend 30 to 60 minutes before your bedtime writing down your Worry List from that day maybe journaling writing down your Todo list for the next day so you're not thinking about those things are I'll forget this or that in bed so meditation is key for calming the nervous system down yoga Nitra is amazing as well for that purpose so have a nice winding down routine where there journaling your to-do list your Worry List meditation a warm shower dim lights no activating stressful conversations with your wife or no stressful interactions or don't put on the news if you're look looking at bad news and most of the time it's sensationalist anyway so why bother with that it's not an emergency there's no Cyclone coming to your doorstep every night so if you have a nice winding down routine your brain will start saying okay I'm supposed to be getting ready for sleep time protect your sleep time as a mini vacation every single night could you repeat that protect your sleep time as a mini vacation every night exact what do you mean by that I mean that people want to plan vacations one year in advance six month months in advance look forward to your sleep time from the time you wake up that is your many vacation it you need to protect it as your mini vacation each 24-hour period I'm going to start doing that from to I'm going to start doing that today I'm like yeah I'm getting on my vacation I'm going to go to sleep at 10 o'cl tonight so um see speaking of taking a mini vacation so can the brain get any benefits by engaging in any new cognitive activity or challenging activities like maybe learning a new language or playing a musical instrument 100% so challenging the brain putting it out of its comfort zone stimulates brain development what we call neuroplasticity now we see this in speech therapy we see this in physiotherapy as well if someone is at a stroke we're stimulating different areas of the brain to take up different tasks research has shown there's a part of the brain called the anterior mid singulate gyrus which increases in size the more challenging tasks you're engaging in now the normal thing we do is avoid anything that's challenging we avoid stressful things we avoid things that are difficult to do we want the easiest way forward but that doesn't stimulate brain growth people always say brain is a muscle so you think you're going to build muscle and and become an elite athlete by sitting on the couch eating potato fries no that's that's so true you know we need to challenge the brain and get it to somewhere that's the one you said is take a mini vacation another advice is challenge your brain um maybe have some car yeah simple ways to challenge your brain right Ryan so I can drive to work the same way each day or I can try a different route why use your GPS when when you may have a good sense of where a place might be don't use your GPS that day find a different route to to work maybe try and find something new each day have what you might call a nightly treasure hunt before going to bed think about something unique that happened that day or try and remember a sequence of events or decide you want to walk around your neighborhood and find a store or a coffee shop you haven't seen before stimulating your brain in different ways strengthens the neuronal connections and stimulates different neural networks so basically um somebody just asked this question sir I experience pain in the head after eating sugar so the head is your department so any inputs on whether when somebody's eating sugar I mean the first thing I would say is don't eat it because your brain is telling you not to eat it but what do you think as a doctor you're right right and you know this better than I do you're you're you're a world renown nutritionist that's sugar is toxic to the brains and whether it's just plain sugar or whether it's candy with colors that may be adversely affecting our brain we know that some folks are more sensitive than others to certain things so if you're even more sensitive to sugar and you have a headache migraines are a form of you know the nervous system going into overdrive or inflammation triggering those the sensitive nerve endings it's a sign that you might be more sensitive to sugar than the average person and you're right listen to your brain it's telling you what's right and what's wrong for it you know both of us were cricketers and you were at the other end and I was on the other side batting I would say that come up to you and say Dr Shane um you know maybe also uh you know certain people are allergic like if I drink sugar can juice my sinuses get clogged my sinuses get clogged it puts pressure on the back of my eyeballs so a food allergy test sometimes helps people people and the source of sugar could also be the trigger sugar in itself is the the the glucose Spike that that arrives with that the brain might just not be able to be one of those brains that handle a heavy load but um speaking of foods um do you advise people to avoid any foods before bedtime yes so typically a rule of thumb is avoid any meals 2 hours or or close closer to bedtime only because some people say 3 hours I say 2 hours only because it takes time to digest the food when your body is digesting food your heart rate goes up more blood flow goes to the gut if your heart rate is elevated if your body temperature is elevated it's harder for your body to come down and fall fall asleep that's one another thing is if you're eating too close to bedtime and you're lying down you might have some reflux and it might cause some heartburn and difficulty falling sleep always important not to eat too far from Bedtime either otherwise in the middle of the night your blood sugar will go down and then you'll need more stress hormone cortisol to get the glycogen out of the muscles to produce more glucose so it may wake you up in the middle of the night if you've eaten too far from Bedtime avoid fatty foods before bedtime because it's difficult to digest those you might have discomfort avoid fast carbs because it's it's going to cause that Sugar Spike that we mentioned and then a sugar crash in the middle of the night so good thing to do is eat two or three hours before your desired bedtime maybe some slow carbs kombucha maybe some protein good balance of slow carbs and protein and greens is usually the best course of action awesome so doctor you practice with the world-renowned psychiatrist Dr Daniel aan in the US and he's made this famous where he actually takes brain scans of people people who are caffeine addicts alcohol addicts um you know the the drugs of cocaine marijana and they show that the scans have holes in the brain now what are they what are the reasons the brain gets these holes um I mean I want the public to understand that you mean my terminology you're literally giving a tough part to the brain yeah so a slap so um when you see clients or patients like for example the question that just popped up as I'm talking to you with this question about holes in the brain insomnia is a massive problem for a lot of people they don't get good sleep could it be that they're slapping the brain and the brain's therefore refusing to shut down 100% so the spec images that we do at a in clinics so single Photon emission computed tomography a fancy way of saying we're looking at blood flow and activity so CTS MRIs look at a picture of the brain here we look at how much blood flow and activity is going on in different areas so I have to swallow some sort of dye or something or inject some dye to see it inject some dye and it's taken up by the brain cells and then the Imaging equipment the brain cells they take up the D they release light particles that are captured by the equipment and based on how much light is released it tells us how active those areas are and know we do it only in clinical conditions or even normal people do it everyone does it people who have clinical conditions they want to know if they have ADHD if they have depression anxiety what kind of depression what kind of anxiety brain injuries traumatic brain injuries contact Sports and then people who just want to see how healthy their brain is if they had risk for developing Dementia in a few years or not or they just want to just be on top of their game and make sure they're getting their brain health right so you can look at the brain and kind of predict that someone might get dementia yeah 20 20 years before 30 years before Oh So my grandmother had dementia so maybe in my 50s I want to do a break scan and see if there's a detrition that's what you're saying I could do that 100% come on is this is this is this available in India it is well there spec Imaging is available in India and you know you can scan various organs but unfortunately Aman clinics does not have a branch in India so we have tons of of folks coming through from India as well getting the brain scans and you know we can a lot of people want to do it they they have podcasts and they have their own TV shows and we do it for them as well so if any chance next time in us let me know beforehand I'll schedule to get a brain scan and we can even do one of these lives again we'll do live my brain is getting scan uh a few more questions before I let you get off to your deep sleep and your dream cycle exercise variables you know I remember I did a podcast with you and you told me that they're not very accurate on sleep tracking your sleep Rings the the variables um just dive in that what is the benefit if I use a sleep tracker and uh what is the benefit of not using a sleep tracker give us both sides of the point absolutely so one thing to remember is if you're using a sleep tracker don't obsess over it don't try and say oh my God it said I got this much dream sleep this much light sleep this much deep sleep so only so little deep sleep no those numbers don't matter in the greatest scheme of things because it's not accurate is a total measure of Total Sleep sure you can say Okay Chell I'm going to see how my sleep is trending over the course of the next week but as individual measures not a good idea total measure yes various variables you have the Apple watch you have Fitbit you have Aura ring a whoop all sorts of things right now the aura ring seems to be the most accurate one but not that accurate anyway so okay is a rough measure that's the the the long and short of it a lot of people don't have the wearables they don't want to spend tens of thousands of rupees on a Tracker no problem you don't really need one some folks just want to fill out a sleep diary to track their sleep so in the morning you wake up have it by a bedside write down what time you decided to go to sleep get into bed and then what time you think you fell asleep and what time you woke up in the morning and you know I always tell my folks well did you wake up in the middle of the night hi yeah I woke up at 2: in the morning then I woke up at 3: but I'm like you're not supposed to look at your watch how did you know exactly what time you were waking up because if you're looking at your watch you're worry right it's going to stress you out you won't be able to fall back back asleep so trying to sleep is the best way to wake your brain up and prevent yourself from falling back asleep I think I think that's very valuable advice um uh to use the tracker on an overall perspective I use the gabit ring in India and the overall perspective over here is that it kind of gives me the total volume of sleep but it also kind of tells me to go to sleep every day between 10: and 10:15 and the moment I start getting to 10:15 I'm like okay time to sleep time to sleep time to sleep but earlier when I didn't have the tracker I didn't like I can I I'll push it to 6:45 6 hours 45 7 hours there are quite a few more questions but I'm going to let you go shortly um one of the questions that came is and I think a lot of people do does music listening at bedtime increase Lou sleep and we so I'm adding my question to it now on top of this this came from Shirin and she's asked this question and then over on up my question that is which type of music should I listen to and which type of music I should not listen to before going to sleep okay this is a great question because there are certain sound waves and frequencies that are coming to the nervous system so binaural beats is very commonly used for this purpose binaural beats are unique sequence of sounds that have promote calming of the nervous system that's fine some folks like classical music some folks like Gregorian chanting to calm the nervous system down it really depends on what music works best for you ideally you don't want to listen to you know heavy metal or EDM or something like that that's going to pump you up that's going to make you excited if you want something soothing it's going to vary now some now so songs and music are the soundtrack of our lives so if you have a song that's going to remind you of some horrible relationship breakup or something like that avoid that you don't want to cry and go to sleep in a negative mindset because that might trigger nightmares right as we spoke about there that's that's each to their own each to their own um I recently started playing something known as a hang drum and um I bought one and I was playing it and I found it very therapeutic and then I turned it upside down I saw that 432 Hertz was written on it that is that is the the frequency of of heaven right that is where all the bells were back in the' Lost Dr Shane yeah yeah you're back you're back you were talking you broke off at that was where the bells were made in the past and you the bells were supposed to resonate at 4:30 22 Herz that's the golden frequency that's the range that's healing range that's the therapeutic calming range I've started I've started deep breathing and we started playing 432 Hertz and I just find that I recently and this is not scientific but this is my personal experience I did a heavyweight training workout on legs and I hate legs like most people and so after finishing about seven sets of leg press uh which was twice my body weight um I couldn't walk after that my trainer is like you're going to cry tomorrow with domes and so I went back and we did this deep breathing session with 432 htz music uh pulsating electromagnetic frequency sleeping through the night and a lot of pineapple and glutamine and trust me next next 48 hours I was searching for soness so why am I sharing this with you is Shane I think a combination of diet and nutrition are the two great greatest Elixir for your brain you know and and um Dr Shane if people want to reach out to you and want to to find you or want to get your book which is Peak sleep performance for athletes uh how can we reach out to you obviously everyone can reach out to Ryan Fernando and Ryan Fernando will get you a direct line to Dr Shane CR we good friends now uh but if people want to find you follow you where can they go and reach you Peak sleep performance is my Instagram my website is Shan creator.com and the book Peaks sleep performances available on Amazon and Kindle and I'm at your service I'm ready to to help out with anyone who needs to optimize their sleep to improve their brain health their nutrition goals their weight loss goals and I'm so grateful for this time as always Ryan because you're an inspiration to me and a good reminder that I need to be on top of my nutrition game because the gut fuels your brain and your sleep it's very true I think Shane you're much younger than me and if I could get back to your age the one thing that I would tell myself is our profession has an occupation Hazard and a very good occupation has it is people judge us right uh from the way we sleep the way we eat the way we think uh and everything else so um it's awesome uh we we'll Jam again soon uh I'll let you go and get your uh sweet dream sleeps deep sleep by the way would you be watching any blue light after this is your orange filter on right now on your phone the filter is on before I let you go you got so much of valuable information is this true about the blue light affecting us and and and triggering us before going to sleep yes so and I can spend as much time as you need ran I I love doing these with you it's an absolute honor to to be with you as always so when we think about blue light any light affects or suppresses our melatonin which makes it harder for you to fall asleep we're most sensitive to blue light but red light doesn't affect us isn't that beautiful the way we are created because red light Sunset you know it's not going to affect our melatonin anyway melatonin can rise normally so we're more sensitive to Blue Light so blue light filters can help to some degree blue light blocking glasses can help to some degree but not completely that's why I always advise folks you know dim the lights an hour before bedtime even at home don't have bright fluorescent lights till late at night even if you're on the screen dim the lights calming environment there's a good reason people had candles back in the old days you know and then when you're waking up get some sunlight on your face feel sorry but I have my light on at home no that's maybe you know 5,000 Lux but the sunlight is 100,000 luxs that's what we need to regulate and lock in your circadian rhythm awesome Dr Shane it's a pleasure when you're next when you're next in here to let me know we'll do a live at the city that you're in and we'll do it in person where everyone can come

who's written the book Peak sleep performance for athletes and Dr Shane practices in Chicago uh at the D Dr Daniel aan clinics he's a world-renowned psychologist but this book um has changed my counseling because you know I always tell athletes that um you know I'm going to give you an amazing diet but if your sleep is lousy then your brain no matter how perfect your diet is is at some point going to slap you uh so it's a combination of you can't outrun a bad diet which is the exercise part so people think they can eat whatever they want and then exercise it so you can't outrun a bad diet and you can't um undersleep a very fantastic diet so you've got to get your sleep and as I say always your body is the most expensive real estate I've got many questions on the diet Forum coming in
