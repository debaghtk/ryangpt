[406.40 - 410.96] it's really good especially for the kids
[408.48 - 413.20] and the elderly population because they
[410.96 - 414.88] are most prone to the effects of
[413.20 - 417.36] pollution now if you cannot afford a
[414.88 - 419.48] yoga coach please learn to do the basic

[425.84 - 429.92] home throw out all the flam and mucus as
[427.96 - 431.72] soon as you come back try to cough out
[429.92 - 434.08] this mucus because the pollution is
[431.72 - 435.76] caught in that mucus do a warm water
[434.08 - 438.12] solid gargle immediately when you come
[435.76 - 440.32] from outside do a j3 before going to bed
[438.12 - 442.72] or a salt water uh circulation in your
[440.32 - 444.76] nose this will help in removing the
[442.72 - 447.64] pollution out of your throat and your
[444.76 - 449.76] nose do warm water inhalations before
[447.64 - 454.00] going to bed because the steam will keep
[449.76 - 454.00] your lungs better and softer for health
