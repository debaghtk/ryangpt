[149.92 - 154.84] thank you so much Ryan absolutely
[151.80 - 157.08] delighted to be here um AT AP poo
[154.84 - 160.76] hospitals as uh heading the preventive
[157.08 - 164.08] Health vertical um my mandate is to help
[160.76 - 164.88] shift the consumer mindset from Curative
[164.08 - 167.84] to
[164.88 - 170.80] preventive and uh I bring sort of deep
[167.84 - 173.56] passion for driving consumer Behavior
[170.80 - 175.88] change um and I think that's the Crux of
[173.56 - 178.08] uh changes to Lifestyle the only thing
[175.88 - 180.96] that we can control if we want to be
[178.08 - 183.56] healthier tomorrow than we are today you
[180.96 - 186.24] know whenever we have conversations in
[183.56 - 189.64] the corridor everyone's talking about
[186.24 - 192.20] how India is the seat of ancient wisdom
[189.64 - 194.56] we discovered the zero over here
[192.20 - 197.76] mathematics center of the world and
[194.56 - 201.64] obviously the AIC Sciences are thousands
[197.76 - 203.52] of years old and so I'm assuming that
[201.64 - 207.08] this ancient wisdom would have trickled
[203.52 - 209.28] down into our subsequent Generations
[207.08 - 210.48] what we're noticing is that we are
[209.28 - 213.12] getting aot lot of these
[210.48 - 214.68] non-communicable diseases in the ancient
[213.12 - 217.68] time we had diseases that killed us
[214.68 - 220.24] because of typhoid or malaria but now
[217.68 - 223.12] we're getting rammed by stuff like
[220.24 - 227.56] diabetes and hypertension and heart
[223.12 - 229.60] attacks so is this on the rise and what
[227.56 - 233.16] do you think doctor went wrong since
[229.60 - 236.08] ancient wisdom and now modern
[233.16 - 238.84] sickness Ryan the non-communicable
[236.08 - 243.32] diseases which um typically cover
[238.84 - 245.08] diabetes hyper ention cancers um obesity
[243.32 - 248.40] as well as now increasingly mental
[245.08 - 251.32] health are definitely on the Rise um if
[248.40 - 256.52] we take uh the Indian population back in
[251.32 - 258.48] 1990 so as recent as 1990 25% of the
[256.52 - 261.44] debts in the country were due to the
[258.48 - 265.00] ncds or non-communicable disas 25% that
[261.44 - 268.16] means 1/4 of our population was dying
[265.00 - 268.16] because they were slapping their own
[268.20 - 272.08] selves yes kind of
[270.32 - 273.92] I I couldn't get it from my next door
[272.08 - 275.84] neighbor or my auntie or my uncle I
[273.92 - 278.44] brought it upon myself upon ourselves
[275.84 - 282.04] and at that time the infectious diseases
[278.44 - 282.88] uh were about 65% of the uh deaths in
[282.04 - 285.60] the
[282.88 - 288.72] country I think Medical Technology
[285.60 - 290.44] access to vaccines a lot of um awareness
[288.72 - 293.60] about some of the communicable diseases
[290.44 - 296.24] has resulted now in the these diseases
[293.60 - 298.20] going down and the non-communicable
[296.24 - 301.36] diseases on the other hand have been
[298.20 - 304.92] steadily increasing in
[301.36 - 306.44] 2020 65% of the deaths in the country
[304.92 - 310.68] were due to
[306.44 - 312.96] ncds so we've gone from 25% to 65% in
[310.68 - 316.20] 1990 to
[312.96 - 319.32] 2020 so the ancient wisdom of
[316.20 - 322.32] ayura is now just a lovely name plate on
[319.32 - 324.84] our Board of India but internally we're
[322.32 - 327.76] getting sicker and we're not getting
[324.84 - 329.92] sicker because of infectious diseases
[327.76 - 332.16] it's it's these lifestyle diseases
[329.92 - 334.40] that's right I think um just to add on
[332.16 - 337.48] to what you said uh lifestyle changes
[334.40 - 341.52] that we've had in the last 20 OD years
[337.48 - 343.84] rapid urbanization pollution alcohol
[341.52 - 346.92] smoking uh processed
[343.84 - 350.52] food right and uh sedentary
[346.92 - 353.56] lifestyle um while you know we may be
[350.52 - 355.76] aware more about our health today but I
[353.56 - 357.84] don't think it's um in our Behavior it's
[355.76 - 359.88] actually something that we are abiding
[357.84 - 361.76] by so I think all those things things
[359.88 - 364.84] are actually leading to a rapid increase
[361.76 - 368.36] in ncds and seven out of 10 deaths today
[364.84 - 370.32] in in the world happen because of NCS so
[368.36 - 372.04] seven out of 10 deaths in the world
[370.32 - 374.84] happen because of non-communicable
[372.04 - 376.28] diseases which basically is you don't
[374.84 - 379.80] get it from something you kind of
[376.28 - 383.40] inflict it upon yourself so where do we
[379.80 - 385.40] act where do we act do we wait till we
[383.40 - 387.92] get that slap and in your case you're
[385.40 - 390.64] giving me statistics of death so does a
[387.92 - 393.40] person need to wait till they die and
[390.64 - 394.96] then act or I know I'm joking about
[393.40 - 397.32] something about death but people need to
[394.96 - 400.24] wake up and get serious so where do I
[397.32 - 402.76] get serious do I get serious uh at the
[400.24 - 405.96] first sign of a symptom do do I get
[402.76 - 408.00] serious when i faint and fall down so as
[405.96 - 410.32] doctors uh you know practicing this
[408.00 - 412.44] Mantra of not Curative medicine but
[410.32 - 414.32] preventive medicine Where do we start
[412.44 - 417.28] how do we get people to get
[414.32 - 420.08] started if you see a symptom it's
[417.28 - 422.80] already in my mind a tad bit on the
[420.08 - 425.96] later side doctor if I can interrupt you
[422.80 - 429.44] for the lay man out there symptom what
[425.96 - 432.60] do we mean by symptom a symptom is
[429.44 - 434.92] something that you feel is off and that
[432.60 - 438.60] means it could be a pain somewhere a
[434.92 - 441.32] discomfort away from the normal way that
[438.60 - 444.92] something is functioned example you have
[441.32 - 447.28] a pain in the gut area or your digestive
[444.92 - 450.60] processes right and bowel movements are
[447.28 - 453.28] irregular you have pain in the chest
[450.60 - 456.40] area all of these are examples of
[453.28 - 460.56] symptoms something that you can feel
[456.40 - 464.84] visibly see sometimes touch this is what
[460.56 - 466.56] it is is a symptom and when we say you
[464.84 - 468.68] come in after a symptom at that point
[466.56 - 471.88] like I said it's a little bit on the
[468.68 - 475.76] later side our body is actually built to
[471.88 - 479.16] be very very resilient and therefore can
[475.76 - 481.12] compensate for a lot of the abuse is
[479.16 - 483.16] that a lot of us have this god syndrome
[481.12 - 485.48] that we indestructible therefore we
[483.16 - 487.24] ignore the symptom exactly or symptom or
[485.48 - 489.20] the even the path towards that right you
[487.24 - 490.88] sort of start getting a little bit of a
[489.20 - 493.52] niggling feeling you know something is
[490.88 - 495.80] off the sleep is a little bit disturbed
[493.52 - 498.72] but you choose to procrastinate and push
[495.80 - 501.60] it out until it becomes something that's
[498.72 - 504.28] really tangible at that point it's a
[501.60 - 507.72] symptom let's take a
[504.28 - 510.32] example um one of the rising conditions
[507.72 - 513.36] um in India is fatty
[510.32 - 516.04] liver when we think about a liver
[513.36 - 518.24] transplant or liver curosis
[516.04 - 521.56] automatically most of us think about
[518.24 - 523.52] alcohol related liver curosis I drink a
[521.56 - 527.20] lot of alcohol and my liver goes off
[523.52 - 530.12] right our uh liver transplant surgeons
[527.20 - 534.20] say these days for every alcohol related
[530.12 - 537.92] liver transplant they do they do one for
[534.20 - 541.84] non-alcoholic fatty liver conditions ah
[537.92 - 543.36] so what you're trying to say is that
[541.84 - 546.12] just because somebody's smoking or
[543.36 - 548.08] drinking in the previous time we doctors
[546.12 - 549.80] said oh this guy is going to get
[548.08 - 551.52] alcoholic fatty liver disease now you're
[549.80 - 553.64] saying even without drinking they're
[551.52 - 556.88] getting it that's right even without
[553.64 - 558.64] drinking they're getting fatty liver
[556.88 - 561.16] conditions that's different from the
[558.64 - 564.48] alcohol related curosis let's unpack
[561.16 - 567.12] this a little bit more how a liver gets
[564.48 - 570.00] uh becomes a fatty liver is essentially
[567.12 - 573.52] due to excess carbohydrates
[570.00 - 575.92] right because the first place of storage
[573.52 - 578.04] for excess carbohydrate when it's
[575.92 - 581.24] converted into something called glycogen
[578.04 - 585.04] is the liver it's only when the liver's
[581.24 - 587.68] capacity to hold that excess
[585.04 - 590.12] carbohydrates is surpassed does it
[587.68 - 593.56] actually go and settle in other places
[590.12 - 594.48] now when there's excess accumulation of
[593.56 - 596.80] these
[594.48 - 598.28] carbohydrates as glycogen in the liver
[596.80 - 600.64] there are structural changes to the
[598.28 - 603.56] liver and that be only picked up in an
[600.64 - 606.48] ultrasound it will not show up in a
[603.56 - 609.52] blood test or the of the liver function
[606.48 - 611.52] tests that's much much later when the
[609.52 - 614.08] liver has stopped compensating for this
[611.52 - 616.40] and says I give up I give up and that's
[614.08 - 618.72] when the liver function test starts to
[616.40 - 620.56] be abnormal but if you do an ultrasound
[618.72 - 623.16] you can actually pick up the structural
[620.56 - 626.16] changes much earlier doctor for the
[623.16 - 628.96] people that don't know what is this
[626.16 - 631.56] ultrasound yeah ultrasound is actually
[628.96 - 634.84] an IM in technology that uses sound
[631.56 - 637.08] waves to help visualize what's going on
[634.84 - 641.00] inside your body but why would somebody
[637.08 - 642.88] do this so typically we have heard uh
[641.00 - 646.36] doing an ultrasound for pregnancy
[642.88 - 649.28] related yes right look baby in the in
[646.36 - 651.56] the womb and so forth um but what we
[649.28 - 655.00] found is the ultrasound of the abdominal
[651.56 - 658.28] region actually picks up a number of
[655.00 - 661.16] abnormal uh conditions in in this area
[658.28 - 663.20] so stomach gallbladder liver pancreas
[661.16 - 665.36] ovary uterus right all of these get
[663.20 - 667.64] picked up in an ultrasound also you
[665.36 - 670.00] could do an ultrasound of stes for
[667.64 - 671.60] kidney stones gallbladder stones also
[670.00 - 673.52] coted arteries sometimes you do an
[671.60 - 675.40] ultrasound to be able to see where where
[673.52 - 677.20] is the coted AR it's around here in the
[675.40 - 679.20] neck so so the one in the neck that's
[677.20 - 682.36] right why would we screen an ultrasound
[679.20 - 684.92] for the neck cared artery this is for
[682.36 - 687.12] typically for stroke you know but
[684.92 - 688.64] youngsters will be like I'm not going to
[687.12 - 691.48] get a stroke but we're hearing of so
[688.64 - 694.96] many people get stroke nowadays so if I
[691.48 - 695.64] am in the 20s to 30s 30s to 40s or 40s
[694.96 - 700.28] to
[695.64 - 702.16] 50s are we doing this ultrasound or this
[700.28 - 705.72] uh you know the checking of my neck
[702.16 - 707.92] artery and all who tells me to do this
[705.72 - 712.36] yeah so also Ryan you don't do
[707.92 - 715.88] everything for everyone at all ages okay
[712.36 - 719.52] right different uh people have different
[715.88 - 722.72] risk factors different age milestones
[719.52 - 725.60] you actually the in Risk increases so we
[722.72 - 727.44] actually can um think about a
[725.60 - 729.80] combination of tests that are most
[727.44 - 733.16] appropriate for each individual or group
[729.80 - 735.04] of individuals okay got it and if I can
[733.16 - 737.08] add to that you know recently in our Pro
[735.04 - 740.12] Health packages we've launched eight
[737.08 - 742.76] specific packages so um you know the
[740.12 - 745.08] most popular tests that people opt for
[742.76 - 746.92] our whole body packages but essentially
[745.08 - 749.76] that used to be restricted to you know
[746.92 - 752.24] 40 50 60 they used to kind of be more uh
[749.76 - 754.48] you know uh the uptake used to be more
[752.24 - 756.40] in these age this age category but now
[754.48 - 758.48] we' realized that you know as as you
[756.40 - 760.00] said the onset of this disease is also
[758.48 - 762.72] in the younger age group so we've
[760.00 - 766.24] curated packages for our younger age
[762.72 - 768.04] group as well so how young 20 to 40 so a
[766.24 - 770.92] 20year old to 30-year-old can come in
[768.04 - 772.68] and get tested yes yes and we've curated
[770.92 - 774.44] the packages based on the disease
[772.68 - 776.16] conditions that are most prevalent in
[774.44 - 777.72] that age group so we have that's that's
[776.16 - 779.84] very interesting you know recently I was
[777.72 - 781.96] working in one of the fortune 500
[779.84 - 784.60] companies and they contracted us to do
[781.96 - 786.80] the nutrition plans for people and we
[784.60 - 789.08] just asked for a basic blood test of the
[786.80 - 792.24] 20 to 30 year olds and we found that
[789.08 - 796.80] more than 67% of the blood test that we
[792.24 - 799.24] did had very high liid profile yes yes
[796.80 - 801.00] and the the the youngsters were shocked
[799.24 - 803.36] yeah yeah so that's also part of our
[801.00 - 807.16] genetics as South Asian population where
[803.36 - 810.12] we are more prone to higher cholesterol
[807.16 - 813.40] you know what could be some of the
[810.12 - 815.84] modern day reasons that the 20s to 30s
[813.40 - 819.80] and 30s to 40s are facing these current
[815.84 - 822.88] lifestyle diseases what from the air or
[819.80 - 824.88] from the water or from the food or or is
[822.88 - 827.92] it my karma boomi or something that is
[824.88 - 829.72] causing this so as doctors screening
[827.92 - 832.36] thousands of people you are seeing
[829.72 - 833.64] statistics so you obviously are like
[832.36 - 835.56] Sherlock Holmes and you will have an
[833.64 - 837.84] inference what are the modern day
[835.56 - 839.84] conveniences that are putting a Target
[837.84 - 842.60] on people
[839.84 - 844.76] one I think to add to Dr satya's Point
[842.60 - 846.84] genetically we are predisposed to more
[844.76 - 848.40] coronary arteries cardiovascular I can
[846.84 - 850.12] blame my grandfather grandmother but
[848.40 - 852.40] only that's part of the story I would
[850.12 - 854.20] say even in our genetic testing
[852.40 - 857.56] protocols that we have well established
[854.20 - 860.68] in our pro health program uh genetic
[857.56 - 863.48] screening results have shown us that
[860.68 - 864.80] that predisposition causes only 1/4 of
[863.48 - 866.84] the contribution to the overall inness
[864.80 - 869.88] of the person the others are you know
[866.84 - 872.24] your lifestyle like so 25% I blame my
[869.88 - 874.76] ancestry ancestors for that and 75% is
[872.24 - 877.16] my mine which is your you know dietary
[874.76 - 879.80] intake your sedentary lifestyle
[877.16 - 881.16] pollution in there you know uh and the
[879.80 - 883.60] kind of food that I'm eating and of
[881.16 - 886.20] course while we may be aware about our
[883.60 - 889.00] you know Health needs but we are not
[886.20 - 891.24] really uh you know doing much about it
[889.00 - 893.72] uh like we see we are you know more
[891.24 - 895.80] leading a lot of sedentary um lifestyle
[893.72 - 898.44] choices um I think those are
[895.80 - 901.32] contributory factors also Indians
[898.44 - 902.32] genetically are insulin resistant more
[901.32 - 905.08] than
[902.32 - 907.04] Caucasians that leads to you know High
[905.08 - 909.24] predisposition for diabetes and of
[907.04 - 911.36] course uh you know resulting impact on
[909.24 - 912.68] other other organs as well so that I
[911.36 - 914.72] think something we really have to watch
[912.68 - 916.72] out for so Dr Manish what I'm hearing
[914.72 - 919.72] and what all our fans are listening in
[916.72 - 921.32] is that okay at 25% I can blame my
[919.72 - 923.08] family genes I still want to blame my
[921.32 - 925.24] family maybe for my diabetes
[923.08 - 926.20] hypertension catract Yeo all of those
[925.24 - 930.76] things
[926.20 - 933.36] right but as a young adult should I
[930.76 - 936.40] screen when should I screen and what
[933.36 - 939.52] should I screen for for this blaming my
[936.40 - 942.44] family part let's call it
[939.52 - 944.40] genetics so um because I think if I know
[942.44 - 946.80] that I'm going to have something that
[944.40 - 947.84] has a risk factor I'm hoping we are
[946.80 - 951.32] smart
[947.84 - 954.28] enough to say that I inherited it but I
[951.32 - 957.12] won't activate it so what could we be
[954.28 - 959.00] doing uh as tests so Ryan I'm going to
[957.12 - 961.20] share a personal anecdote here I
[959.00 - 964.36] actually did my own genetic
[961.20 - 967.56] sequencing and uh some of the results
[964.36 - 971.04] that U actually stood out for me and
[967.56 - 975.04] made me change my behaviors
[971.04 - 977.28] right um first I realized that I had um
[975.04 - 980.12] higher likelihood of developing
[977.28 - 981.48] hypertension which is blood pressure so
[980.12 - 984.96] that's something that I realized as part
[981.48 - 988.12] of my genetic profile I therefore now
[984.96 - 989.68] regularly take my blood pressure every
[988.12 - 990.88] week
[989.68 - 994.00] now it also helps that I'm in a
[990.88 - 996.72] hypertensive household and everyone goes
[994.00 - 999.88] around passes the BP meter and uh we now
[996.72 - 1002.44] make it a ritual I knock onward don't
[999.88 - 1004.76] have it yet but because that genetic
[1002.44 - 1008.08] sequencing result told me that I'm at a
[1004.76 - 1010.24] higher risk than the average Indian I
[1008.08 - 1013.28] now do this regularly I'm hoping that I
[1010.24 - 1015.76] can catch any Rising Trend so not at any
[1013.28 - 1019.52] given one point but a rising Trend that
[1015.76 - 1022.08] then allows me to um address it well
[1019.52 - 1023.80] before it becomes a problem so you did
[1022.08 - 1026.88] the testing know that you have a
[1023.80 - 1028.72] hypertensive kind of Gene and you're now
[1026.88 - 1030.88] screening with a BP monitor so you're
[1028.72 - 1033.28] you're doing it proactively are you
[1030.88 - 1036.76] changing anything in your life so let me
[1033.28 - 1039.36] give you an example of another Gene that
[1036.76 - 1044.00] uh was identified where apparently I
[1039.36 - 1049.00] have a tendency to add more weight with
[1044.00 - 1053.00] high fat foods ah the minute I saw that
[1049.00 - 1055.52] I had a red or higher than the average
[1053.00 - 1057.28] Indian it's automatically made it
[1055.52 - 1059.40] somewhat tangible for my brain to
[1057.28 - 1062.44] process this as something that's not
[1059.40 - 1065.08] good for me and since then I have been
[1062.44 - 1067.36] watchful so when Dr Satya sees a samosa
[1065.08 - 1069.44] on her plate she's like you're not
[1067.36 - 1073.12] worthy to enter my body right now I
[1069.44 - 1077.12] actually asked am I allowed to enjoy
[1073.12 - 1079.20] that this week so let me rewind slightly
[1077.12 - 1081.16] with you because I want a listeners to
[1079.20 - 1083.32] understand that you're a CEO of AP poloo
[1081.16 - 1085.20] preventive Healthcare and you're making
[1083.32 - 1087.72] changes because you've understood the
[1085.20 - 1091.32] crystal ball gazing into your future
[1087.72 - 1094.68] which is if you were younger did you eat
[1091.32 - 1097.68] a samosa with abandon and now with this
[1094.68 - 1099.52] knowledge is it making you realize that
[1097.68 - 1102.88] your body is the most expensive real
[1099.52 - 1105.48] estate it's not changeable and therefore
[1102.88 - 1107.12] you have to make some changes is is
[1105.48 - 1109.28] there a difference between the younger
[1107.12 - 1111.64] version of you and now the more why iser
[1109.28 - 1115.52] older version of you absolutely I
[1111.64 - 1120.44] actually developed kidney stones oh very
[1115.52 - 1123.24] young okay and uh that was a wakeup call
[1120.44 - 1125.52] for everyone has a wake up call at some
[1123.24 - 1127.88] point in their life and now in my 40s
[1125.52 - 1132.56] the number of things I know I really
[1127.88 - 1135.76] wish someone had uh slapped me awake in
[1132.56 - 1139.00] my 20s and told me the few things that I
[1135.76 - 1140.68] needed to change U so that I could enjoy
[1139.00 - 1143.48] these um
[1140.68 - 1146.32] unscrupulous behaviors every now and
[1143.48 - 1148.68] then and you know I think that brings us
[1146.32 - 1150.28] to the point that 20 years back we
[1148.68 - 1151.76] didn't have the luxury of genetic
[1150.28 - 1155.08] testing
[1151.76 - 1157.88] today's 20 and 30 year olds have that
[1155.08 - 1159.76] luxury and they must use this because
[1157.88 - 1161.68] it's very important to get that tested
[1159.76 - 1163.96] in the early years once the disease
[1161.68 - 1166.36] onset happens you know then you can only
[1163.96 - 1168.04] reverse the disease but if you get the
[1166.36 - 1169.88] testing done in time you can actually
[1168.04 - 1173.08] prevent the oner of diseases you know I
[1169.88 - 1174.88] so much agree with both of you um when
[1173.08 - 1177.04] we studied in our younger years we
[1174.88 - 1179.00] didn't have the access to the internet
[1177.04 - 1182.36] today's generations have technology
[1179.00 - 1183.48] right much smarter generation like um
[1182.36 - 1184.68] you know if you have a laptop that's
[1183.48 - 1187.40] running only at
[1184.68 - 1190.36] 60% you upgrade it to a new laptop that
[1187.40 - 1191.92] runs at 120% so I think this younger
[1190.36 - 1194.32] generation is quite smart and once they
[1191.92 - 1196.96] begin to realize that I can have a
[1194.32 - 1199.60] crystal ball gazing into my Ram
[1196.96 - 1202.16] processing speed or what back foot do I
[1199.60 - 1204.36] have in my body so I also did my Gene
[1202.16 - 1207.04] testing and I discovered that I'm gluten
[1204.36 - 1209.36] intolerant MH I wrote a whole book about
[1207.04 - 1211.92] it called wheatless why because when I
[1209.36 - 1215.72] was a teenager nobody told me that I
[1211.92 - 1220.76] should avoid milk and gluten and so I
[1215.72 - 1222.92] got acne hammering me late into my 30s
[1220.76 - 1225.76] and when I did a gene test that which
[1222.92 - 1227.08] was sent to America many many years ago
[1225.76 - 1230.64] the guy called up from there was
[1227.08 - 1230.64] speaking Hindi and he said by
[1231.96 - 1236.24] so you can't eat bread who told you to
[1234.24 - 1239.72] eat bread but who's going to tell me
[1236.24 - 1242.08] culturally that my dad Ma and my my
[1239.72 - 1246.12] grandfather were at two strong different
[1242.08 - 1248.08] locations so we're done blaming our
[1246.12 - 1251.40] genetics and our parents and our
[1248.08 - 1254.20] grandparents but um if you look at
[1251.40 - 1256.68] statistics from the medical
[1254.20 - 1259.00] industry and I'm sitting on this side of
[1256.68 - 1261.76] the lens what are the life lifestyle
[1259.00 - 1263.60] diseases statistically that as an Indian
[1261.76 - 1266.68] I should be looking at
[1263.60 - 1269.60] for so which is the which is the top G
[1266.68 - 1271.76] Gunda I would say preo the top Gunda was
[1269.60 - 1273.64] you know the cardiovascular diseases so
[1271.76 - 1276.52] cardiovascular for the lay man
[1273.64 - 1280.32] hypertension coronary artery diseases
[1276.52 - 1281.32] you know um blockages artery blockages
[1280.32 - 1283.60] basically everything to do with the
[1281.32 - 1285.84] heart pumping of the heart that was the
[1283.60 - 1289.52] most common postco we've seen a massive
[1285.84 - 1293.20] shift towards cancer lung cancer liver
[1289.52 - 1296.08] cancer um stomach cancer among males and
[1293.20 - 1298.44] in females breast cancer cervical cancer
[1296.08 - 1300.00] and then lung cancer in that order so
[1298.44 - 1302.56] that's what we see most prevalence of
[1300.00 - 1304.44] but also mental health so what is the
[1302.56 - 1306.48] age group of people that come in for the
[1304.44 - 1309.64] preventive Health checkups like broad
[1306.48 - 1313.56] picture as young as what and as old as
[1309.64 - 1315.88] young as 25 as old as I mean there's no
[1313.56 - 1317.36] so if 25-year-old is listening in they
[1315.88 - 1319.68] can actually make the effort to come in
[1317.36 - 1323.08] and get screened and test in everything
[1319.68 - 1325.64] absolutely I think as a habit we have to
[1323.08 - 1327.40] incorporate that early on and as you
[1325.64 - 1329.52] rightly said you know in the early part
[1327.40 - 1331.40] of the show we shouldn't really wait for
[1329.52 - 1333.00] something to happen to us before we take
[1331.40 - 1334.60] that test I mean just think about it we
[1333.00 - 1337.40] get a car service twice a year four
[1334.60 - 1340.12] times a year but I know of many adults
[1337.40 - 1341.88] with strong family history not getting
[1340.12 - 1343.68] themselves tested for you know years
[1341.88 - 1346.84] together which is I think an extremely
[1343.68 - 1349.12] dangerous state to live in you know this
[1346.84 - 1351.64] is just popping up in my head which is
[1349.12 - 1355.24] we get so many people saying that right
[1351.64 - 1357.80] I do not want to know as a medical
[1355.24 - 1360.44] doctor I mean you guys will see the
[1357.80 - 1361.80] worst of the worst right and now you're
[1360.44 - 1364.04] sitting on the side of the fence where
[1361.80 - 1365.96] you're saying if I throw a ball I know
[1364.04 - 1367.80] where it's going to land and this person
[1365.96 - 1371.32] saying I don't want to know where it's
[1367.80 - 1372.68] going to land yes what what do we say to
[1371.32 - 1374.72] such people who are sitting in the fence
[1372.68 - 1377.08] saying I don't want to know I want to
[1374.72 - 1379.40] enjoy my life but then they're hurting
[1377.08 - 1381.76] the whole family after that exactly the
[1379.40 - 1384.28] same thing I'm saying just think about
[1381.76 - 1385.88] the impact and the consequences that
[1384.28 - 1387.84] procrastination is going to have on your
[1385.88 - 1389.92] family to me that was the biggest wakeup
[1387.84 - 1391.64] call many many years back when I started
[1389.92 - 1392.92] regularly doing these health checks
[1391.64 - 1395.00] because you just have one life and
[1392.92 - 1396.48] nothing is going to substitute that you
[1395.00 - 1398.48] can't be replaced you know for your
[1396.48 - 1399.96] family and all there's no replacement so
[1398.48 - 1402.12] just think about that you know think
[1399.96 - 1404.04] about your parents I know so many young
[1402.12 - 1406.44] young men and women who lost their lives
[1404.04 - 1409.20] and today I see their parents really I
[1406.44 - 1412.00] mean not having that closure not you
[1409.20 - 1413.84] know having nobody for support I think
[1412.00 - 1415.84] that's a very sad state to be in for the
[1413.84 - 1417.40] family I think in addition to the loss
[1415.84 - 1421.08] of life it's also the additional
[1417.40 - 1424.64] economic burden on the family so when we
[1421.08 - 1428.28] diagnose something very late there may
[1424.64 - 1430.40] still be treatments available and you
[1428.28 - 1434.32] and your family want to give everything
[1430.40 - 1437.44] a shot before uh saying this is it we've
[1434.32 - 1440.80] tried everything and that costs a lot of
[1437.44 - 1442.88] money what cost L of stress so in
[1440.80 - 1445.56] addition to you know God forbid the loss
[1442.88 - 1448.56] of life it's also this additional
[1445.56 - 1450.60] economic and uh stress burden that
[1448.56 - 1452.36] you're adding to the people around you
[1450.60 - 1454.40] is it true doctor because I was reading
[1452.36 - 1455.76] about these blue zones um around the
[1454.40 - 1459.20] world where people live into the
[1455.76 - 1461.36] hundreds and Japan is one of those areas
[1459.20 - 1463.56] and apparently Japan started the system
[1461.36 - 1466.40] of screening early catching diseases
[1463.56 - 1468.68] early so you know we we pride ourselves
[1466.40 - 1471.12] at Aura and the ancient Tex and all of
[1468.68 - 1474.84] that stuff but we're living so modern
[1471.12 - 1477.84] today what is it that we need to do or
[1474.84 - 1481.28] what does the population need to do in
[1477.84 - 1482.68] terms of lowering their medical cost
[1481.28 - 1486.04] what are the some of the small things
[1482.68 - 1488.12] that they could start doing I think uh
[1486.04 - 1492.44] what's in each of our hands is I'm going
[1488.12 - 1495.72] to say first um really evaluate your
[1492.44 - 1499.08] lifestyle habits and these are around
[1495.72 - 1503.04] what you consume right and that's a diet
[1499.08 - 1506.88] food uh water how much
[1503.04 - 1510.60] alcohol drugs so everything you consume
[1506.88 - 1513.92] second is how much you move so it's not
[1510.60 - 1516.28] just about Fitness strength that's
[1513.92 - 1519.40] important it's also about how much you
[1516.28 - 1522.56] keep moving through the day climb the
[1519.40 - 1525.12] stairs versus taking the elevator walk
[1522.56 - 1528.36] to get your coffee versus expecting it
[1525.12 - 1530.92] to show up at your desk take a walking
[1528.36 - 1533.64] meeting with somebody or a standing
[1530.92 - 1538.32] meeting with a group of people rather
[1533.64 - 1541.72] than continuously sitting the third is
[1538.32 - 1544.84] sleep sleep enough but also watch the
[1541.72 - 1547.40] quality of your sleep to make sure that
[1544.84 - 1548.84] it is restful for you because that's
[1547.40 - 1551.32] when your body actually
[1548.84 - 1553.16] rejuvenates um and your brain has enough
[1551.32 - 1556.32] time to process everything that it's col
[1553.16 - 1559.00] collated through the day the fourth is
[1556.32 - 1562.40] Stress Management
[1559.00 - 1565.04] the problem with stress is that the
[1562.40 - 1567.40] levels of cortisol and adrenaline
[1565.04 - 1570.12] hormones that go
[1567.40 - 1573.32] up it's actually a good thing when it is
[1570.12 - 1575.08] in very short bursts and helps us focus
[1573.32 - 1578.08] and be attentive and actually perform
[1575.08 - 1580.00] much better when it is sustained over a
[1578.08 - 1583.36] long period of time that's called
[1580.00 - 1584.64] chronic stress then the body doesn't
[1583.36 - 1586.64] even have chance to get it back to
[1584.64 - 1588.76] normal levels and that triggers a whole
[1586.64 - 1591.44] bunch of Downstream pathways in your
[1588.76 - 1594.12] body causing everything from indigestion
[1591.44 - 1598.20] to diabetes cardiovascular issues and so
[1594.12 - 1600.80] forth and the last piece is actually a
[1598.20 - 1604.68] community people that you actually
[1600.80 - 1609.32] mindfully engage with in different parts
[1604.68 - 1611.16] of your life so this you know balance
[1609.32 - 1614.04] across different aspect of your
[1611.16 - 1617.24] lifestyle is I think what we have in our
[1614.04 - 1619.96] own hands and can
[1617.24 - 1622.36] do in addition to this I think there is
[1619.96 - 1625.68] screening right Manish absolutely I
[1622.36 - 1627.92] think screening and Screen Time make
[1625.68 - 1630.84] screening an annual ritual for for
[1627.92 - 1633.12] yourself and not just yourself the whole
[1630.84 - 1634.44] family I think because you know ill
[1633.12 - 1638.20] health affects the whole family that's
[1634.44 - 1640.36] fun and you know screen time you know
[1638.20 - 1642.56] please cut down on that and last but not
[1640.36 - 1644.28] least and it's an important Point what
[1642.56 - 1647.68] she alluded to was build meaningful
[1644.28 - 1649.68] relationships today I feel that taking a
[1647.68 - 1653.36] backseat of a lot of time you
[1649.68 - 1655.36] know the the diet the moving and the
[1653.36 - 1657.64] sleep I think a lot of people are doing
[1655.36 - 1659.80] that even in today's generation but this
[1657.64 - 1661.84] relationship at Community you sit on a
[1659.80 - 1664.20] bus you sit on a train you sit on a
[1661.84 - 1666.68] flight everyone's in their phone yeah
[1664.20 - 1668.72] we're no longer fostering even unknown
[1666.68 - 1671.08] conversations and when families go out
[1668.72 - 1674.24] to restaurants everyone's in their phone
[1671.08 - 1676.64] true yes so I think my takeaway point
[1674.24 - 1679.68] right now would be that but Dr Manish to
[1676.64 - 1682.68] take further on your screen screening at
[1679.68 - 1685.32] a polo preventive Healthcare I
[1682.68 - 1687.76] understand that you're using ouri to do
[1685.32 - 1689.96] a lot of the screening I like to send
[1687.76 - 1691.48] some of my celebrity clients there I
[1689.96 - 1693.60] like to send the young clients over
[1691.48 - 1696.48] there because they would be able to get
[1693.60 - 1699.44] these services so what is the gamut that
[1696.48 - 1703.00] somebody can expect and what are we
[1699.44 - 1704.44] screening and how early can we capture
[1703.00 - 1706.36] something like if you can give me an
[1704.44 - 1709.12] example like oh I know my grandfather
[1706.36 - 1710.52] had diabetes so or or something even
[1709.12 - 1712.76] more life-threatening as you said the
[1710.52 - 1717.48] incidences of cancer are going up oh I
[1712.76 - 1721.20] have XY Z cancer so can this AI
[1717.48 - 1723.68] screening really give us um more value
[1721.20 - 1726.00] for this real estate that I own so um
[1723.68 - 1729.08] you know recently launched our AI
[1726.00 - 1730.76] enabled Precision oncology centers um
[1729.08 - 1733.36] and we launched them I mean two of them
[1730.76 - 1735.84] in Bangalore and the biggest USP for
[1733.36 - 1739.12] those oncology centers is AI enable
[1735.84 - 1742.00] diagnosis so one is a fast diagnosis and
[1739.12 - 1744.64] a more accurate diagnosis because of the
[1742.00 - 1746.44] huge repository of data that we've built
[1744.64 - 1749.20] AP poo Cancer Centers have built over
[1746.44 - 1753.56] the last 40 odd years it has given us
[1749.20 - 1755.40] the capacity um to diagnose even rare
[1753.56 - 1757.40] cancers faster and you know more
[1755.40 - 1760.56] accurately so that's one even in the
[1757.40 - 1765.04] realm of cardiovascular diseases our AI
[1760.56 - 1768.20] enabled engine has uh the the predictive
[1765.04 - 1769.68] um you know um algorithm to diagnose
[1768.20 - 1771.68] cardiovascular disease is faster and
[1769.68 - 1773.52] better so these are the two immediate
[1771.68 - 1775.24] examples that come to my mind I think
[1773.52 - 1776.76] you know coincidently cardiovascular
[1775.24 - 1778.88] disease and cancer are the two most
[1776.76 - 1780.92] prevalent n cities in India and if a
[1778.88 - 1783.32] polo preventive Healthcare program can
[1780.92 - 1785.12] do something to mitigate that I think
[1783.32 - 1788.20] it'll be a great gift to the nation
[1785.12 - 1790.80] awesome so um the the cardiac risk score
[1788.20 - 1793.80] cardiac the the AI cardiovascular
[1790.80 - 1795.84] disease risk score um that we've built
[1793.80 - 1798.52] um actually has taken the
[1795.84 - 1801.88] longitudinal journeys of people people
[1798.52 - 1804.20] who've come to Apollo over many years
[1801.88 - 1806.08] can I say can I say that is like my
[1804.20 - 1808.80] report card from first standard to 10
[1806.08 - 1812.04] standard that's right that's right of
[1808.80 - 1814.28] all the PA all of of of a large cohort
[1812.04 - 1816.64] of people right but why would you want
[1814.28 - 1819.76] to know everybody yeah so a large cohort
[1816.64 - 1822.92] but why what is the purpose so basically
[1819.76 - 1826.96] we then know if somebody came in with
[1822.92 - 1830.76] certain types of indicators early what
[1826.96 - 1832.76] does that mean for that kind of person 5
[1830.76 - 1837.36] years out 10 years
[1832.76 - 1840.76] out and we've taken about 21 different
[1837.36 - 1843.80] contributors to the heart attack and
[1840.76 - 1847.44] figured out through an AI algorithm what
[1843.80 - 1849.60] is the combination that for this person
[1847.44 - 1851.28] right what is the paths that they are on
[1849.60 - 1853.52] right you said we throw the ball we know
[1851.28 - 1856.24] where it will land this is exactly what
[1853.52 - 1859.52] the cardiac rcore algorithm does today
[1856.24 - 1861.80] based on your current state which
[1859.52 - 1865.08] includes your family history
[1861.80 - 1866.20] unmodifiable risk factor and all your
[1865.08 - 1869.00] current
[1866.20 - 1871.88] lifestyle as well as your current health
[1869.00 - 1875.24] State we then are able to predict your
[1871.88 - 1878.56] chance of having a heart event within 10
[1875.24 - 1881.88] years within 10 years within 10
[1878.56 - 1884.20] years and if a 25-year-old walked in you
[1881.88 - 1886.60] could still tell them that you probably
[1884.20 - 1888.96] are a candidate for a heart attack by 35
[1886.60 - 1891.92] that's right so let me tell you the
[1888.96 - 1895.24] scarier statistic when we looked at 30
[1891.92 - 1897.20] to 50 year olds mhm who came in and then
[1895.24 - 1900.56] we applied the cardiac risk score on
[1897.20 - 1905.00] them after it was developed one in two
[1900.56 - 1907.76] of them right so 50% half of them have a
[1905.00 - 1909.76] moderate or high risk of having a
[1907.76 - 1910.92] cardiac event within the next 10 years
[1909.76 - 1912.92] so if I'm
[1910.92 - 1916.24] screening one is you're putting the fear
[1912.92 - 1918.68] of God in Me In terms of I one out of
[1916.24 - 1920.40] two that could have the heart attack
[1918.68 - 1921.88] and so now you're telling me that
[1920.40 - 1924.60] information and then you're asking me to
[1921.88 - 1926.24] change my sleep my diet my lifestyle and
[1924.60 - 1928.88] my community Ryan we need the wakeup
[1926.24 - 1931.16] call right I think we have all realized
[1928.88 - 1934.04] that without that we are going to coast
[1931.16 - 1936.60] in life anything anything what do you
[1934.04 - 1939.16] mean by Coast in life do the same things
[1936.60 - 1941.76] that we are used to without necessarily
[1939.16 - 1943.88] changing the path yeah preventive
[1941.76 - 1946.24] healthare is saying let me use the
[1943.88 - 1948.96] screening and figure out what's your
[1946.24 - 1952.44] pathway and if there's a roadblock ahead
[1948.96 - 1955.40] you could take a te tour te tour right
[1952.44 - 1958.00] so that you're able to ensure that yeah
[1955.40 - 1960.44] and good on a different path and i' just
[1958.00 - 1962.76] like to add one point here I think it's
[1960.44 - 1965.60] today the market is crowded with a lot
[1962.76 - 1967.64] of health check packages being offered
[1965.60 - 1969.36] by you know everybody yeah there are so
[1967.64 - 1971.88] many health so many packages so if I
[1969.36 - 1973.80] walk into Apollo Healthcare what what's
[1971.88 - 1976.48] what am I looking for or what am I what
[1973.80 - 1979.04] are the first things I need to do so one
[1976.48 - 1980.40] is of course as I said we simplified
[1979.04 - 1981.68] earlier you know we used to have a
[1980.40 - 1984.00] plethora of health package we've
[1981.68 - 1986.36] simplified now we have AIDS specific for
[1984.00 - 1988.68] men and women that's it so if you're a
[1986.36 - 1990.12] 30-year-old male you have a whole body
[1988.68 - 1991.60] test which has already been customized
[1990.12 - 1993.40] for you you don't need to kind of look
[1991.60 - 1995.92] through the whole Maze of tests so we've
[1993.40 - 1998.60] kind of simplified it and then with this
[1995.92 - 2001.00] AI enablement you can be assured of a
[1998.60 - 2003.04] faster and more accurate diagnosis third
[2001.00 - 2004.72] the point I was trying to make was that
[2003.04 - 2007.44] today everybody in the market is
[2004.72 - 2009.32] offering multiple Health packages it's
[2007.44 - 2012.76] very important to
[2009.32 - 2015.08] discern and be very careful in which
[2012.76 - 2016.64] hospital we go to you know I think it's
[2015.08 - 2018.12] important to trust very credible
[2016.64 - 2020.04] institution because it's your life that
[2018.12 - 2022.84] you're screening I mean that you're
[2020.04 - 2026.68] entrusting them with so rather than
[2022.84 - 2029.00] choosing the most economical or the most
[2026.68 - 2032.44] convenient health screening package it's
[2029.00 - 2034.60] important to do that with the most
[2032.44 - 2036.88] credible Health partner that you know so
[2034.60 - 2039.72] do some research you know you know you
[2036.88 - 2042.32] have these xyz's selling packages at
[2039.72 - 2044.80] 1,000 rupees and all I think we are we
[2042.32 - 2046.56] we shouldn't take that very very lightly
[2044.80 - 2048.84] it's better to kind of peer premium but
[2046.56 - 2051.04] get yourself screened at the best center
[2048.84 - 2054.44] uh with some research I think the
[2051.04 - 2057.36] additional way we've Incorporated AI
[2054.44 - 2061.48] into Pro Health which is Apollo's health
[2057.36 - 2064.92] check program is uh we are able to today
[2061.48 - 2066.52] personalize a package if you choose to
[2064.92 - 2070.12] based on your
[2066.52 - 2072.88] risks right so some people want a Tali
[2070.12 - 2076.52] right and we simplified the Tali to be
[2072.88 - 2080.00] able to easily pick and select others
[2076.52 - 2083.52] say no no I have gluten allergy lactose
[2080.00 - 2087.12] intolerance I actually want to go alak
[2083.52 - 2090.40] cart but how do I pick aart I'm not an
[2087.12 - 2092.44] expert as a lay person and what we've
[2090.40 - 2094.48] therefore done is sat with our doctors
[2092.44 - 2097.92] with years of their clinical expertise
[2094.48 - 2101.56] put together an engine that can predict
[2097.92 - 2104.44] based on simply 10 questions that you
[2101.56 - 2108.04] answer what you are at risk for and
[2104.44 - 2110.64] therefore what you should be tested for
[2108.04 - 2112.48] wow I'm already thinking how how do I
[2110.64 - 2116.04] get to the nearest Apollo H checkup and
[2112.48 - 2118.08] get it done okay so let's get more
[2116.04 - 2120.16] people tested in this country right
[2118.08 - 2122.68] that's going to be our mission and
[2120.16 - 2123.68] vision get more people screen get more
[2122.68 - 2127.68] people
[2123.68 - 2130.56] tested we are a very large country one
[2127.68 - 2133.52] .3 billion plus people I'm sure there's
[2130.56 - 2136.40] a lot of statistical variation North
[2133.52 - 2140.12] India South India there's this huge
[2136.40 - 2141.84] dietary difference uh height difference
[2140.12 - 2145.32] body type difference pollution
[2141.84 - 2148.48] difference um are there any data coming
[2145.32 - 2150.52] up to you guys that says that people
[2148.48 - 2152.04] from South India should uh run faster
[2150.52 - 2153.68] for a testing people from North India
[2152.04 - 2156.60] should run faster with give us some
[2153.68 - 2158.80] insights so there was a recent report um
[2156.60 - 2162.48] I read uh which was conducted across
[2158.80 - 2165.12] several States in in India uh you know
[2162.48 - 2167.60] if I look at diabetes for
[2165.12 - 2170.16] example South and North are actually
[2167.60 - 2172.04] equally predisposed although Central and
[2170.16 - 2174.24] Northeastern parts of the country have
[2172.04 - 2176.12] less incidents of diabetes it's also an
[2174.24 - 2178.16] urban phenomena so right Urban
[2176.12 - 2181.04] population has more diabetes incidents
[2178.16 - 2183.92] than rural population but interestingly
[2181.04 - 2185.40] pre-diabetes is actually the the number
[2183.92 - 2187.00] is much higher than the diabetic
[2185.40 - 2190.40] population which is a very dangerous
[2187.00 - 2193.32] thing Dr for the uninitiated there right
[2190.40 - 2196.44] everyone says diabetes diabetes diabetes
[2193.32 - 2198.72] can you in a layman term explain what is
[2196.44 - 2202.00] diabetes and then what is pre-diabetes
[2198.72 - 2206.28] yeah so diabetes is a condition where
[2202.00 - 2209.16] the body's ability to produce insulin is
[2206.28 - 2211.64] compromised insulin is produced from uh
[2209.16 - 2213.64] pancreas and when there are cells in
[2211.64 - 2216.80] pancreas that become nonfunctional the
[2213.64 - 2219.32] insulin quantity reduces and our body's
[2216.80 - 2221.80] ability to process glucose diminishes
[2219.32 - 2223.92] and hence you have high blood sugar and
[2221.80 - 2226.28] whence that blood sugar touches a
[2223.92 - 2228.00] certain threshold or remains beyond the
[2226.28 - 2231.00] threshold consistently that's when we
[2228.00 - 2233.24] call you know at a diabetic condition so
[2231.00 - 2235.12] and then the pre-diabetic pre-diabetes a
[2233.24 - 2236.48] stage which is oh I'm going to get I'm
[2235.12 - 2238.00] going to get diabetes so the AI is
[2236.48 - 2240.24] saying you're going to go down that path
[2238.00 - 2241.64] right we have a pre-diabetes risk score
[2240.24 - 2243.56] because once you have diabetes there's
[2241.64 - 2245.68] no point in any AI predicting anything
[2243.56 - 2248.84] in the future have it you have it but
[2245.68 - 2251.08] the pre-diabetes risk core tells you
[2248.84 - 2253.40] based again on your family history your
[2251.08 - 2255.84] predisposition as well as your lifestyle
[2253.40 - 2258.32] choices what is your risk of getting
[2255.84 - 2259.76] pre-diabetes which is your glycosilated
[2258.32 - 2265.12] hemoglobin or
[2259.76 - 2267.08] hb1c between 5.8 and 6.4 so everyone if
[2265.12 - 2269.28] you're out here in South India let's all
[2267.08 - 2271.32] get tested pre-diabetic because we're
[2269.28 - 2273.20] eating too much of carbohydrates or rice
[2271.32 - 2275.24] and our sugar levels have gone up but
[2273.20 - 2277.52] what about North India I think South
[2275.24 - 2279.84] India overall has a slightly marginally
[2277.52 - 2281.96] high risk for ncds overall but I think
[2279.84 - 2284.20] diabetes and hypertension are I would
[2281.96 - 2285.24] say uniformly equally distributed only
[2284.20 - 2286.96] the central part of India and
[2285.24 - 2289.08] northeastern part of India where had
[2286.96 - 2291.96] less incidents of these two conditions
[2289.08 - 2293.68] among genders men have a higher
[2291.96 - 2296.36] predisposition for you know high
[2293.68 - 2298.32] cholesterol level than women uh so that
[2296.36 - 2301.08] was the other finding but in all of this
[2298.32 - 2303.52] I would say the biggest alarming finding
[2301.08 - 2306.16] has been the rising incidence of
[2303.52 - 2309.24] pre-diabetes across urban and rural
[2306.16 - 2311.40] areas so that you know I think today for
[2309.24 - 2312.80] example we have 98 million diabetics in
[2311.40 - 2315.00] the country we the diabetic Capital
[2312.80 - 2317.36] right which di 17% of all overall
[2315.00 - 2319.48] diabetics globally and I think we love
[2317.36 - 2320.68] our food and we love our sweets and also
[2319.48 - 2323.32] that the fact that we have this
[2320.68 - 2325.64] propensity exactly propensity as a
[2323.32 - 2327.44] population you made something very keen
[2325.64 - 2329.92] because my father-in-law is an
[2327.44 - 2332.36] orthopedic surgeon he's 78 years old and
[2329.92 - 2335.32] he loves he's from orisa and he loves
[2332.36 - 2338.36] his mishy doy and rusas and all and he
[2335.32 - 2341.88] eats more sugar than I do right and he
[2338.36 - 2343.56] has an hp1c score of 5.2 so you
[2341.88 - 2346.16] mentioned something from that part of
[2343.56 - 2348.00] India people have a diabetic resistant G
[2346.16 - 2350.68] gene or something I mean they have less
[2348.00 - 2352.04] propensity less propensity for diabetes
[2350.68 - 2353.60] I'm just thinking and I'm sure he's
[2352.04 - 2355.96] quite active isn't he yeah he's very
[2353.60 - 2358.72] active I'm just thinking if we could
[2355.96 - 2361.84] just get that Gene you know and uh like
[2358.72 - 2366.24] eat our rcas more often but jokes jokes
[2361.84 - 2368.76] apart I think as a nutritionist people
[2366.24 - 2370.84] are eating far more than their fathers
[2368.76 - 2373.28] and mothers and their grandfathers and
[2370.84 - 2374.84] grandmothers we just did a food diary
[2373.28 - 2376.76] with few of our clients I I had the
[2374.84 - 2379.28] privilege of working with a family of
[2376.76 - 2381.04] three generations so I would ask the
[2379.28 - 2383.48] grandfather and grandmother how many
[2381.04 - 2386.48] times you ate out so they met out once a
[2383.48 - 2387.56] quarter at MTR and ate once a quarter
[2386.48 - 2389.96] because they didn't have that much of
[2387.56 - 2393.00] money right the father and mother met
[2389.96 - 2396.68] out once a month you didn't have that
[2393.00 - 2398.44] much money true the children are in MTR
[2396.68 - 2401.96] every third day
[2398.44 - 2403.96] right so so the incidences of external
[2401.96 - 2405.88] exposure and therefore when you go out
[2403.96 - 2408.88] no portion control you eat how much you
[2405.88 - 2410.56] want absolutely and with the new thing
[2408.88 - 2413.00] which I feel is that people are just
[2410.56 - 2416.00] eating more because they're stressed out
[2413.00 - 2419.36] like we work very hard and that's what
[2416.00 - 2422.04] that Grandfather said we did a 9 to5 job
[2419.36 - 2423.68] there was no SMS WhatsApp or or Zoom
[2422.04 - 2426.28] call at 7:00 in the evening which your
[2423.68 - 2428.04] boss gone to you so you stopped your day
[2426.28 - 2430.32] but your generation
[2428.04 - 2431.68] are working double hard which means the
[2430.32 - 2434.40] brain is working so much so when you
[2431.68 - 2437.40] finish your day you're like I don't need
[2434.40 - 2439.40] a reward yeah yeah yeah or you're not as
[2437.40 - 2441.12] conscious about it also because you're
[2439.40 - 2443.64] so distracted with so many things that
[2441.12 - 2445.48] are going on I never thought about that
[2443.64 - 2447.76] right being distracted yeah and
[2445.48 - 2451.36] therefore you end up just uh consuming
[2447.76 - 2454.60] whatever how much ever without really
[2451.36 - 2457.32] being mindful about what's going on and
[2454.60 - 2459.40] since a lot of your followers like new
[2457.32 - 2462.52] nutrition allow me to actually talk
[2459.40 - 2465.88] about my three rules around consumption
[2462.52 - 2468.52] the first is reduce reduce right um
[2465.88 - 2470.76] let's stop eating when we are 80% full
[2468.52 - 2473.80] Ah that's a nice thought yeah and so
[2470.76 - 2476.52] reduce the second is
[2473.80 - 2477.92] reorder proteins and vegetables and
[2476.52 - 2480.36] fruits
[2477.92 - 2482.80] first and then carbohydrates Oh I
[2480.36 - 2485.52] thought you meant reorder a aater get me
[2482.80 - 2488.80] another order I was like this doctor is
[2485.52 - 2490.36] really cool okay re means change the
[2488.80 - 2491.84] order in which you are consuming
[2490.36 - 2493.80] consuming yeah that's right so say that
[2491.84 - 2495.16] again protein first and veget protein
[2493.80 - 2497.76] and fruits and vegetables vegetables
[2495.16 - 2499.64] first first then carbohydrates so for
[2497.76 - 2501.76] example in our home the proteins come
[2499.64 - 2503.92] out to the table first get served first
[2501.76 - 2506.64] salads fruits and vegetables even if in
[2503.92 - 2508.76] a cooked form get served first so while
[2506.64 - 2510.44] it's first on your table even if you're
[2508.76 - 2512.80] mindless about it you're that's what
[2510.44 - 2515.64] you're consuming first and you get a
[2512.80 - 2518.24] little bit full and then come the carbs
[2515.64 - 2521.60] onto your plate right and so
[2518.24 - 2524.08] reorder and the third is replace where
[2521.60 - 2526.48] you can find a way to replace the
[2524.08 - 2528.48] processed foods that we are used to
[2526.48 - 2531.04] these days with a little bit more
[2528.48 - 2534.28] traditional foods like some of your
[2531.04 - 2536.88] millets or uh brown rice brown sugar
[2534.28 - 2539.92] jagi and so forth in reduced quantities
[2536.88 - 2543.04] right so allows us to then replace some
[2539.92 - 2545.44] of the ingredients in what we cook for
[2543.04 - 2548.96] an overall balanced meal but it's still
[2545.44 - 2550.48] the kind of food that we eat every day
[2548.96 - 2552.64] at home without putting pressure on the
[2550.48 - 2553.96] kitchen yeah so I just wanted to add I
[2552.64 - 2555.88] mean you know and you would probably I
[2553.96 - 2558.00] mean you're the expert this that Dean
[2555.88 - 2560.64] Nash's diet what have I got the name did
[2558.00 - 2562.52] I get the name Dean orish diet right
[2560.64 - 2565.08] that actually changing your dietary
[2562.52 - 2567.04] habits can reverse aging and reverse
[2565.08 - 2569.20] many of these conditions isn't that
[2567.04 - 2571.44] right so as as a celebrity nutritionist
[2569.20 - 2575.12] I make a lot of money doing that exactly
[2571.44 - 2577.32] exactly the job so I meant it's just not
[2575.12 - 2579.08] the I mean screening is big part of it
[2577.32 - 2580.56] but I think diet and change in
[2579.08 - 2582.12] modification right I think going forward
[2580.56 - 2584.04] is going to be play a big role if doctor
[2582.12 - 2586.96] I can speak very candidly from a
[2584.04 - 2589.80] nutritionist to a doctor the screening
[2586.96 - 2591.96] gives you the Wake Up Call yes to wake
[2589.80 - 2595.32] up and smell the roses that you have
[2591.96 - 2597.16] only one body absolutely and this body
[2595.32 - 2600.04] cannot be replaced like your mobile
[2597.16 - 2601.48] phone laptop house and even spouse in
[2600.04 - 2603.80] fact one day I had an argument with my
[2601.48 - 2605.24] wife I said my body is my life partner
[2603.80 - 2607.80] she says what do you mean to say I'm
[2605.24 - 2609.52] your life partner I'm like look dude I
[2607.80 - 2612.52] had to get out of bed to get married to
[2609.52 - 2614.40] you the body went it got married to you
[2612.52 - 2617.08] trust me very true our body should be a
[2614.40 - 2619.96] first love yes and so I told her this my
[2617.08 - 2621.76] wife is not hearing this yeah no you
[2619.96 - 2624.32] like me like me I slept in the next
[2621.76 - 2626.28] bedroom for the next one week yeah you
[2624.32 - 2629.68] sleep with your life part but but at the
[2626.28 - 2632.24] end of the day um you know when we do
[2629.68 - 2635.96] these screenings I have
[2632.24 - 2638.68] seen an instant disciplinary
[2635.96 - 2640.72] modification by my client the reason
[2638.68 - 2644.12] being is I'll give you an example oh
[2640.72 - 2645.88] Dean Onish told me to eat this diet plan
[2644.12 - 2650.52] Ryan Fernando told me to eat this di
[2645.88 - 2652.84] plan but if your AI heart screening says
[2650.52 - 2655.20] you are predisposition to diabetes or
[2652.84 - 2656.84] heart attack in so many days then the
[2655.20 - 2659.60] person's sitting down in the counseling
[2656.84 - 2662.00] room and saying what do I need to change
[2659.60 - 2664.12] yes it's the trigger for change
[2662.00 - 2665.88] behavioral modification for change and I
[2664.12 - 2667.76] think over a period of time if genetic
[2665.88 - 2669.96] screening were to become cheap and
[2667.76 - 2671.52] mandatory in some form or shape that
[2669.96 - 2673.68] would actually lead to you know
[2671.52 - 2676.12] Revolution so to speak and also these
[2673.68 - 2679.48] exercise variables that we using uh
[2676.12 - 2680.84] gives another data set point and um I
[2679.48 - 2682.36] think people are shying away from the
[2680.84 - 2685.80] fact that they can take control of their
[2682.36 - 2688.72] life yeah but speaking of control uh we
[2685.80 - 2691.20] all work right and we all work and we
[2688.72 - 2693.16] have this 9 to5 we have to report in
[2691.20 - 2695.12] you're here today on my podcast only 9
[2693.16 - 2697.88] to5 Ryan what kind of job do you do oh I
[2695.12 - 2699.76] have a 9 to5 job I doing do my diet my
[2697.88 - 2702.52] sleep and my workouts
[2699.76 - 2706.12] correctly but the fact of the matter is
[2702.52 - 2708.48] here's this okay I believe corporates
[2706.12 - 2711.72] can do lot more for their
[2708.48 - 2715.32] employees how do you think a polo
[2711.72 - 2719.64] preventive healthare can be embedded and
[2715.32 - 2723.28] do you feel doctor that it has a
[2719.64 - 2727.08] productivity impact on an
[2723.28 - 2729.44] employee so um let me start with first
[2727.08 - 2730.96] Apollo's own example yeah right our
[2729.44 - 2734.36] chair what do you mean by Apollo's own
[2730.96 - 2735.88] example so our chairman Pratap Redi uh
[2734.36 - 2737.56] is exceptionally passionate about
[2735.88 - 2741.04] preventive Health he in fact started the
[2737.56 - 2744.56] master health screening in 1974 in India
[2741.04 - 2747.40] I was not even born then wow that that
[2744.56 - 2748.68] early on he's the pioneer of pioneer of
[2747.40 - 2749.60] preventive Health PR health checks in
[2748.68 - 2752.16] the
[2749.60 - 2755.92] country okay and he's constantly pushing
[2752.16 - 2759.12] us to evolve um about 5 six years ago he
[2755.92 - 2762.16] said listen as corporates we actually
[2759.12 - 2764.72] our biggest asset are our employees and
[2762.16 - 2767.52] we Apollo are in the healthcare sector
[2764.72 - 2769.92] we need to lead the way uh for all
[2767.52 - 2774.32] corporates so all of the employees at
[2769.92 - 2776.76] apulu will get their uh Pro Health done
[2774.32 - 2779.60] um at the expense of the
[2776.76 - 2781.44] company one year goes by two year goes
[2779.60 - 2783.36] by a few people here in there who have
[2781.44 - 2784.16] triggers in their personal life went and
[2783.36 - 2787.88] did
[2784.16 - 2790.64] it um but not everybody we many many
[2787.88 - 2791.68] people avoided it like the general
[2790.64 - 2795.92] public
[2791.68 - 2798.92] today and then one year he said we will
[2795.92 - 2802.36] not be doing performance
[2798.92 - 2806.36] appraisals if you do not complete your
[2802.36 - 2808.88] hell check by March 31 and that applied
[2806.36 - 2810.28] to doctors as well doctors as well
[2808.88 - 2812.24] you're kidding me doctors were not doing
[2810.28 - 2817.16] the preventive Health not all of them
[2812.24 - 2820.28] and he made it for them as well and the
[2817.16 - 2821.84] was Madness right Madness because
[2820.28 - 2824.24] sometimes you need a parent to take care
[2821.84 - 2826.68] of you yes but here's the beauty of it
[2824.24 - 2828.68] after that that year you didn't have to
[2826.68 - 2829.88] repeat that statement ever again it
[2828.68 - 2832.96] became a
[2829.88 - 2835.32] habit every year now we just get people
[2832.96 - 2837.52] coming because we then give a reminder
[2835.32 - 2839.96] and then they said ah and then the I
[2837.52 - 2842.36] guess the trauma of that year um they
[2839.96 - 2846.36] come and they do it I think more and
[2842.36 - 2848.80] more and more corporates need to um uh
[2846.36 - 2851.44] take this on right and do this for their
[2848.80 - 2854.64] employees but now that we have at a
[2851.44 - 2857.56] large cohort level multiple years of
[2854.64 - 2860.12] having done this Ryan what we're seeing
[2857.56 - 2861.40] in terms of the reduction in the
[2860.12 - 2865.24] unmanaged
[2861.40 - 2869.44] diabetes unmanaged cholesterol levels
[2865.24 - 2872.32] and most important the decline in
[2869.44 - 2874.68] obesity right it's it's staggering so we
[2872.32 - 2876.56] now have the data to be able to see at
[2874.68 - 2878.56] an aggregate level of a is hypertension
[2876.56 - 2879.56] also part of this because I'm assuming
[2878.56 - 2881.88] there's a lot of stress and it's also
[2879.56 - 2883.68] coming down there a lot of stress that's
[2881.88 - 2885.60] also coming down because see once you're
[2883.68 - 2887.24] diagnosed with it you manage it but if
[2885.60 - 2889.16] you know you have a propensity and you
[2887.24 - 2890.60] learn to manage it and ultimately it
[2889.16 - 2893.08] comes down to what you consume how much
[2890.60 - 2894.84] you move how you sleep and how you
[2893.08 - 2896.32] manage your stress right and so we'll
[2894.84 - 2897.80] talk a little bit about Pro Health and
[2896.32 - 2899.92] how we are incorporating some of the
[2897.80 - 2902.16] follow-ups and nudges to be able to do
[2899.92 - 2907.72] that but staying with your your founder
[2902.16 - 2909.76] Dr ready and uh doing this in 1974
[2907.72 - 2912.92] I get called in to do a lot of events
[2909.76 - 2916.20] and speak about it when the
[2912.92 - 2917.68] leader leads the organization from the
[2916.20 - 2920.20] value of the
[2917.68 - 2922.84] employee and the value is not only from
[2920.20 - 2925.16] a perspective of productivity but the
[2922.84 - 2927.96] essence of a person then Healthcare
[2925.16 - 2929.80] becomes crucially and truly important
[2927.96 - 2931.80] yes where am I going with the statement
[2929.80 - 2935.72] I had a billionaire client who
[2931.80 - 2938.04] instructed his HR to set up Healthcare
[2935.72 - 2940.16] preventive in the
[2938.04 - 2943.00] organization but many times and this
[2940.16 - 2946.96] goes out to the rest of India many times
[2943.00 - 2950.16] HR is truly focused on the bottom line
[2946.96 - 2953.80] truly focused on only holidays and truly
[2950.16 - 2958.04] only focused on attendance marking and
[2953.80 - 2961.84] how we can get more out of people and if
[2958.04 - 2964.76] Apollo as an organization in itself led
[2961.84 - 2966.80] by a doctor who's a leader insists that
[2964.76 - 2969.08] everyone gets their health checkup done
[2966.80 - 2971.64] and puts a dictat to it and I think the
[2969.08 - 2975.24] word over there is dictat because I
[2971.64 - 2977.04] remember once sitting as a nutritionist
[2975.24 - 2980.24] I asked myself when I run my own
[2977.04 - 2982.16] organization today as this as the head
[2980.24 - 2985.88] of my organization as a
[2982.16 - 2988.88] Founder do I invade my employees
[2985.88 - 2992.28] privacy or am I actually being the
[2988.88 - 2994.88] crystal ball astrologer and saying I
[2992.28 - 2997.32] want to take care of you so I send a
[2994.88 - 2999.08] message back to your founder
[2997.32 - 3000.56] kudos to what he's done for all the
[2999.08 - 3003.56] people at Polo and I think every
[3000.56 - 3007.40] organization out there needs to have a
[3003.56 - 3009.48] leader that puts a boot silently up
[3007.40 - 3012.40] everyone saying that you need to get
[3009.48 - 3015.08] your Health Care Checkup done so
[3012.40 - 3016.72] speaking of offices can we do these Pro
[3015.08 - 3020.84] Health checkups in
[3016.72 - 3023.32] offices absolutely I think um in in our
[3020.84 - 3026.04] conversations with uh corporates and
[3023.32 - 3029.36] companies what we realize is uh even if
[3026.04 - 3032.36] they have a set of offerings right and
[3029.36 - 3034.56] pral checks for their employees very few
[3032.36 - 3038.68] actually take it up anywhere from 10 to
[3034.56 - 3041.80] 30% of employees actually uh go to a
[3038.68 - 3043.48] center and uh Avail a pro health and
[3041.80 - 3045.48] therefore we realize we have to rethink
[3043.48 - 3049.32] the model because uh employees don't
[3045.48 - 3051.28] want to uh do this um at a at a take the
[3049.32 - 3053.96] time to to go out it's actually quite
[3051.28 - 3055.84] inconvenient especially in cities where
[3053.96 - 3057.68] some of the centers are very far away
[3055.84 - 3058.96] from their homes so we've actually
[3057.68 - 3061.76] innovated on a couple of different
[3058.96 - 3064.60] models um one is we have what is called
[3061.76 - 3069.16] an Apollo health check on Wheels this is
[3064.60 - 3072.12] a mobile bus that is fitted with
[3069.16 - 3075.00] equipment such as a digital x-ray or a
[3072.12 - 3077.12] mamogram and has additional equipment
[3075.00 - 3079.12] that can be wheeled off so a cardiac
[3077.12 - 3082.12] stress bike to make sure that we can
[3079.12 - 3084.68] test your heart under some endurance um
[3082.12 - 3086.28] eye screening audiometry and so forth
[3084.68 - 3087.12] along with of course your routine blood
[3086.28 - 3088.76] test
[3087.12 - 3090.40] but we wanted to make sure that what we
[3088.76 - 3092.52] offer to employees is actually quite
[3090.40 - 3096.04] comprehensive and not just simply blood
[3092.52 - 3098.08] tests and so we have the fitted um ahc
[3096.04 - 3100.24] on wheels or Apollo H checks on wheels
[3098.08 - 3103.76] that can then go park itself in an
[3100.24 - 3105.84] office complex and then be able to um
[3103.76 - 3108.28] conduct the screenings at the
[3105.84 - 3111.28] convenience of the employees um over a
[3108.28 - 3112.80] period of a few days another uh
[3111.28 - 3115.36] Innovation that we've actually worked
[3112.80 - 3116.92] out operationally is your hchi can be
[3115.36 - 3119.24] broken up into a couple of different
[3116.92 - 3121.88] parts the first part is we draw your
[3119.24 - 3123.08] blood let's say a flomist or a nurse can
[3121.88 - 3127.72] come out to the
[3123.08 - 3129.44] office at your desk or in a common room
[3127.72 - 3130.92] you come in and they draw your blood
[3129.44 - 3133.24] label your samples and ship it off to
[3130.92 - 3135.72] the lab they are then able to process
[3133.24 - 3138.08] the reports and keep it ready you then
[3135.72 - 3140.56] can book an appointment for the Imaging
[3138.08 - 3144.32] component your ultrasound your mamogram
[3140.56 - 3146.64] your uh x-ray um ECG Echo and so forth
[3144.32 - 3149.84] to make sure it's a comprehensive has
[3146.64 - 3151.92] check in the hospital or the clinic at a
[3149.84 - 3153.48] time that's convenient to you and
[3151.92 - 3155.36] because the blood is already drawn the
[3153.48 - 3157.80] reports are ready the doctor review can
[3155.36 - 3159.24] happen right away and this can also be
[3157.80 - 3160.56] done at any time of the day it could be
[3159.24 - 3162.64] during your lunch break it could be in
[3160.56 - 3164.48] the evening it could be on a Sunday and
[3162.64 - 3167.80] you also spend less time because you're
[3164.48 - 3169.88] not waiting for the lab reports to get
[3167.80 - 3172.24] to come in so this is another way that
[3169.88 - 3174.92] we've actually uh innovated to be able
[3172.24 - 3177.40] to make this more convenient for
[3174.92 - 3180.32] employees and you know the last year Al
[3177.40 - 3183.24] we probably have screened about 8 to
[3180.32 - 3185.96] 9,000 um corporate Health uh corporate
[3183.24 - 3188.96] employees uh in their campuses through
[3185.96 - 3191.24] this um and we besides this we also give
[3188.96 - 3193.44] them corporate Health report cards
[3191.24 - 3196.24] report cards health I that's important
[3193.44 - 3198.48] right when when I get a report card then
[3196.24 - 3200.64] I I know that I have to do some steps
[3198.48 - 3202.48] it's not like washed under the rug that
[3200.64 - 3205.24] I just got a absolutely so there's a
[3202.48 - 3207.44] report card at the individual level um
[3205.24 - 3210.48] that tells you what's going on what
[3207.44 - 3213.04] needs immediate attention and then what
[3210.48 - 3215.96] are some of the next steps for you to
[3213.04 - 3219.08] actually do and then there is a company
[3215.96 - 3221.80] report card as well right because if you
[3219.08 - 3223.88] think about the company as a community
[3221.80 - 3226.68] and productivity and the health of the
[3223.88 - 3229.20] employees is an important asset for you
[3226.68 - 3233.48] then at an aggregate level how are you
[3229.20 - 3237.20] doing right if your um employees have
[3233.48 - 3239.20] much higher numbers have hyperen
[3237.20 - 3240.28] than the average in in the population
[3239.20 - 3242.48] then there's something for you to
[3240.28 - 3244.64] actually think about yeah that's very
[3242.48 - 3246.52] interesting because there's a joke over
[3244.64 - 3249.80] here when we were sitting at one of the
[3246.52 - 3254.04] Fortune 500 companies as a nutrition
[3249.80 - 3255.84] clinic so we did a small survey and we
[3254.04 - 3258.12] asked the employees to tick mark and one
[3255.84 - 3259.72] of the questions was about constipation
[3258.12 - 3263.72] so about 100 employees went through the
[3259.72 - 3266.24] survey and about 67 of them or 68 of
[3263.72 - 3270.16] them ticked Mark constipation and so
[3266.24 - 3271.80] when the head HR saw that she went no
[3270.16 - 3274.68] wonder everyone walks through the front
[3271.80 - 3277.12] door with a with a grumpy face early
[3274.68 - 3279.96] morning that's exactly right so what
[3277.12 - 3282.60] you're saying to me is the health of an
[3279.96 - 3284.56] organization is truly reflected in the
[3282.60 - 3287.12] health of its people and that's when I
[3284.56 - 3290.04] realized this so getting a report card
[3287.12 - 3292.40] not only for the individual but the
[3290.04 - 3294.00] organization yes I think every CFO
[3292.40 - 3296.00] should be listening and carefully about
[3294.00 - 3298.32] this and then the head of HR who saw
[3296.00 - 3300.64] this and then choose to do something
[3298.32 - 3303.24] more meaningful around constipation
[3300.64 - 3304.60] related activities right whether it's
[3303.24 - 3307.16] changing what they serve in the kitchen
[3304.60 - 3308.64] to have more fiber or talking much more
[3307.16 - 3310.36] about different aspects of fiber
[3308.64 - 3312.96] changing the snacks in the kitchen for
[3310.36 - 3315.28] more fiber and allows them to focus some
[3312.96 - 3317.48] of the well-being programs around things
[3315.28 - 3319.36] that actually matter rather than just
[3317.48 - 3321.48] the generic well-being program so we
[3319.36 - 3324.04] talked about the adults and the office
[3321.48 - 3326.36] space and I'm sure there are a lot of
[3324.04 - 3328.84] mothers out there who are also working
[3326.36 - 3331.40] and the first question that any mother
[3328.84 - 3333.28] asks is about her children yes so are
[3331.40 - 3336.16] there any
[3333.28 - 3338.20] actionable sets of things that people
[3336.16 - 3340.56] can do what can a doctor give an advice
[3338.20 - 3342.68] for children out there for
[3340.56 - 3344.84] this I don't know if I can call it a
[3342.68 - 3346.48] pandemic of oncoming diabetes
[3344.84 - 3348.48] hypertension and non-communicable
[3346.48 - 3351.28] diseases so what should parents do with
[3348.48 - 3353.60] their children or what what should we do
[3351.28 - 3355.80] so at Apollo what we found Ryan is that
[3353.60 - 3358.00] um three out of five children today
[3355.80 - 3362.84] especially in urban and privileged
[3358.00 - 3366.80] schools are obese three out of five
[3362.84 - 3370.96] overweight or obese wow yeah and that
[3366.80 - 3374.80] essentially is setting the stage for a
[3370.96 - 3376.88] very young adulthood that could have
[3374.80 - 3379.28] many of these ncds much much earlier
[3376.88 - 3382.52] much earlier so we going to be the
[3379.28 - 3385.04] youngest 1.3 billion population but also
[3382.52 - 3386.60] have the highest amount of uh these
[3385.04 - 3388.88] lifestyle diseases unless we do
[3386.60 - 3390.36] something about it now and screening is
[3388.88 - 3392.28] one of them and changing the behavior of
[3390.36 - 3394.28] the younger kids sorry so what what is
[3392.28 - 3396.28] the next part of this three out of five
[3394.28 - 3398.84] we actually did uh with Pro Health at
[3396.28 - 3401.52] Apollo is to actually think about from a
[3398.84 - 3404.72] pediatric perspective right what do you
[3401.52 - 3407.20] need to know about a child at five or 6
[3404.72 - 3409.92] years old when they're ready to go to
[3407.20 - 3412.72] school is their eyesight okay do they
[3409.92 - 3414.60] have any sort of attention related
[3412.72 - 3418.16] conditions right that you need to be
[3414.60 - 3420.28] watching out for uh adolescence hormones
[3418.16 - 3422.72] kick in very different kinds of
[3420.28 - 3424.40] behaviors what are we doing to actually
[3422.72 - 3427.32] make sure we're screening for some of
[3424.40 - 3429.32] those issues right girl hits puberty do
[3427.32 - 3430.88] we have enough iron in the diet right
[3429.32 - 3433.28] what are some of the hormones doing to
[3430.88 - 3435.48] their body what are some of the um
[3433.28 - 3437.40] high-risk behaviors that teenagers are
[3435.48 - 3440.40] getting into so we've actually thought
[3437.40 - 3443.44] about different stages of childhood if
[3440.40 - 3446.96] you will um and then said what should we
[3443.44 - 3449.64] be screening for based on what the
[3446.96 - 3451.96] pediatrician is picking up so the first
[3449.64 - 3454.16] thing is make sure you do go see the
[3451.96 - 3456.64] pediatrician early ages will be all
[3454.16 - 3458.84] about vaccinations but then around 5 six
[3456.64 - 3461.12] then let's add uh a little bit around
[3458.84 - 3464.12] what uh they need to be ready for school
[3461.12 - 3465.68] um subsequent years after 5 till 10 you
[3464.12 - 3468.88] actually lose touch with the
[3465.68 - 3470.88] pediatrician true yeah and 10 you come
[3468.88 - 3472.96] back for couple of vaccinations and
[3470.88 - 3475.56] you're on the cusp of puberty so the
[3472.96 - 3478.32] pediatrician has another opportunity and
[3475.56 - 3481.12] then what after that tell me when you go
[3478.32 - 3484.24] to a doctor next only when you have a
[3481.12 - 3486.88] symptom or you're sick right but I think
[3484.24 - 3489.12] having uh some touch and engagement with
[3486.88 - 3491.92] your pediatrician at least until you're
[3489.12 - 3494.88] 16 allows them a
[3491.92 - 3496.56] window into figuring out if there's
[3494.88 - 3500.44] anything going on and it could be
[3496.56 - 3504.72] something as simple as um when suddenly
[3500.44 - 3508.04] uh boys grow taller at a particular age
[3504.72 - 3510.64] their body's phys iology right uh is not
[3508.04 - 3512.24] keeping up yet with the shooting up in
[3510.64 - 3513.32] the height and therefore they may have
[3512.24 - 3515.40] some
[3513.32 - 3516.64] dizziness and so it's little things like
[3515.40 - 3518.48] that that parents don't have to stress
[3516.64 - 3519.76] about but if they know in advance and
[3518.48 - 3522.64] the best person to get someone that
[3519.76 - 3524.80] advice from is actually an expert doctor
[3522.64 - 3526.36] a pediatrician in this case so as
[3524.80 - 3528.64] parents if you can't get through to your
[3526.36 - 3530.28] children directly find a way to engage
[3528.64 - 3533.36] with through your pediatrician on a
[3530.28 - 3536.64] regular basis and you know to just drive
[3533.36 - 3539.20] home that point we have a whole vertical
[3536.64 - 3541.20] dedicated for uh kids called Apollo
[3539.20 - 3542.72] childrens I mean it's whole vertical and
[3541.20 - 3545.12] not just looking after acute care or
[3542.72 - 3547.08] chronic care but also Wellness um as
[3545.12 - 3549.84] part of this verticle just to kind of
[3547.08 - 3551.80] focus more on this this age group uh
[3549.84 - 3554.24] which needs attention in multiple forms
[3551.80 - 3557.48] I think most of us as parents we kind of
[3554.24 - 3559.32] like hear a Hospital's name and think uh
[3557.48 - 3562.92] oh if I take my kid over there the kid
[3559.32 - 3565.80] is sick uh it's a place of pain but
[3562.92 - 3568.60] actually we need to rethink preventive
[3565.80 - 3570.68] health care yeah even for our children
[3568.60 - 3573.28] because I am at the nutrition clinic
[3570.68 - 3575.68] doing a lot of sports kids and in these
[3573.28 - 3577.16] sports kids we ask for a blood test
[3575.68 - 3579.56] because I am going to give them a
[3577.16 - 3581.44] protein powder a sports drink a
[3579.56 - 3582.92] multivitamin and I'm like look I don't
[3581.44 - 3585.00] want to give you a product I know you
[3582.92 - 3587.84] play four hours of tennis a day 6 hours
[3585.00 - 3589.60] of tennis a day or 6 hours of golf a day
[3587.84 - 3590.76] but I know that I can't give you the
[3589.60 - 3592.72] stuff unless I know there is a
[3590.76 - 3594.68] nutritional deficency let's do a blood
[3592.72 - 3598.56] test and lo and behold when we do a
[3594.68 - 3601.44] blood test on a n 10 12 15y old 16y old
[3598.56 - 3605.92] we have high cholesterol we have uric
[3601.44 - 3608.36] acid right and that's scary yeah I think
[3605.92 - 3610.68] some somewhere parents also have to
[3608.36 - 3612.56] share some part of that blame because
[3610.68 - 3614.20] you made that point early on also we are
[3612.56 - 3616.88] consuming more than we need and that's
[3614.20 - 3618.68] true for kids I mean obesity is on a
[3616.88 - 3620.32] rise and I'm not surprised with these
[3618.68 - 3622.64] cholesterol levels and sugar levels on
[3620.32 - 3624.24] the rise as well you know screen time
[3622.64 - 3626.80] look at screen time look at the kind of
[3624.24 - 3629.48] processed food they're consuming
[3626.80 - 3631.36] I think it's extremely unusual and I'll
[3629.48 - 3633.32] not be surprised and that kind of ties
[3631.36 - 3636.04] into a point about pre-diabetics On The
[3633.32 - 3637.56] Rise so it's all a chain and somewhere I
[3636.04 - 3639.96] think parents also have to share that
[3637.56 - 3643.32] responsibility and be be strict with
[3639.96 - 3646.00] their kids see in the modern day
[3643.32 - 3647.08] conveniences that liberalization of the
[3646.00 - 3650.28] country
[3647.08 - 3653.68] brought is huge right I mean we are all
[3650.28 - 3656.08] living it and enjoying it but along with
[3653.68 - 3657.68] that came the bane of some of these
[3656.08 - 3660.80] lifestyle
[3657.68 - 3663.64] diseases we have the advantage of seeing
[3660.80 - 3666.28] what it's done to the West let's learn
[3663.64 - 3668.68] from it and not make the same mistakes
[3666.28 - 3671.24] and wait as long yeah that those are
[3668.68 - 3673.28] wise words you know we touched about
[3671.24 - 3675.44] children and the office space and
[3673.28 - 3677.36] somewhere in our conversation Dr Mishu
[3675.44 - 3679.08] said that one of the biggest
[3677.36 - 3682.68] post-pandemic
[3679.08 - 3685.92] Targets on people's back was cancer The
[3682.68 - 3688.16] Big C right now are there any specific
[3685.92 - 3691.36] specific types of cancer that you are
[3688.16 - 3693.28] seeing at Apollo Healthcare on the rise
[3691.36 - 3696.24] uh and what age group are you seeing it
[3693.28 - 3698.52] and somebody watching in if they're in
[3696.24 - 3701.16] that age profile what are you telling a
[3698.52 - 3703.96] person in their 30s to 40s 40s to 50s
[3701.16 - 3705.96] 50s to 60 60 to 70 are they watching out
[3703.96 - 3708.32] for anything from a cancer screening
[3705.96 - 3709.92] point of view so cancer screening I
[3708.32 - 3712.60] think as the incident has picked up so
[3709.92 - 3714.56] has screening so for the L man and me
[3712.60 - 3715.64] also what do you mean by cancer
[3714.56 - 3718.16] screening I'm going to go in and going
[3715.64 - 3720.16] to a needle in me or what are the basic
[3718.16 - 3723.36] things that you do when you SC so you
[3720.16 - 3725.32] know for females for example um get a
[3723.36 - 3727.52] breast screening done whether it's an
[3725.32 - 3729.96] ultrasound or a mamogram and there are
[3727.52 - 3732.12] guidelines for it you know and then um
[3729.96 - 3734.24] get a papsmear done you know anually and
[3732.12 - 3737.28] then a colonoscopy every 10 years say
[3734.24 - 3739.76] after 50 years also yes yes yes because
[3737.28 - 3741.92] okay I thought only men get uh uh colon
[3739.76 - 3743.72] cancer I the incidence is higher but you
[3741.92 - 3746.88] know colon cancer is on the rise in the
[3743.72 - 3748.96] country across genders so these are and
[3746.88 - 3752.12] for men of course oral examination
[3748.96 - 3755.00] prostate uh and colonoscopy as I said uh
[3752.12 - 3757.60] because among men lung cancer prostate
[3755.00 - 3759.88] cancer cancer of the stomach esophagus
[3757.60 - 3762.24] head and neck cancers are on the rise
[3759.88 - 3764.76] highest incidents and on in females
[3762.24 - 3767.04] cervical breast and lung cancers in that
[3764.76 - 3768.56] order and these cancer screenings that
[3767.04 - 3771.32] you're doing you're also having the
[3768.56 - 3774.08] genetic screening done because I'm
[3771.32 - 3775.88] asking this question from a perspective
[3774.08 - 3778.88] can I blame my grandfather and
[3775.88 - 3781.32] grandparents or is this environment that
[3778.88 - 3782.96] is causing my cancer now so Ryan there's
[3781.32 - 3785.56] an expiry
[3782.96 - 3788.72] date for blaming your
[3785.56 - 3791.04] parents right there's an expiry date for
[3788.72 - 3792.96] blaming your parents I'm assuming I'm
[3791.04 - 3794.92] assuming it the day you say byebye mama
[3792.96 - 3797.40] papa and you leave the
[3794.92 - 3800.24] house I I think it's somewhere in your
[3797.40 - 3803.72] early 20s where you start to truly take
[3800.24 - 3807.80] charge um and own your life yeah I think
[3803.72 - 3811.64] um the uh challenge I have is that blood
[3807.80 - 3813.92] tests almost never catch the cancers
[3811.64 - 3817.48] until much much much too late in some
[3813.92 - 3823.40] cases not at all unless it is blood
[3817.48 - 3826.60] cancer um imaging radiology scans chest
[3823.40 - 3829.84] x-ray loo C whole body
[3826.60 - 3834.24] MRIs um mammograms
[3829.84 - 3836.48] ultrasounds colonoscopies this is what
[3834.24 - 3839.96] catches the cancers
[3836.48 - 3842.60] early right and therefore making sure
[3839.96 - 3846.28] that based on your
[3842.60 - 3850.16] age and family history that is anyone
[3846.28 - 3853.28] close to you who you may know has had a
[3850.16 - 3855.24] cancer please then regularly screen
[3853.28 - 3858.48] yourselves and regularly means at least
[3855.24 - 3860.00] once a year once a year yes for some
[3858.48 - 3862.12] right like he said colonoscopy you need
[3860.00 - 3864.28] once in 10 years papsmear you need once
[3862.12 - 3866.16] in 3 years as long as you're clear so
[3864.28 - 3867.64] there are guidelines and this is what
[3866.16 - 3870.88] also feeds into our personalization
[3867.64 - 3872.72] engine as well so if I have a family
[3870.88 - 3875.68] history of breast cancer on the maternal
[3872.72 - 3878.32] side my chance of breast cancer is very
[3875.68 - 3879.68] high and therefore I better start
[3878.32 - 3881.68] scanning at
[3879.68 - 3886.48] 35 every
[3881.68 - 3889.92] year but if I don't have that I still am
[3886.48 - 3893.36] uh a woman greater than 40 have a chance
[3889.92 - 3897.12] of getting breast cancer um please
[3893.36 - 3900.68] screen at least every other year
[3897.12 - 3903.68] for sure after 40 in our data at Apo we
[3900.68 - 3906.00] found that 25% of women who were
[3903.68 - 3906.80] diagnosed with breast cancer were less
[3906.00 - 3910.12] than
[3906.80 - 3914.92] 40 wow that's a that's a heartbreaking
[3910.12 - 3917.36] statistic yes why so the so it's all the
[3914.92 - 3920.60] more reason if you're younger than 40
[3917.36 - 3922.48] years a female to get tested just to
[3920.60 - 3926.16] rule out that you're not one of those
[3922.48 - 3927.80] 25% and early detection I think is one
[3926.16 - 3930.48] of the best things a person can do in
[3927.80 - 3933.32] cancer right yeah and you know that's
[3930.48 - 3935.64] one and I'll tell you the reason also
[3933.32 - 3938.00] because it's been found uh you know a
[3935.64 - 3940.20] study was done in UK uh by National
[3938.00 - 3943.96] Cancer registration and Analysis service
[3940.20 - 3946.68] that the more severe form of cancer um
[3943.96 - 3948.80] you know it it is the less the
[3946.68 - 3950.84] presentation the typical symptoms are
[3948.80 - 3952.72] lesser and difficult to diagnose for
[3950.84 - 3955.20] example you know brain tumor for example
[3952.72 - 3957.28] will present with head head headache and
[3955.20 - 3959.96] nuse and all which we can mistake for
[3957.28 - 3962.44] any other you know minor ailment
[3959.96 - 3964.28] indigestion can can be a symptom of
[3962.44 - 3966.68] stomach cancer but we don't take it
[3964.28 - 3969.60] seriously pancreatic cancer the symptoms
[3966.68 - 3971.20] are very atypical non-typical and
[3969.60 - 3973.20] perhaps can be ignored but that's the
[3971.20 - 3974.64] warning sign unless you get yourself
[3973.20 - 3976.72] screened every year there's no way of
[3974.64 - 3978.76] knowing and by the time they present in
[3976.72 - 3982.80] far more severe form it's already too
[3978.76 - 3986.12] late wow you know speaking of too late
[3982.80 - 3988.24] moving from the big sea to yes we're
[3986.12 - 3990.16] screening people people are getting more
[3988.24 - 3991.44] healthier there's the other end of
[3990.16 - 3995.84] spectrum where people are getting too
[3991.44 - 3998.96] healthy the gym goers the gym Buffs body
[3995.84 - 4002.00] transformation six six packs I can run
[3998.96 - 4004.36] 32 km after starting yesterday morning
[4002.00 - 4006.60] right so we have a lot of these flag
[4004.36 - 4008.48] bearers because in school they played
[4006.60 - 4010.16] for the ranji team or they were on the
[4008.48 - 4012.64] volleyball team or they won the swim
[4010.16 - 4015.04] team and like yeah I'm so fit and I've
[4012.64 - 4016.88] watched all this podcasts and fit India
[4015.04 - 4019.32] programs and all of these influencers
[4016.88 - 4021.76] and all and then suddenly you see a lot
[4019.32 - 4025.64] of people dropping dead yeah from heart
[4021.76 - 4030.60] attacks in gyms you know in marathon
[4025.64 - 4034.92] runners um so are we confusing ourself
[4030.60 - 4036.84] with Fit Body and healthy body doctor
[4034.92 - 4038.96] what's your take on this because when
[4036.84 - 4041.36] you're doing screening you're like the
[4038.96 - 4042.88] referee over there you're refering and
[4041.36 - 4045.52] you can see everyone on the playing
[4042.88 - 4047.52] field and you see this fit buff person
[4045.52 - 4050.08] who hasn't done screening and then you
[4047.52 - 4053.88] see this average Charlie who's done the
[4050.08 - 4056.48] screening so Fit Body or healthy body
[4053.88 - 4058.88] what's your take on this yeah so
[4056.48 - 4061.92] especially Jim goers marathon runners
[4058.88 - 4066.12] the organ for us to focus on here is the
[4061.92 - 4069.08] heart yeah and the most
[4066.12 - 4071.32] common um condition of the heart that
[4069.08 - 4074.28] we've all heard about is the heart
[4071.32 - 4077.32] attack that is caused by a
[4074.28 - 4080.68] clot and and that is a result of many
[4077.32 - 4084.08] years of plaque deposit inside Our
[4080.68 - 4085.76] arteries that hardens breaks off and a
[4084.08 - 4090.40] clot will go and
[4085.76 - 4093.04] block a blood vessel and then that area
[4090.40 - 4096.24] will not be able to get oxygen from the
[4093.04 - 4098.80] blood and hence it ends up being a
[4096.24 - 4101.76] problem when that blood vessel is
[4098.80 - 4104.28] actually in the Heart Right it causes a
[4101.76 - 4105.68] heart attack that's the most common
[4104.28 - 4109.92] thing that we've all heard of and that
[4105.68 - 4112.28] comes from years of unfit lifestyle and
[4109.92 - 4116.48] diet and lack of uh activity and so
[4112.28 - 4119.36] forth however the heart is actually a
[4116.48 - 4122.00] amazing organ it requires electrical
[4119.36 - 4124.80] impulses at a regular
[4122.00 - 4128.80] frequency for it to
[4124.80 - 4129.88] beat it also requires muscles to be able
[4128.80 - 4133.72] to
[4129.88 - 4138.32] pump the blood enough so that it reaches
[4133.72 - 4142.56] the Tippy Toe and and the corner of your
[4138.32 - 4145.52] brain when you put the heart under
[4142.56 - 4147.04] stress while your arteries may be clean
[4145.52 - 4148.68] because you're eating very well and
[4147.04 - 4151.52] you're extremely
[4148.68 - 4154.08] active it may actually come in the way
[4151.52 - 4157.48] of the electrical activity and the
[4154.08 - 4159.80] pumping activity and that's what sudden
[4157.48 - 4163.92] cardiac death or people suddenly
[4159.80 - 4166.00] dropping debt actually comes from so
[4163.92 - 4169.40] doctor I'm just thinking about everybody
[4166.00 - 4170.60] who watches my podcast at some point
[4169.40 - 4172.64] they want to work
[4170.60 - 4174.04] out oh you're talking about head
[4172.64 - 4176.12] screening oh you're talking about
[4174.04 - 4178.04] exercise oh you're talking about diet
[4176.12 - 4181.40] I'm going to start exercising and
[4178.04 - 4181.40] everyone goes into fourth gear
[4182.04 - 4188.16] suddenly is there any test that they can
[4185.12 - 4190.52] do at Apollo Healthcare preventive
[4188.16 - 4194.92] healthare that will give them some sort
[4190.52 - 4196.52] of indication K by go slow or go all out
[4194.92 - 4199.84] is is is there anything that we can
[4196.52 - 4201.60] discover there is AP poloo uh Pro Health
[4199.84 - 4203.16] heart screening package if you ask me
[4201.60 - 4205.36] for somebody who's interested in doing
[4203.16 - 4207.32] this that's actually a short short test
[4205.36 - 4209.64] to know whether you are fit enough to
[4207.32 - 4211.36] take take up these R vigorous physical
[4209.64 - 4213.40] exercises you will get patients that you
[4211.36 - 4215.60] will have to tell them go easy glow
[4213.40 - 4218.08] absolutely absolutely I mean and they
[4215.60 - 4221.60] look young oh yeah many of them I mean
[4218.08 - 4224.20] we've had patients in the early 20s
[4221.60 - 4227.04] coming in with with an esia with you
[4224.20 - 4229.44] know with with a heart ariia means what
[4227.04 - 4232.56] irregular heartbeat irular heartbe is
[4229.44 - 4235.32] this inherited or this is a lifestyle
[4232.56 - 4238.16] because I'm asking this question if I if
[4235.32 - 4239.68] I had arhythmia oh where did I get it do
[4238.16 - 4241.88] I look at my parents or do I look at my
[4239.68 - 4243.96] diet I think it could be both Aria could
[4241.88 - 4246.08] be a result of a lesion that you have in
[4243.96 - 4248.04] your heart because of a previous heart
[4246.08 - 4249.96] attack so it could be linked to your
[4248.04 - 4252.64] history or your lifestyle and these
[4249.96 - 4255.76] conditions are maintainable
[4252.64 - 4257.60] reversible uh or every condition I would
[4255.76 - 4261.28] say manageable is the
[4257.60 - 4263.60] one I think reversible is uh used too
[4261.28 - 4265.28] Loosely today yeah everyone wants damage
[4263.60 - 4268.52] is done
[4265.28 - 4272.52] yeah it depends on how much damage now
[4268.52 - 4276.48] yes right so uh if if a home is
[4272.52 - 4279.44] damaged slight damage we can fix and
[4276.48 - 4281.68] correct and it will look as good as new
[4279.44 - 4284.16] and even feel and maybe it's or if you
[4281.68 - 4286.12] maintain your house very well then it do
[4284.16 - 4290.52] doesn't get damaged that often but if
[4286.12 - 4293.56] the foundation is off and the damage has
[4290.52 - 4295.80] been there for 20 years and you didn't
[4293.56 - 4298.48] even know because you didn't get
[4295.80 - 4300.60] screened and it's shown up as a symptom
[4298.48 - 4302.64] then I don't think a reversible is
[4300.60 - 4304.96] possible what you can do is manage
[4302.64 - 4307.60] manage and I also want to come in that
[4304.96 - 4310.36] point of marathonas you know having
[4307.60 - 4312.16] these sudden cardiac arest and all I
[4310.36 - 4314.80] think it's important to get the
[4312.16 - 4316.88] underlying heart condition checked which
[4314.80 - 4318.52] has been aggravated by you know a
[4316.88 - 4320.64] symptom called I mean A syndrome called
[4318.52 - 4323.28] long covid the long-term effects of
[4320.64 - 4325.56] covid which we are seeing across um
[4323.28 - 4327.40] genders across age groups and all so I
[4325.56 - 4330.08] think the propensity of people to have
[4327.40 - 4332.36] these issues postco has increased um
[4330.08 - 4334.04] chest high cholesterol level diabetes
[4332.36 - 4336.32] incidents hypertension and so on and so
[4334.04 - 4339.00] forth so we have to be very very mindful
[4336.32 - 4342.00] coupled with the fact that many of these
[4339.00 - 4344.28] um you know victims have had vigorous F
[4342.00 - 4345.92] physical exercise and an undetected
[4344.28 - 4348.56] underlying condition
[4345.92 - 4351.00] that's led to these incidents that we
[4348.56 - 4353.52] have seen in the past and I think the
[4351.00 - 4355.24] other uh realization is also that our
[4353.52 - 4357.52] body is very interconnected it's not
[4355.24 - 4360.16] like one organ is independent another
[4357.52 - 4362.60] right and so when um when you have such
[4360.16 - 4366.12] vigorous activity the lung and the heart
[4362.60 - 4369.28] have to be in such s with one another so
[4366.12 - 4372.20] a V2 Max test with along with a
[4369.28 - 4375.68] treadmill allows us to see under the
[4372.20 - 4377.72] conditions of such endurance and stress
[4375.68 - 4380.32] how does your heart and lung perform
[4377.72 - 4383.88] together and therefore are you ready
[4380.32 - 4385.40] otherwise an ECG Echo and TMT treadmill
[4383.88 - 4387.64] test this
[4385.40 - 4390.12] combination can actually tell you what
[4387.64 - 4391.76] your current heart condition is and ECG
[4390.12 - 4393.88] will detect the heartbeat in the
[4391.76 - 4397.20] electrical activity the echo is about
[4393.88 - 4399.08] the pumping and the treadmill test is
[4397.20 - 4401.48] about placing the heart under a little
[4399.08 - 4404.52] bit of stress increasingly and seeing
[4401.48 - 4406.20] how you respond and how the um ECG the
[4404.52 - 4409.28] pumping as well as the electrical
[4406.20 - 4411.28] activity response in that context so
[4409.28 - 4413.96] let's not mistake a Fit Body for a
[4411.28 - 4415.96] healthy body that's the mistake people
[4413.96 - 4418.96] are making very commonly these days yeah
[4415.96 - 4422.72] and I think because of lack of time
[4418.96 - 4427.36] everyone's trying to get this uh instant
[4422.72 - 4429.08] body instant result instant health and
[4427.36 - 4430.52] so even when they're doing their Fitness
[4429.08 - 4432.72] they're doing this instant Fitness and
[4430.52 - 4436.88] that instant Fitness is actually a very
[4432.72 - 4439.44] high level of Expert Fitness yeah and I
[4436.88 - 4442.12] think also we have to caution the
[4439.44 - 4445.24] workout industry right yeah absolutely
[4442.12 - 4448.12] the trainer is given a certain pressure
[4445.24 - 4450.40] to deliver a certain result very quickly
[4448.12 - 4452.64] and I think the the sports trainer the
[4450.40 - 4455.28] athletic trainers the physio trainers
[4452.64 - 4457.40] have to work with the industry and their
[4455.28 - 4460.12] client and say like slow and steady wins
[4457.40 - 4463.12] the race you know and uh do you do
[4460.12 - 4465.96] anything like a body fat percentage test
[4463.12 - 4468.40] yes so we actually do the body fat
[4465.96 - 4471.32] composition analyzer right which
[4468.40 - 4473.76] actually gives you a sense for uh not
[4471.32 - 4475.64] just BMI right that's okay an easy
[4473.76 - 4478.48] metric that many people know the body
[4475.64 - 4482.00] mass index but I think um how much
[4478.48 - 4484.32] visceral fat do you have and that means
[4482.00 - 4486.84] how much of your fat around the
[4484.32 - 4489.36] abdominal organs right around your
[4486.84 - 4491.56] organs do you have that's actually far
[4489.36 - 4494.08] worse than what I'm going to call the
[4491.56 - 4496.52] total fat or in your periphery right so
[4494.08 - 4498.44] it's okay to carry a little bit of fat
[4496.52 - 4500.44] in your thighs and your hips and your
[4498.44 - 4504.04] buttocks right but not so much in your
[4500.44 - 4507.48] abdominal region um it also gives you a
[4504.04 - 4510.00] sense for your basil metabolic rate
[4507.48 - 4513.72] which means when you're at a resting
[4510.00 - 4518.08] state typically sleeping what is the
[4513.72 - 4520.52] metabolic rate of your body at that time
[4518.08 - 4523.68] the challenge with sitting without
[4520.52 - 4525.76] moving for 30 to 45 minutes is that our
[4523.68 - 4529.12] body thinks we are in a little bit of a
[4525.76 - 4531.96] resting state and the basil metabolic
[4529.12 - 4534.12] rate drops to as if you were
[4531.96 - 4535.92] sleeping that means when you reach out
[4534.12 - 4537.56] and have that sugar cookie and drink
[4535.92 - 4540.52] that chai with oh it's going to the
[4537.56 - 4543.56] liver it's going to the liver exactly
[4540.52 - 4546.84] and it's not metabolizing it
[4543.56 - 4550.20] even as well as it should and so the
[4546.84 - 4554.32] body composition analyzer allows us much
[4550.20 - 4556.20] more insight into what to do next you
[4554.32 - 4557.96] know why I asked this question because
[4556.20 - 4559.68] everyone joins the gym or goes Marathon
[4557.96 - 4562.68] running to lose the fat that they gained
[4559.68 - 4565.36] over 20 years from college into their
[4562.68 - 4567.56] first job second job Shadi having two
[4565.36 - 4571.44] kids and then they need to lose it fast
[4567.56 - 4574.20] but they don't know that to burn one kg
[4571.44 - 4576.92] of fat requires slow walking of 2 hours
[4574.20 - 4580.36] every day for one month because you have
[4576.92 - 4583.28] to be in that fat burn zone right not
[4580.36 - 4585.88] running that puts you in a cardiac Zone
[4583.28 - 4588.08] which is great for your cardio but not
[4585.88 - 4590.64] doesn't burn your fat as easily you've
[4588.08 - 4592.36] heard it there first from the doctor fat
[4590.64 - 4595.16] burning and I have been always been
[4592.36 - 4597.84] saying this I told even Amir Khan in his
[4595.16 - 4600.88] dungle movie role he has to walk 38,000
[4597.84 - 4603.44] steps to lose fat you have to walk to
[4600.88 - 4607.24] lose fat you don't need a Fit Body
[4603.44 - 4610.08] running like usin bolt or kennet bner
[4607.24 - 4612.40] you need to walk and have patience to
[4610.08 - 4614.48] get to that goal and always do a health
[4612.40 - 4617.52] screening now when you're speaking of
[4614.48 - 4620.40] screening we got the Fit Body 80% of
[4617.52 - 4622.00] gyming audience in India is male what
[4620.40 - 4623.48] about the female I know we talked a
[4622.00 - 4627.24] little bit about breast cancer screening
[4623.48 - 4628.96] and all but quickly what are the bang
[4627.24 - 4630.60] bang bang bang scans that a woman has to
[4628.96 - 4632.52] do because most women I meet they're
[4630.60 - 4635.12] always in the hurry managing the home
[4632.52 - 4636.48] managing the family managing everything
[4635.12 - 4639.32] right so they like they don't have time
[4636.48 - 4642.12] to do lots of stuff so quickly what
[4639.32 - 4645.32] should a woman do for all her
[4642.12 - 4648.40] screenings um definitely a dexas can
[4645.32 - 4651.64] dexas scan what's that bone density as
[4648.40 - 4656.00] well as muscle bone density and muscle
[4651.64 - 4658.44] um heart after menopause heart after
[4656.00 - 4662.60] menopause because your hormones actually
[4658.44 - 4666.12] protect you estrogen and so forth before
[4662.60 - 4670.04] menopause um the mammograms we talked
[4666.12 - 4672.12] about paps cervical cancer as early as
[4670.04 - 4675.60] possible and if you're really young then
[4672.12 - 4678.00] please get the vaccination HPV vacc
[4675.60 - 4679.36] far more protective and my generation
[4678.00 - 4681.96] didn't have
[4679.36 - 4685.24] it I think the only other one I will
[4681.96 - 4687.60] actually highlight here is uh cognitive
[4685.24 - 4690.60] screening cognitive screening and that
[4687.60 - 4693.52] means figuring out your brain function
[4690.60 - 4697.48] and the reason I say this is uh we're
[4693.52 - 4700.28] seeing also that perhaps because of the
[4697.48 - 4705.12] many many priorities we juggle and hold
[4700.28 - 4708.20] on to the stress there is a Slowdown of
[4705.12 - 4710.92] the brain function much later in life
[4708.20 - 4713.76] manifesting as memory losses dementias
[4710.92 - 4715.96] and so forth and so please find a way to
[4713.76 - 4718.64] do some cognitive screening husbands if
[4715.96 - 4722.36] you heard this in this is what you need
[4718.64 - 4724.24] to do don't get angry at your wife take
[4722.36 - 4727.32] her to a poo Healthcare and get her
[4724.24 - 4729.04] screening done because Dr Satya said so
[4727.32 - 4732.08] not
[4729.04 - 4733.72] you so there's one part that I want to
[4732.08 - 4735.48] ask because I get a lot of young
[4733.72 - 4737.52] athletes
[4735.48 - 4740.36] and I don't know if this is relevant to
[4737.52 - 4742.76] preventive healthc care screening but
[4740.36 - 4745.36] all the female athletes I work with from
[4742.76 - 4748.12] the age of 12 their first menstruation
[4745.36 - 4751.20] cycle till maybe even their marriage
[4748.12 - 4755.68] they have never met a gynecologist
[4751.20 - 4759.76] doctor how important is it for a young
[4755.68 - 4763.72] female girl a young lady yes to go and
[4759.76 - 4767.04] meet a gynecologist even if nothing is
[4763.72 - 4769.00] wrong um so it's a great question Ryan I
[4767.04 - 4771.52] think firstly definitely meet the
[4769.00 - 4774.08] pediatrician pediatrician yes because
[4771.52 - 4778.04] the pediatrician is trained up around
[4774.08 - 4779.52] multiple facets including the puberty
[4778.04 - 4783.16] right and sort of what I'm going to call
[4779.52 - 4785.44] Early fertility period um so that means
[4783.16 - 4788.92] when the girl first gets her menstration
[4785.44 - 4791.88] cycle the pediatrician is a great person
[4788.92 - 4795.00] to have a touch waste with absolutely
[4791.88 - 4797.28] because it the pediatrician all then can
[4795.00 - 4799.08] decide if there is anything that we
[4797.28 - 4801.44] should be watching for allows the
[4799.08 - 4803.64] pediatrician to educate the parent and
[4801.44 - 4805.52] the girl child to be aware we have a lot
[4803.64 - 4808.56] of teenage weight gain nowadays in the
[4805.52 - 4812.72] female athlet yes so uh is that towards
[4808.56 - 4816.28] the pcod condition so uh the polycystic
[4812.72 - 4819.56] ovar um syndrome is actually on the rise
[4816.28 - 4821.64] and impacting fertility are we testing
[4819.56 - 4825.56] this in a preventive Health Care setup
[4821.64 - 4828.20] so the way we would test for this is um
[4825.56 - 4829.88] through hormones and the hormone panel
[4828.20 - 4832.36] and we absolutely do it thyroid
[4829.88 - 4834.92] typically comes up as the number one so
[4832.36 - 4837.88] we have thyroid stimulating hormone test
[4834.92 - 4840.00] um included in our women panels um we
[4837.88 - 4842.96] also make sure that if someone is
[4840.00 - 4846.20] overweight or a bees then we throw in a
[4842.96 - 4849.76] hormonal panel um and then there is
[4846.20 - 4852.04] questions around your menstrual cycle I
[4849.76 - 4855.76] think it's very important for women to
[4852.04 - 4858.24] find a way to make note and understand
[4855.76 - 4860.68] any pack Downs or trends that they're
[4858.24 - 4863.80] seeing there are apps on the phone we
[4860.68 - 4866.48] are married to our phones um and enough
[4863.80 - 4868.16] of this is available and If not go
[4866.48 - 4870.72] oldfashioned
[4868.16 - 4872.84] calendar in you know either the digital
[4870.72 - 4875.36] format or noted down so if a woman's
[4872.84 - 4877.52] cycle is 28 to 30 days she's good but if
[4875.36 - 4879.16] it's skipping or missing yes then maybe
[4877.52 - 4880.92] pick up the phone and talk to a guy and
[4879.16 - 4883.92] then in between spotting that's another
[4880.92 - 4885.44] one okay so in between spotting ladies
[4883.92 - 4887.48] please watch for that and we're talking
[4885.44 - 4889.36] about the youngsters yes many of them
[4887.48 - 4892.48] will go and meet a gynecologist after
[4889.36 - 4895.32] marriage for birth control or for
[4892.48 - 4897.48] fertility but I am seeing girls in much
[4895.32 - 4899.56] younger ages not doing this so you could
[4897.48 - 4902.92] get yourself screened with a good
[4899.56 - 4905.32] gynecologist Now we move into the part
[4902.92 - 4908.24] where not only girls and boys but
[4905.32 - 4910.12] everyone at all age has this stress
[4908.24 - 4912.24] problem now I don't know whether
[4910.12 - 4915.80] preventive healthc care
[4912.24 - 4917.44] screening um throw light on this but
[4915.80 - 4919.20] obviously you have all of this data and
[4917.44 - 4921.40] screening all of these
[4919.20 - 4924.52] people we know we need to get screened
[4921.40 - 4928.00] yes that's that's a given right now some
[4924.52 - 4931.88] tips from Dr Satya in terms of stress
[4928.00 - 4934.04] and sleep oh how important are these two
[4931.88 - 4935.48] are they married to each other and are
[4934.04 - 4938.36] there any insights you would like to
[4935.48 - 4941.52] share with our audience so um stress and
[4938.36 - 4945.40] sleep are uh collaborate with one
[4941.52 - 4947.20] another and also then cause a number of
[4945.40 - 4949.16] physical changes that lead to the
[4947.20 - 4951.68] downstream non-communicable diseases
[4949.16 - 4955.12] we've been talking about um I am going
[4951.68 - 4957.52] to go straight to the hacks and the tips
[4955.12 - 4959.72] um Ryan I think uh when it comes to
[4957.52 - 4963.52] stress I think uh it's a very very
[4959.72 - 4968.32] important to find a way to declutter
[4963.52 - 4970.44] your brain every day we get about 23 to
[4968.32 - 4973.36] 25 GB
[4970.44 - 4975.92] worth of information that our brain has
[4973.36 - 4978.08] to process wow
[4975.92 - 4980.04] right so think about your computers and
[4978.08 - 4983.12] when it crashes and the hard disk
[4980.04 - 4986.52] essentially stress levels are related to
[4983.12 - 4988.76] how much processing you're doing and not
[4986.52 - 4991.60] allowing your brain to figure out what's
[4988.76 - 4995.92] important to keep what to
[4991.60 - 4998.80] discard and what to not worry about so
[4995.92 - 5000.88] decluttering is important and that comes
[4998.80 - 5003.48] in a number of different ways it could
[5000.88 - 5006.08] be taking a very very short mini break
[5003.48 - 5007.60] to a place that is away from a city so
[5006.08 - 5009.96] that you just have less visual
[5007.60 - 5013.20] stimulation it could be locking yourself
[5009.96 - 5014.68] up and just reading a book with nobody
[5013.20 - 5018.32] around you because then you're focused
[5014.68 - 5023.32] only on one thing the words on the page
[5018.32 - 5025.36] it could be uh doing yoga and uh staying
[5023.32 - 5028.20] through the shavasana because it's
[5025.36 - 5030.68] really important part of decluttering
[5028.20 - 5033.68] your brain and it could be ensuring that
[5030.68 - 5037.12] you actually get enough and good quality
[5033.68 - 5039.64] sleep I think sleep in at least our
[5037.12 - 5042.88] research findings for people who come um
[5039.64 - 5044.60] to Apollo we find is correlated with
[5042.88 - 5047.28] diabetes and
[5044.60 - 5049.76] hypertension and the risk of that goes
[5047.28 - 5051.60] up so we've Incorporated sleep screening
[5049.76 - 5054.32] and stress screening as part of TR
[5051.60 - 5056.44] Health as well and there are so many
[5054.32 - 5058.84] different ways we all hear it from so
[5056.44 - 5061.92] many influencers don't look at the blue
[5058.84 - 5064.04] light turn off your TV 1 hour before
[5061.92 - 5066.56] sleeping but guess what that's also the
[5064.04 - 5069.84] time we want to binge watch and use our
[5066.56 - 5071.88] Netflix and Amazon Prime accounts right
[5069.84 - 5073.88] um so we may need to figure out okay
[5071.88 - 5077.04] after that binge watching can I do a
[5073.88 - 5082.44] 15minute meditation app that allows me
[5077.04 - 5085.28] to go uh calm down and sleep um is it a
[5082.44 - 5087.52] Epsom salt soak while I'm binge watching
[5085.28 - 5088.88] Netflix so that I'm able to actually
[5087.52 - 5090.84] smiling because I do a lot of the deps
[5088.88 - 5092.48] in all soak and it really works it
[5090.84 - 5094.76] worked for me by the way it worked for
[5092.48 - 5096.04] me I had such a big sleep problem
[5094.76 - 5098.04] because of all the stress and I had to
[5096.04 - 5099.52] figure out solutions that would work for
[5098.04 - 5101.28] me only then can I share it with other
[5099.52 - 5103.36] people and epsom salt soap was one of
[5101.28 - 5105.12] those and so these are the quick hacks
[5103.36 - 5108.16] and tips that I would share with people
[5105.12 - 5111.88] to please proactively manage uh sleep
[5108.16 - 5113.76] and stress it has crept into our lives
[5111.88 - 5116.64] um and is less talked about than diet
[5113.76 - 5118.60] and life and physical activity um so
[5116.64 - 5120.56] please be mindful of it and see how we
[5118.60 - 5122.56] can actually proactively manage it and
[5120.56 - 5125.20] and lack of good sleep has been found to
[5122.56 - 5127.44] be a big contributing factor factor to
[5125.20 - 5130.32] these sudden cardiac deaths that we just
[5127.44 - 5131.84] spoke about yeah you know Dr Manesh I
[5130.32 - 5136.84] remember reading this line from the
[5131.84 - 5139.40] Netflix CEO he said we are on a war with
[5136.84 - 5142.80] sleep so if you think about it you can
[5139.40 - 5145.40] binge watch into your Saturday night and
[5142.80 - 5147.48] Sunday night and turn up like a zombie
[5145.40 - 5151.92] at work and then have to download that
[5147.48 - 5153.88] 25 GB and work for the next 5 days that
[5151.92 - 5155.60] brain processor is overheating and
[5153.88 - 5157.80] that's your stress at the end of the day
[5155.60 - 5160.28] it's not changing anytime soon our
[5157.80 - 5162.48] lifestyle is not going to change anytime
[5160.28 - 5165.60] soon I think the wisdom has to come from
[5162.48 - 5168.24] the ancient behaviors that we had or the
[5165.60 - 5170.44] text that we had but the modern day
[5168.24 - 5172.04] screening that kind of gives you a
[5170.44 - 5174.48] little bit of cold water thrown on your
[5172.04 - 5176.56] face saying wake up buddy yes you know
[5174.48 - 5178.08] the you have these issues speaking of
[5176.56 - 5180.32] cold water being thrown on all of our
[5178.08 - 5182.20] face as a sports
[5180.32 - 5184.96] nutritionist I constantly have to
[5182.20 - 5188.20] motivate my athletes and I've been
[5184.96 - 5190.36] practicing for two decades now and I'm
[5188.20 - 5192.76] noticing a lot more of the younger
[5190.36 - 5194.96] generation maybe in the last 10 years I
[5192.76 - 5197.76] don't know whether it's the environment
[5194.96 - 5200.68] the food or the pressure of the fast
[5197.76 - 5203.12] space of life but mental health problems
[5200.68 - 5206.28] have cropped
[5203.12 - 5209.32] up how do we first find that I have a
[5206.28 - 5212.44] mental problem how do I know is there
[5209.32 - 5213.92] any secret out there that says oh I'm
[5212.44 - 5215.52] facing this and I'm beginning to break
[5213.92 - 5218.20] down because I think a lot of my
[5215.52 - 5220.80] athletes are waiting too late before
[5218.20 - 5223.48] they come in so from a health care
[5220.80 - 5225.64] perspective how can we manage it or how
[5223.48 - 5227.60] can I I think before we manage it one is
[5225.64 - 5230.56] to detect it and then is to manage it so
[5227.60 - 5234.00] any words of wisdom or insights that you
[5230.56 - 5237.12] guys have in our Hospital experience um
[5234.00 - 5239.40] we've seen that the stigma that used to
[5237.12 - 5241.72] be associated with mental health issues
[5239.40 - 5243.48] has come down significantly after covid
[5241.72 - 5244.92] C actually was the inflection point
[5243.48 - 5247.64] where people started talking about it a
[5244.92 - 5250.24] lot so in fact our you know op consults
[5247.64 - 5252.64] for psychologists and psychiatrists have
[5250.24 - 5255.00] almost you know multiplied three three
[5252.64 - 5256.80] times uh since covid so that's the kind
[5255.00 - 5259.44] of influx we're seeing because people
[5256.80 - 5261.16] are accepting mental health issues as so
[5259.44 - 5263.76] there's a normalization of mental health
[5261.16 - 5265.00] issues um so I think they were Al always
[5263.76 - 5266.80] there I mean these issues but I think
[5265.00 - 5269.88] people are recognizing them early on
[5266.80 - 5271.28] anding for help asking for help so I
[5269.88 - 5273.12] think the first step is to recognize and
[5271.28 - 5274.52] seek help which I think is you know
[5273.12 - 5276.44] changed a lot in the last last three
[5274.52 - 5277.44] years so that's I think one step and
[5276.44 - 5279.96] then of course there are several
[5277.44 - 5281.48] therapies available now U you know
[5279.96 - 5283.72] psychotherapies there are there is
[5281.48 - 5285.64] medication management which is available
[5283.72 - 5288.44] um so and mental health from that
[5285.64 - 5289.84] standpoint is fairly controllable now
[5288.44 - 5291.52] many of these conditions because I think
[5289.84 - 5292.28] there are a lot of new drugs available
[5291.52 - 5294.68] in the
[5292.28 - 5297.00] market uh you know I've seen friends and
[5294.68 - 5299.28] family seek help and get treated you
[5297.00 - 5301.32] know very fast which wasn't the case
[5299.28 - 5302.68] perhaps 10 years 10 20 years back so I
[5301.32 - 5305.52] think that's a big advancement that has
[5302.68 - 5307.76] happened so I I guess seek early help
[5305.52 - 5309.52] facilities are available now Co has
[5307.76 - 5311.44] changed that and many drugs that are
[5309.52 - 5314.20] available today I mean not to speak of
[5311.44 - 5315.56] other therapies like yoga and meditation
[5314.20 - 5316.96] um but I think there's room for many
[5315.56 - 5319.88] such therapies out there in the market
[5316.96 - 5321.80] today I think in addition um the point
[5319.88 - 5325.64] we discussed earlier about a community
[5321.80 - 5328.64] around you um it may be hard for you to
[5325.64 - 5331.16] recognize it and come to terms with it
[5328.64 - 5334.20] but if you have a community around you
[5331.16 - 5337.12] that you have been mindful with then um
[5334.20 - 5339.84] um they will recognize it for you right
[5337.12 - 5342.72] and I think it therefore is every one of
[5339.84 - 5345.16] our responsibilities to watch for the
[5342.72 - 5346.88] people around us uh whether it is at
[5345.16 - 5349.80] work whether it is in our social
[5346.88 - 5351.68] communities or in our families um and to
[5349.80 - 5354.64] pick up these little
[5351.68 - 5358.16] signs um it could be someone who is not
[5354.64 - 5360.28] paying attention uh the way they used to
[5358.16 - 5363.68] someone who's very distracted someone
[5360.28 - 5366.44] who Slips Away into social isolation
[5363.68 - 5369.04] doesn't join a number of the activities
[5366.44 - 5370.76] that we do and then be able to have a
[5369.04 - 5373.04] conversation or get somebody who is
[5370.76 - 5377.36] trained to have a conversation and help
[5373.04 - 5380.40] that individual recognize it um we I
[5377.36 - 5384.76] think have heard that sitting is the new
[5380.40 - 5386.84] smoking um what we've realized in a post
[5384.76 - 5388.16] pandemic world is that loneliness and
[5386.84 - 5391.32] social
[5388.16 - 5394.76] isolation is the new sitting and the new
[5391.32 - 5397.60] smoking I've heard that it's as bad as
[5394.76 - 5400.08] smoking 15 20 cigarettes a day in terms
[5397.60 - 5402.16] of the kind of damage that it does
[5400.08 - 5405.88] without you even realizing
[5402.16 - 5408.52] it wow that's profound loneliness and
[5405.88 - 5410.60] social isolation social
[5408.52 - 5413.60] isolation yeah and we come to think of
[5410.60 - 5416.72] it know we always in our phones and we
[5413.60 - 5419.92] tend to find that as an easier companion
[5416.72 - 5422.80] than the community around us and you
[5419.92 - 5425.28] know what's more worrying is the impact
[5422.80 - 5428.32] mental health issues are having on our
[5425.28 - 5431.76] kids today and adolescents that I think
[5428.32 - 5435.44] is a tiing time bomb because as adults
[5431.76 - 5437.40] we still have some um you know agency to
[5435.44 - 5439.36] deal with these issues because of her
[5437.40 - 5440.92] experience but kids have nowhere to go
[5439.36 - 5442.80] adolesence have know where to go they
[5440.92 - 5444.88] take a long time figuring out what's
[5442.80 - 5448.16] wrong with
[5444.88 - 5451.24] them so taking time bomb I mean there's
[5448.16 - 5454.84] a lot that we have to do uh to help
[5451.24 - 5457.16] Society at large now as a country
[5454.84 - 5459.84] uh the whole country there are a lot of
[5457.16 - 5461.40] these casualties happening from
[5459.84 - 5465.84] non-communicable
[5461.40 - 5470.92] diseases what can we do to reduce
[5465.84 - 5473.60] that um I think uh definitely screening
[5470.92 - 5475.84] and we've designed Pro Health to be able
[5473.60 - 5478.12] to take care of it at a personalized
[5475.84 - 5480.48] level and to be able to help you figure
[5478.12 - 5483.24] out what the next steps are um once
[5480.48 - 5485.96] you've done that I also am going to
[5483.24 - 5488.48] appeal to to um companies and
[5485.96 - 5490.08] organizations that uh do and have the
[5488.48 - 5494.08] luxury of funding
[5490.08 - 5496.56] CSR so our screenings need to go beyond
[5494.08 - 5499.28] those who can afford it so one second
[5496.56 - 5501.20] you mean to say if a company has more
[5499.28 - 5503.32] profit they we give that to a corporate
[5501.20 - 5505.64] social responsibility they could
[5503.32 - 5508.40] actually take that money and test people
[5505.64 - 5510.68] and screen people yes those who can't
[5508.40 - 5514.32] necessarily afford it they could take
[5510.68 - 5516.96] care of the uh Urban poor uh rural areas
[5514.32 - 5519.04] semi-urban areas they could look at uh
[5516.96 - 5522.16] areas around their factories around
[5519.04 - 5524.96] their ports um and adopt those
[5522.16 - 5527.36] communities and Screen them so that
[5524.96 - 5530.92] we're able to actually reach much much
[5527.36 - 5534.68] more of India um and ensure that uh you
[5530.92 - 5539.04] know we have this silent epidemic that
[5534.68 - 5543.00] is going unnoticed under control in the
[5539.04 - 5544.36] country doctors your vision and the
[5543.00 - 5547.24] mission that you're on
[5544.36 - 5550.28] AT AP poo preventive Healthcare if you
[5547.24 - 5554.68] had to sum it up and tell us what is it
[5550.28 - 5557.00] that India needs from Apollo preventive
[5554.68 - 5558.60] Healthcare I think we need to be NCD
[5557.00 - 5563.80] free by
[5558.60 - 5566.00] 2040 as a country that's a tough ask and
[5563.80 - 5568.96] uh we've always risen to a challenge as
[5566.00 - 5571.00] a country and uh we have gotten
[5568.96 - 5573.08] Independence for the country and I think
[5571.00 - 5576.96] this is an alternate form of
[5573.08 - 5580.08] Independence for ourselves right um to
[5576.96 - 5583.08] ensure that we are living healthy for
[5580.08 - 5585.52] ourselves our families and for the
[5583.08 - 5589.12] country awesome it's been a pleasure
[5585.52 - 5591.20] talking to both of you today um if
[5589.12 - 5593.08] there's one thing that you did for your
[5591.20 - 5596.64] own personal
[5593.08 - 5599.08] health as a secret both of you could you
[5596.64 - 5603.96] share that with our
[5599.08 - 5606.92] viewers I started um you know I had a
[5603.96 - 5609.28] 10,000 Step Challenge which I started
[5606.92 - 5611.60] four months back you know I I mean I
[5609.28 - 5614.76] used to play sports but now I've you
[5611.60 - 5617.12] know like you said um 2 hours every day
[5614.76 - 5618.96] uh for a month to lose 1 kg I think I
[5617.12 - 5621.20] started on that drive four months back
[5618.96 - 5624.20] and it's really helping me a lot so
[5621.20 - 5626.08] 10,000 steps is your secret secret goal
[5624.20 - 5627.96] to I need to do this I mean a lot of
[5626.08 - 5630.56] other things it difficult to do that no
[5627.96 - 5632.72] actually it's very inv invigorating and
[5630.56 - 5634.60] I mean I I actually thought thought that
[5632.72 - 5636.08] you know playing sports was the be all
[5634.60 - 5638.04] and end all but I realized walking is a
[5636.08 - 5641.04] big contributor to good health and also
[5638.04 - 5642.88] changed dietary habits less of red meat
[5641.04 - 5645.12] more of salads and all which I thought I
[5642.88 - 5647.16] would never need but I think that's come
[5645.12 - 5650.08] as a wakeup call some months back
[5647.16 - 5651.56] because of some tests I ran and um so it
[5650.08 - 5653.44] was the testings that were part of the
[5651.56 - 5656.16] trigger yes screening was part of the
[5653.44 - 5658.40] trigger and which you know kind of you
[5656.16 - 5660.84] know nudged me towards adopting these
[5658.40 - 5664.24] healthy um Lifestyle Changes what with
[5660.84 - 5667.64] you Dr I've shared so many over there
[5664.24 - 5671.52] podcast let me um share one more um I
[5667.64 - 5674.88] think sugar sugar in our diet as a
[5671.52 - 5676.76] family um is something that we did uh my
[5674.88 - 5679.80] children grew up with uh no sugar in
[5676.76 - 5682.36] their milk uh no additives whatsoever
[5679.80 - 5684.72] but we as adults uh were pampered and
[5682.36 - 5686.84] had a lot of sugar in our lives um and
[5684.72 - 5689.04] the reason I say we went uh and did this
[5686.84 - 5691.48] as a family is because it helps the
[5689.04 - 5694.48] kitchen when you do things together and
[5691.48 - 5697.40] it helps each other um go through that
[5694.48 - 5701.04] withdrawal that I had when we stopped
[5697.40 - 5703.24] sugar it took us about um 10 to 14 days
[5701.04 - 5705.72] was that Rebellion from your kids no the
[5703.24 - 5709.16] kids were okay because they never uh had
[5705.72 - 5711.40] sugar um I ensured they weren't given a
[5709.16 - 5713.52] choice they weren't give it a choice and
[5711.40 - 5716.00] so now they when you add too much sugar
[5713.52 - 5717.88] they can't even handle it right but I
[5716.00 - 5721.52] think sugar in
[5717.88 - 5723.24] beverages that alone if we take care of
[5721.52 - 5726.48] then I'm not saying we don't enjoy the
[5723.24 - 5729.84] occasional myour park right or
[5726.48 - 5731.24] ragula we should that's part of life and
[5729.84 - 5733.12] that's part of actually having a good
[5731.24 - 5735.44] time it doesn't become main stay as a
[5733.12 - 5737.40] regular dozing that's right because we
[5735.44 - 5740.08] as Indians actually are consuming on
[5737.40 - 5743.32] average five times more sugar than the
[5740.08 - 5745.04] wh guidelines once again we're consuming
[5743.32 - 5747.48] so we're getting to become a developed
[5745.04 - 5749.88] nation and in that trajectory we
[5747.48 - 5752.56] consuming five times more sugar that's
[5749.88 - 5754.96] right and the sugar comes in the form of
[5752.56 - 5758.60] you know in your beverage briges much
[5754.96 - 5761.80] much more than you need um in biscuits
[5758.60 - 5765.80] and cookies that we snack on
[5761.80 - 5768.56] ketchup bread I mean I could go on right
[5765.80 - 5770.60] yeah so you're absolutely right because
[5768.56 - 5773.12] I remember creating a video on the
[5770.60 - 5776.52] national survey of consumption talking
[5773.12 - 5780.28] about India in the 1990s and India now
[5776.52 - 5783.20] and 2023 the the recent consumption Serv
[5780.28 - 5784.80] and so 100 rupes spent earlier it was 54
[5783.20 - 5786.68] rupes towards food obviously we didn't
[5784.80 - 5789.44] have that much money but now it's come
[5786.68 - 5792.48] down to 40 rupes correct but out of 40
[5789.44 - 5796.04] rupees 10 rupes 50 pisas towards
[5792.48 - 5798.32] processed foods and Beverages and only 3
[5796.04 - 5800.32] rupees 80 Pisa towards fruit and 3
[5798.32 - 5802.88] rupees 80 Pisa towards vegetable my
[5800.32 - 5804.36] goodness goodness that tells you right
[5802.88 - 5806.76] there what we're doing to ourselves
[5804.36 - 5810.08] absolutely so I think for everyone who
[5806.76 - 5813.04] is watching in you are
[5810.08 - 5815.88] educated you have the knowledge you have
[5813.04 - 5817.40] the ability to choose what you put into
[5815.88 - 5820.24] your body you have the ability to
[5817.40 - 5822.36] purchase what you put into your body you
[5820.24 - 5825.00] have the ability to purchase a screening
[5822.36 - 5827.00] program you have the ability to
[5825.00 - 5828.88] understand the screening test and
[5827.00 - 5831.96] finally you have the ability to take the
[5828.88 - 5834.76] decision either to have epsin salts in
[5831.96 - 5836.80] your bath or walk 10,000 steps or in my
[5834.76 - 5838.92] case having too much of nonv where my
[5836.80 - 5840.76] uric acid went through the roof and my I
[5838.92 - 5842.28] was wondering why my fingers hurting
[5840.76 - 5844.12] let's go and get a screening done there
[5842.28 - 5846.96] was a yogi Guru who said this this no I
[5844.12 - 5848.92] was going on a flight and the air the
[5846.96 - 5852.32] the airline baggage handler says sir you
[5848.92 - 5855.36] are overweight and he said who me or my
[5852.32 - 5857.36] bags so I think everyone has to go who
[5855.36 - 5859.04] has everyone has to go in that direction
[5857.36 - 5861.36] that you know only your bags are
[5859.04 - 5864.16] overweight but but not yourself not
[5861.36 - 5866.96] yourself absolutely less is more less is
[5864.16 - 5870.04] more absolutely so this has been a
[5866.96 - 5872.40] wonderful time with both you doctors I
[5870.04 - 5874.08] wish you all the success on your mission
[5872.40 - 5876.84] I hope you change
[5874.08 - 5879.00] millions and millions of lives and uh
