[0.12 - 6.60] to be what Comfort level are you at
[4.12 - 8.32] mentally physically and therefore your
[6.60 - 10.52] brain is much more productive in the
[8.32 - 12.96] workplace that makes sense so your feet
[10.52 - 15.76] are going to be like I'm because my feet
[12.96 - 18.08] my feet are hurting me yeah I wish wear
[15.76 - 20.60] shoes okay we can always knock off our
[18.08 - 23.36] shoes I think no nobody would
[20.60 - 26.00] mind but so you worked with all
[23.36 - 28.60] prominent celebrities who's who's of the
[26.00 - 30.52] country and you know even individuals
[28.60 - 32.64] High net worth individuals
[30.52 - 34.24] um what are some impactful stories that
[32.64 - 36.92] you might want to share about things you
[34.24 - 39.64] know that people should do again maybe
[36.92 - 41.72] not hinting towards theka specifically
[39.64 - 43.72] but generally you know all sort of
[41.72 - 45.76] people you work with certain impactful
[43.72 - 49.00] stories from where we could all draw
[45.76 - 52.04] parallels so about four or five years so
[49.00 - 54.96] before I um before the world found out
[52.04 - 58.28] who Ryan Fernando was I'd already done
[54.96 - 60.20] at least 100 celebrities so the addition
[58.28 - 63.00] of the title celebrity nutritionist was
[60.20 - 65.56] to create a marketing front because how
[63.00 - 66.72] do you convince individuals personally
[65.56 - 70.00] to take care of the health so you have
[66.72 - 72.68] the celebrities so the first story is
[70.00 - 75.36] why do these celebrities invest or these
[72.68 - 77.56] sports stars invest in their body or
[75.36 - 78.36] their diet or their healthare obviously
[77.56 - 82.08] their
[78.36 - 83.64] paycheck comes from what they do so they
[82.08 - 86.16] need to look good they need to shoot at
[83.64 - 88.72] odd hours they need to have that killer
[86.16 - 92.72] energy they take multiple takes for 18
[88.72 - 95.04] hours a day now you replace a celebrity
[92.72 - 97.88] and put each one of the HR heads over
[95.04 - 100.00] here as a celebrity you still work for a
[97.88 - 102.40] paycheck you're an Olympian in the
[100.00 - 106.44] office space and everyone who reports
[102.40 - 108.36] into you in in your company and I don't
[106.44 - 109.96] want to do this in a public forum but
[108.36 - 111.48] I'd be very interested to see how many
[109.96 - 115.16] startup Founders are sitting here in
[111.48 - 119.36] this forum the HR is always there to
[115.16 - 121.76] take care of the employee but does the
[119.36 - 124.08] guy who builds the company have the
[121.76 - 126.80] bandwidth to say that I'm the Shah ruk
[124.08 - 129.52] Khan of my life and the organization
[126.80 - 132.72] that I'm building everybody in that is a
[129.52 - 135.92] mini Shah ruk Khan so the story starts
[132.72 - 137.16] with I think everyone's a celebrity in
[135.92 - 141.04] their own
[137.16 - 142.92] life they just haven't learned it and in
[141.04 - 145.68] today's Forum I think it's a
[142.92 - 147.52] responsibility for HR to treat your
[145.68 - 149.60] employee like a
[147.52 - 150.64] rockstar but not give them too many
[149.60 - 154.52] benef
[150.64 - 156.40] benefits ask them to earn those benefits
[154.52 - 158.08] because when they earn the benefit they
[156.40 - 161.56] feel really good about it so the story
[158.08 - 165.40] goes like this okay um there was this
[161.56 - 167.52] gentleman um who was 72 years of age
[165.40 - 169.68] right and the perspective is I'll break
[167.52 - 171.92] it down for HR to convince your
[169.68 - 174.84] employees to bring in or your CEO or
[171.92 - 177.20] your CFO to bring in more Moola into the
[174.84 - 179.08] workplace to take care of employees so
[177.20 - 181.16] there was this gentleman 70y old he
[179.08 - 184.04] stands in the wing scale in my clinic
[181.16 - 185.40] his body age on the weighing scale is 75
[184.04 - 187.20] now each one of you can come to my
[185.40 - 189.44] clinic here in Bangalore anywhere in
[187.20 - 191.48] India you'll stand on a weighing scale
[189.44 - 193.32] you have your birth certificate age
[191.48 - 196.36] which is your driving license age and
[193.32 - 198.36] then you have a metabolic age biological
[196.36 - 201.28] age you stand on the wing scale so this
[198.36 - 203.96] guy was 75 but he was actually 72 years
[201.28 - 205.24] on driving license now with diabetes
[203.96 - 206.72] hypertension and this could be a
[205.24 - 208.76] 30-year-old in your organization this
[206.72 - 210.72] could be a 40y old in your
[208.76 - 212.04] organization this person stands on the
[210.72 - 215.12] wing skill and suddenly discovers
[212.04 - 219.12] they're 5 years older 5 years is okay
[215.12 - 222.88] but after 1 year of exercise that 15
[219.12 - 225.72] minutes of gardening correct
[222.88 - 229.12] nutrition his body age came down by 10
[225.72 - 232.96] years wow next lialia got this massive
[229.12 - 237.52] gift hamper from his son why he says
[232.96 - 241.40] Papa earns consultancy fee of 1 CR per
[237.52 - 243.00] year Papa now is 10 years younger I am
[241.40 - 245.60] 10 Crowes
[243.00 - 248.20] richer are you getting the perspective
[245.60 - 251.72] now you're laughing what if that's
[248.20 - 253.96] you what is your net worth today as a
[251.72 - 255.04] celebrity what is the net worth of your
[253.96 - 257.96] employee
[255.04 - 260.48] today and as they grow older like I've
[257.96 - 262.48] got my team over here and I'm doing
[260.48 - 266.12] breath work for them I'm getting them
[262.48 - 269.52] gym membership because if they are
[266.12 - 271.36] younger the organization laughs all the
[269.52 - 273.12] way way to the bank because you know all
[271.36 - 276.32] the studies out there say productivity
[273.12 - 279.56] Works enhancement loss of Manpower days
[276.32 - 282.28] is lesser the million dooll question is
[279.56 - 285.04] how do we get them to think like vat
[282.28 - 287.88] kohi that's a very interesting
[285.04 - 290.32] perspective any funny stories around
[287.88 - 292.00] something you want to share maybe you
[290.32 - 293.60] know take giving us the lesson of you
[292.00 - 297.32] know things that we shouldn't
[293.60 - 300.08] do so funny stories there are so many
[297.32 - 303.00] right um one of the funny stories
[300.08 - 305.04] happened in in in in a in a scenario of
[303.00 - 307.32] the corporate world so we were
[305.04 - 309.68] contracted by this Fortune 500 company
[307.32 - 311.96] so this is not the clinic okay so Clinic
[309.68 - 313.88] we are not there 24 bar7 so you walk
[311.96 - 317.28] into our clinic and we know you only for
[313.88 - 320.00] 1 hour but when we are embedded in as a
[317.28 - 323.16] clinic inside a corporate we are sitting
[320.00 - 326.88] there with the employees okay so one of
[323.16 - 329.84] the funny stories was um uh there was
[326.88 - 332.36] this organization we did a survey and
[329.84 - 336.88] and um one of the employees came in is
[332.36 - 340.72] like please get my boss to come in here
[336.88 - 342.72] so we were like why my boss is always
[340.72 - 345.36] angry first thing in the
[342.72 - 347.28] morning so I was like why is your boss
[345.36 - 349.32] angry in the we don't know the whole
[347.28 - 352.68] team just thinks he's angry there must
[349.32 - 354.68] be something in diet you can do now
[352.68 - 356.76] background story is whilst all of this
[354.68 - 360.04] is happening we were there for 6 months
[356.76 - 362.68] we did a survey and one of the tick Mark
[360.04 - 366.08] top tick marks of the symptoms that
[362.68 - 370.24] people wanted to improve want to take a
[366.08 - 372.44] guesser no
[370.24 - 375.28] constipation sense so so bear with me
[372.44 - 377.88] okay the funny story is coming in so
[375.28 - 381.56] think about it everyone if you are
[377.88 - 384.00] jacked up backed up early morning and
[381.56 - 385.80] you walk into the office at 11:00 a.m.
[384.00 - 387.76] and your entire team is there and you
[385.80 - 390.80] have not offloaded you're going to
[387.76 - 394.04] offload on somebody right so the the
[390.80 - 397.40] whole point over here was when we did
[394.04 - 399.60] that there was like 67 of the 100 survey
[397.40 - 401.72] who said constipation was one of the top
[399.60 - 406.20] three and when we did the survey 6
[401.72 - 409.96] months later so the realization was that
[406.20 - 414.68] um the funny part is that sometimes
[409.96 - 418.16] people don't understand that um human
[414.68 - 421.68] emotions productivity are all linked to
[418.16 - 423.12] how you feel and uh there this there's a
[421.68 - 425.48] beautiful book that was recommended to
[423.12 - 427.76] me in another HR it's called dying uh
[425.48 - 429.88] dying for a paycheck uh you should read
[427.76 - 432.08] it if you're in planning HR in your
[429.88 - 434.00] organization and health benefits I want
[432.08 - 436.56] to read just one line from this it's got
[434.00 - 438.72] It's it's not funny but it's the context
[436.56 - 441.56] of where we taking this discussion so
[438.72 - 444.84] that we
[441.56 - 447.56] understand how we cannot have uh we can
[444.84 - 449.60] have more joyous bosses bosses with you
[447.56 - 453.56] know give you a better rating and and
[449.60 - 457.16] stuff like that so people compensate for
[453.56 - 459.48] the psychological depletion I repeat
[457.16 - 463.52] people compensate for psychological
[459.48 - 466.96] depletion of energy from a stressful
[463.52 - 469.84] work environment by
[466.96 - 473.48] Ting so when you have a boss who's
[469.84 - 475.68] backed up not taken a dump oh by the way
[473.48 - 477.76] this boss uh became very cheerful by
[475.68 - 479.88] 4:00 in the
[477.76 - 481.80] afternoon so you understand that there
[479.88 - 485.16] was a bowel M somewhere between 1 and
[481.80 - 486.68] 3:00 okay so yeah nutrition I mean
[485.16 - 489.40] nobody would discuss bowel movement
[486.68 - 492.48] except a nutritionist but the funny part
[489.40 - 496.96] over here is the rest of the team would
[492.48 - 500.04] ovat because they got yelling at 11: to
[496.96 - 502.64] 3:00 so they would order the from the
[500.04 - 505.68] e-commerce apps the most unhealthy stuff
[502.64 - 508.44] so while the boss is angry the team is
[505.68 - 510.72] sad the team is anxiety the team is
[508.44 - 513.68] demotivation and they also gaining
[510.72 - 515.76] weight and they you basically so it's
[513.68 - 519.24] very easy to say hey boss I need you to
[515.76 - 521.32] do a diet and employees are like they
[519.24 - 522.68] can be stressful to HR like oh you want
[521.32 - 524.68] to control my paycheck you want to
[522.68 - 525.60] control my K now you want to control my
[524.68 - 528.24] diet
[525.60 - 529.84] also so please understand that Wellness
[528.24 - 531.48] also comes from a perspective where
[529.84 - 532.60] employees think you're infringing on
[531.48 - 535.12] their
[532.60 - 537.00] privacy so it it goes both ways you have
[535.12 - 539.00] an angry boss but you could also have an
[537.00 - 540.48] angry employee for you needling in that
[539.00 - 543.48] so
[540.48 - 545.88] long story short I think a lot of a lot
[543.48 - 549.68] more people in that organization got
[545.88 - 551.68] happier because we moved coolers to the
[549.68 - 554.00] workplace because they were like at one
[551.68 - 556.80] end of the corridor on this 10,000 s ft
[554.00 - 559.84] so just had three coolers second is we
[556.80 - 561.28] got personalized water bottles done and
[559.84 - 562.88] then when we told them that they had to
[561.28 - 564.24] drink two of those bottles and they were
[562.88 - 566.32] like dude I'm not even drinking one
[564.24 - 569.48] bottle and because they were not
[566.32 - 571.36] drinking enough of water they were less
[569.48 - 572.96] water but do you know that AC's
[571.36 - 575.20] dehydrate
[572.96 - 577.40] employees so you dehydrate but where
[575.20 - 579.28] will you pull out the water from the
[577.40 - 580.60] food that is digesting in you contains
[579.28 - 583.00] water so when you're pulling out the
[580.60 - 586.56] water which goes out in your breath your
[583.00 - 589.12] poop is just going to get more stuck up
[586.56 - 591.32] right and hence an angry boss first
[589.12 - 594.80] thing in the morning so if you have that
[591.32 - 597.20] angry boss bring bananas to
[594.80 - 599.68] work when you go to meet your boss say
[597.20 - 601.52] boss would you like a glass of water
[599.68 - 604.48] okay so this is stuff that you could do
[601.52 - 607.20] it's a weird domino effect of
[604.48 - 609.20] not one lesson we take away from that is
[607.20 - 610.56] do as managers we shouldn't forget to
[609.20 - 613.16] offload in the morning so there's
[610.56 - 614.44] another part to this which is and I like
[613.16 - 616.60] to talk about nutrition on the
[614.44 - 617.96] constipation part the world thinks that
[616.60 - 619.88] everyone should dump first thing in the
[617.96 - 621.92] morning that's wrong there are different
[619.88 - 624.72] types of people on the planet there are
[621.92 - 626.44] any any part of the Poopers there is
[624.72 - 628.64] evening Poopers there's afternoon
[626.44 - 631.00] Poopers it's absolutely normal so if
[628.64 - 633.16] your parents made you feel guilty about
[631.00 - 635.12] not having an early morning dump rest
[633.16 - 637.12] ass short briyan Fernando says you can
[635.12 - 639.88] be that angry boss but just make sure
[637.12 - 643.08] you add more fiber and water in your
[639.88 - 645.64] diet all right switching away from that
[643.08 - 648.68] uh we'll talk
[645.64 - 651.52] more I can see he's
[648.68 - 653.60] uncomfortable regarding more designing
[651.52 - 655.40] Wellness programs for the organization
[653.60 - 658.52] because that's what we're here for I
[655.40 - 661.04] mean that was a good transition uh but
[658.52 - 662.72] see when you know as HR is the key you
[661.04 - 664.32] know stakeholders over here when they're
[662.72 - 666.04] designing a wellness program for an
[664.32 - 667.60] organization they need to keep a lot of
[666.04 - 670.72] things in their mind so it's not just
[667.60 - 672.32] you know uh as individual celebrity
[670.72 - 675.08] nutritionist you might be working you
[672.32 - 676.24] know at one one particular person at a
[675.08 - 678.72] time but you know when you're
[676.24 - 680.56] implementing an organization wide uh
[678.72 - 682.96] wellness program for example or a
[680.56 - 684.44] nutrition program you need to keep a lot
[682.96 - 686.48] of people you need to keep a certain
[684.44 - 688.32] scale in mind right so you need to have
[686.48 - 690.12] certain sort of template or framework
[688.32 - 692.44] that you can replicate on different you
[690.12 - 694.36] know individuals so how would you what
[692.44 - 696.48] suggestions would you give to the HR
[694.36 - 697.80] audience HR people in the audience over
[696.48 - 701.16] here
[697.80 - 703.92] so it's a tough task to get for HR to
[701.16 - 707.00] get people motivated in today's day and
[703.92 - 708.80] age um so just bear with me on this what
[707.00 - 710.64] I believe I've I've been sitting in a
[708.80 - 713.28] chair like this for about 15 years now
[710.64 - 715.40] as a nutritionist in forums where he
[713.28 - 718.48] talk to HR managers it has changed
[715.40 - 720.48] postco people are more ready to take
[718.48 - 723.60] care of their health so the starting
[720.48 - 725.40] point is that blood test that we do the
[723.60 - 727.44] mentioned right at the beginning there's
[725.40 - 729.16] a blood test when the guy comes in put a
[727.44 - 731.52] gun to his head are you worthy to enter
[729.16 - 733.52] my organization cholesterol tick liver
[731.52 - 735.64] profile tick kidney profile tick okay
[733.52 - 739.40] come into the company but after you come
[735.64 - 741.92] into the company the blood test is
[739.40 - 744.24] voluntary the word voluntary and I I'll
[741.92 - 746.48] share with you the secret here there are
[744.24 - 749.52] two types of people in the world there
[746.48 - 752.04] is the pain and the vein
[749.52 - 754.64] you've got to you've got to identify in
[752.04 - 757.20] your organization who are the pain not
[754.64 - 759.60] giving pain but people wait till they
[757.20 - 761.64] get diabetes hypertension sugar problem
[759.60 - 763.56] and then the way who want to behave like
[761.64 - 765.48] verat Koh or Anushka Sharma kind of
[763.56 - 768.24] thing that they will take care of
[765.48 - 770.44] themselves because that's how they think
[768.24 - 773.00] very easy to find such people the person
[770.44 - 774.92] whose desk is very clean in an office is
[773.00 - 777.28] a vanity
[774.92 - 779.20] person right that's a person who would
[777.28 - 781.44] do the oh this is my blood test what
[779.20 - 783.40] should I do now but a persons whose desk
[781.44 - 786.20] is completely cluttered and blah blah
[783.40 - 789.16] blah whatever they going to have to work
[786.20 - 791.24] at a different frequency their frequency
[789.16 - 793.24] is more and more
[791.24 - 795.64] awareness and so how do you build that
[793.24 - 798.44] awareness you build that awareness not
[795.64 - 801.44] by feeding them information in my
[798.44 - 803.36] opinion you just make them the celebrity
[801.44 - 806.36] of their
[803.36 - 809.68] life when people come out of college
[806.36 - 813.80] their self net worth is very low if you
[809.68 - 815.92] ask me you need as HR to raise that
[813.80 - 817.12] level that this person is a very
[815.92 - 820.48] valuable
[817.12 - 822.60] contributor and I I have one tagline
[820.48 - 825.56] which I use which is which I've asked to
[822.60 - 827.68] be put up over here you give this
[825.56 - 830.48] tagline to anyone and ask them to
[827.68 - 832.60] keychain it onto their desk or keep it
[830.48 - 834.60] and every time you see it my and you
[832.60 - 836.80] don't use the word ah you just say my
[834.60 - 839.92] body is the most expensive real
[836.80 - 841.96] estate after that I will ever your
[839.92 - 843.12] own you can change your car you can
[841.96 - 844.36] change your mobile you can change your
[843.12 - 846.56] laptop you can change your house you can
[844.36 - 848.16] change your job you can change your
[846.56 - 849.88] spouse you can't change your parents and
[848.16 - 851.20] you can't change your sibling okay bear
[849.88 - 854.44] with
[851.20 - 857.24] me what's my point over here your body
[854.44 - 860.40] is the most non-changeable asset so you
[857.24 - 863.40] got to make employees realize that that
[860.40 - 864.72] even you as a company and you as an HR
[863.40 - 867.60] are the
[864.72 - 870.28] transitionary vector to enabling this
[867.60 - 872.44] person to come to Greatness
[870.28 - 875.92] bear with me in the final
[872.44 - 877.40] Point AI is coming AI is going to go at
[875.92 - 879.68] the fifth level if you have read Sam
[877.40 - 883.00] alman's blog he writes the different
[879.68 - 886.00] five levels of AI the fifth level is
[883.00 - 888.52] organizational implementation of AI
[886.00 - 889.32] meaning AI will create organizations on
[888.52 - 891.48] its
[889.32 - 893.00] own who are going to be the most
[891.48 - 894.52] valuable assets
[893.00 - 897.64] then
[894.52 - 899.28] people so let's say you join a company
[897.64 - 902.32] and I'm an entrepreneur and I say please
[899.28 - 903.96] come join me you're going to be offering
[902.32 - 905.28] I'm giving you ergonomic chairs I'm
[903.96 - 906.72] giving you this I'm giving you blood
[905.28 - 908.64] tests I'm giving you that I'm giving you
[906.72 - 909.92] everything I'm giving you a salary
[908.64 - 914.76] you're just going to look through the
[909.92 - 918.48] employee and say what about me which is
[914.76 - 920.36] the most valuable real estate so if you
[918.48 - 924.48] can begin
[920.36 - 926.60] to Market that to your employee that you
[924.48 - 930.44] are the most valuable estate that you
[926.60 - 931.68] own we are not saying it you say it now
[930.44 - 933.92] what do you want to do and what do you
[931.68 - 936.60] want us to help you out with and
[933.92 - 938.04] obviously you have a budget right ask
[936.60 - 942.12] the person what they want to do with
[938.04 - 944.36] that budget and out of 100 people five
[942.12 - 947.48] will volunteer 95 will
[944.36 - 950.20] not but when you create a culture over a
[947.48 - 952.60] period of time and it'll take 10 15
[950.20 - 955.68] years to move an entire organization to
[952.60 - 959.68] healthier or as people move from 25 to
[955.68 - 962.48] 35 35 to 45 as they grow in the age
[959.68 - 963.92] category and the weight category they're
[962.48 - 967.28] going to figure it out that's what they
[963.92 - 968.92] want to do all right so basically when
[967.28 - 970.96] we're designing a wellness program a lot
[968.92 - 972.88] of times we keep this particular metric
[970.96 - 974.60] in mind or you know an impact in mind
[972.88 - 976.92] that maybe it should increase our
[974.60 - 978.96] productivity or my people's productivity
[976.92 - 981.64] in a lot of ways because you know you
[978.96 - 983.92] want to show a measurable or or an
[981.64 - 985.64] impact that you know you can probably
[983.92 - 988.08] brag about you know this was the impact
[985.64 - 989.72] that was created by my wellness program
[988.08 - 991.72] what do you suggest you know should be
[989.72 - 994.64] the key components of a wellness program
[991.72 - 998.16] if productivity is one of the major you
[994.64 - 998.16] know driving factors behind
[998.76 - 1002.80] it
[1000.48 - 1005.28] so there are a lot of metrics in this
[1002.80 - 1008.40] book which talk about Employee
[1005.28 - 1010.40] Engagement and employee productivity the
[1008.40 - 1011.96] first question is does an employee think
[1010.40 - 1014.48] that your measure of productivity is
[1011.96 - 1016.32] democratic enough for them so a lot of
[1014.48 - 1018.88] times people feel that the measurements
[1016.32 - 1021.00] are skewed from a wellness perspective
[1018.88 - 1023.52] perspective I'll give you I'll give you
[1021.00 - 1026.48] a simple perspective of an
[1023.52 - 1029.40] organization US
[1026.48 - 1030.56] prisons okay now please don't troll me
[1029.40 - 1033.64] on the internet tomorrow if you're
[1030.56 - 1036.80] loading this I'm not comparing uh the
[1033.64 - 1038.80] the the organization to us prison but
[1036.80 - 1041.72] there was extreme amount of violence
[1038.80 - 1043.48] anxiety and suicides in American prisons
[1041.72 - 1046.72] so they divided this prison block into
[1043.48 - 1048.64] two parts one block they brought in this
[1046.72 - 1051.44] organizational change which was changing
[1048.64 - 1054.48] the nutrition bringing breath work
[1051.44 - 1059.16] meditation they found something like a
[1054.48 - 1060.44] 60 plus% drop in gang wars suicides
[1059.16 - 1063.80] deaths in the
[1060.44 - 1065.72] prison so that's extreme human behavior
[1063.80 - 1067.80] somebody's
[1065.72 - 1070.64] incarcerated we have
[1067.80 - 1073.88] organizations it's not a prison but many
[1070.64 - 1075.28] employees feel oh yeah I'm working 9 to5
[1073.88 - 1077.88] I'm in a
[1075.28 - 1080.44] prison I would like to motivate people
[1077.88 - 1083.36] to say that if you have a job in today's
[1080.44 - 1086.52] day and age embrace it the universe is
[1083.36 - 1088.64] giving you a sense of purpose the moment
[1086.52 - 1090.96] you Embrace that sense of purpose your
[1088.64 - 1092.80] metrics in the wellness program is how
[1090.96 - 1096.96] can I improve my
[1092.80 - 1098.04] productivity very simple behave like an
[1096.96 - 1100.24] Olympic
[1098.04 - 1101.48] Athlete simple what does an Olympic
[1100.24 - 1104.00] Athlete do
[1101.48 - 1105.96] sir this is your fat percentage this is
[1104.00 - 1108.44] your muscle perent okay what is my
[1105.96 - 1110.32] viseral fat so much oh so much visal fat
[1108.44 - 1113.00] what should I start doing let me improve
[1110.32 - 1115.12] my visceral fat how has visceral fat got
[1113.00 - 1117.80] anything to do with productivity in the
[1115.12 - 1120.92] workplace
[1117.80 - 1123.16] everything if a person is taking statins
[1120.92 - 1126.44] because of cholesterol do you know that
[1123.16 - 1128.12] they are more tired because of statins
[1126.44 - 1130.40] how many 30 year olds do you know in
[1128.12 - 1133.56] your organization are taking
[1130.40 - 1135.12] statins and you meet my media team they
[1133.56 - 1139.80] are rock
[1135.12 - 1139.80] stars absolute rock stars
[1141.00 - 1147.64] why because they in that environment of
[1144.84 - 1150.72] constant so you need to find brand
[1147.64 - 1153.96] ambassadors or recruit people in their
[1150.72 - 1156.48] CVS who say they are in sports they're
[1153.96 - 1159.00] in Zumba they're in Pilatus they're in
[1156.48 - 1160.64] Gym training and Seed them in that part
[1159.00 - 1163.64] when you're recruiting it I've got a
[1160.64 - 1165.92] techy guy who goes to the gym I'm like
[1163.64 - 1167.92] dude where you no no no in the in the
[1165.92 - 1169.84] entire College out of 100 students I was
[1167.92 - 1173.92] the five of us to go to the gym I saw
[1169.84 - 1176.28] that in a CV I want you in my company so
[1173.92 - 1178.04] employee productivity definitely goes up
[1176.28 - 1181.24] with nutrition I'll give you a simple
[1178.04 - 1184.60] point there was a a study done on school
[1181.24 - 1187.80] children uh given I don't remember how
[1184.60 - 1190.36] many walnuts a day but the productivity
[1187.80 - 1194.20] in in math test scores went up by
[1190.36 - 1195.72] 11% now if you run a finance company
[1194.20 - 1198.44] wouldn't you want all your accountants
[1195.72 - 1200.48] to be eating walnuts right now the
[1198.44 - 1203.00] question question is does HR give the
[1200.48 - 1205.80] walnuts or does the employee buy the
[1203.00 - 1209.20] walnuts you need to figure out the
[1205.80 - 1211.72] motivational part and the awareness part
[1209.20 - 1214.80] leave the rest of the employee India is
[1211.72 - 1217.88] moving in that direction India is the
[1214.80 - 1221.44] largest population in the world with the
[1217.88 - 1224.84] youngest Workforce in the world but we
[1221.44 - 1227.00] will become this not we will we are the
[1224.84 - 1230.60] sickest population in the world Food For
[1227.00 - 1233.20] Thought HR has a seismic responsibility
[1230.60 - 1236.36] in preventing this young largest
[1233.20 - 1238.64] Workforce moving into the sick part and
[1236.36 - 1240.60] it doesn't start at the age of 45 plus
[1238.64 - 1242.60] when I'm vice president and getting all
[1240.60 - 1245.56] those spks and benefits it starts at
[1242.60 - 1247.80] that 25 to 35 year of age group and all
[1245.56 - 1249.16] of those guys say hey Ryan Fernando what
[1247.80 - 1251.12] do you want to do diet man let's go to
[1249.16 - 1254.28] Goan party your state anyway gives
[1251.12 - 1257.20] alcohol so cheap so you've got to begin
[1254.28 - 1259.68] to involve people in hiking trekking
[1257.20 - 1262.56] offs sites which are more Fitness
[1259.68 - 1265.32] incline change the awareness and
[1262.56 - 1268.64] cafeterias I've gone to cafeterias a
[1265.32 - 1272.56] simple thing like a tent card saying
[1268.64 - 1275.44] that this bowl is 100 G of rice is so
[1272.56 - 1278.76] many calories and is equivalent to 45
[1275.44 - 1281.48] minutes of walking we did this in an
[1278.76 - 1284.20] organization and the Katra actually said
[1281.48 - 1288.16] Sab rice
[1284.20 - 1290.52] consumption in 6 weeks simple awareness
[1288.16 - 1293.52] the metrics is just letting your
[1290.52 - 1295.96] employee get more and more and the
[1293.52 - 1297.52] enthusiasm of HR is always to kind of
[1295.96 - 1299.84] give a lot of information so now you
[1297.52 - 1301.96] have sleep information exercise
[1299.84 - 1304.20] information nutrition information
[1301.96 - 1306.44] psychological information doctor's
[1304.20 - 1308.56] information then the employee feels
[1306.44 - 1312.64] overwhelmed so you need to have a
[1308.56 - 1314.56] calendar that Paces that out you know so
[1312.64 - 1315.96] transitioning on the cafeteria topic I
[1314.56 - 1318.12] know a lot of people here might be
[1315.96 - 1320.16] responsible in designing cafeteria menus
[1318.12 - 1322.76] or you incorporating healthy eating
[1320.16 - 1324.32] options over there how do you uh suggest
[1322.76 - 1326.88] you know with the vegetarian
[1324.32 - 1329.40] nonvegetarian even vegan options coming
[1326.88 - 1331.36] in or the people preferring to be vegan
[1329.40 - 1333.84] at least the younger audience how do you
[1331.36 - 1335.44] sort of you know suggest them to be more
[1333.84 - 1337.44] inclusive when it comes to different
[1335.44 - 1340.04] food
[1337.44 - 1342.12] orientation um that's a that's a huge
[1340.04 - 1343.88] problem I ran a business called itifen
[1342.12 - 1345.80] where we provided healthy meals to
[1343.88 - 1348.16] people it it shut down because of this
[1345.80 - 1349.24] problem cuz the vegan comes in like why
[1348.16 - 1350.84] aren't you so serving vegan food
[1349.24 - 1352.44] vegetarian like I can't eat in that
[1350.84 - 1354.24] kitchen where non-v food is also
[1352.44 - 1355.92] prepared right so you have all of these
[1354.24 - 1358.24] problems and you will go through these
[1355.92 - 1360.16] problems when I run my company the
[1358.24 - 1363.68] simplest uh thought process as a
[1360.16 - 1366.48] nutritionist is this keep educating them
[1363.68 - 1369.36] on the basic premise which is what's the
[1366.48 - 1371.00] calorie I need per day what is the
[1369.36 - 1372.80] timing of the day that I'm eating that
[1371.00 - 1374.80] calorie then break down the protein
[1372.80 - 1376.96] carbs and fats and then tell them
[1374.80 - 1379.92] vegetarian non-v the mistake we make is
[1376.96 - 1381.60] first decide vegetarian Nonet in vegan
[1379.92 - 1384.00] and when you lead from that you're bound
[1381.60 - 1386.04] to trip up because you're telling the
[1384.00 - 1388.44] person I'm coming with cultural
[1386.04 - 1390.16] differentiation in the organization no
[1388.44 - 1391.88] you just say that hey this is the veg
[1390.16 - 1393.68] Buffet that's the non-v buffet these are
[1391.88 - 1398.12] the options available and here we got
[1393.68 - 1399.92] one vegan option over a period of time
[1398.12 - 1402.48] you will realize that 90% of the
[1399.92 - 1403.80] employees below below the age of 95 eat
[1402.48 - 1406.40] with taste
[1403.80 - 1409.04] buds they're not worried about their
[1406.40 - 1411.60] health but if you start that blood test
[1409.04 - 1412.72] so I work with this Japanese screening
[1411.60 - 1415.68] firm called
[1412.72 - 1417.44] nura and they had about 100 employees
[1415.68 - 1420.40] screen I can't take the name of the
[1417.44 - 1422.36] company and uh it's a Japanese company
[1420.40 - 1424.28] that got screen from Hyderabad and they
[1422.36 - 1425.32] screened everybody and they gave the
[1424.28 - 1429.00] visal
[1425.32 - 1432.84] fat the 100 employees next year came
[1429.00 - 1435.52] back again Cent percent all the 100
[1432.84 - 1436.92] employees knew what was visceral fat
[1435.52 - 1439.32] they knew in the previous year that
[1436.92 - 1442.76] their visceral fat was gun to my head
[1439.32 - 1445.64] above 100 square cm they said nobody had
[1442.76 - 1447.72] ever told us about this metrics they all
[1445.64 - 1448.60] volunt started changing their food and
[1447.72 - 1451.48] their
[1448.60 - 1453.96] exercise so when you're in the workplace
[1451.48 - 1457.92] you got to figure out what percentage of
[1453.96 - 1461.08] your population is in this direction am
[1457.92 - 1463.12] I ready to do this so if you have 80% of
[1461.08 - 1465.44] your population in Workforce wanting to
[1463.12 - 1470.36] be healthy get
[1465.44 - 1470.36] inclusive if 80% are like by Dal chavel
[1470.44 - 1474.40] don't go in that version go with the
[1472.68 - 1477.40] reverse which is the blood test which is
[1474.40 - 1479.72] the exercise test offsite maybe people
[1477.40 - 1483.16] are doing great stuff like how long can
[1479.72 - 1485.44] you dance for you know on one foot this
[1483.16 - 1488.20] fun stuff you got to make people realize
[1485.44 - 1490.96] over Milestones that they are healthy or
[1488.20 - 1493.64] unhealthy all right so yeah this is more
[1490.96 - 1496.24] on a personal or a that sort of a thing
[1493.64 - 1497.64] on a very specific question coffee what
[1496.24 - 1499.48] are your thoughts because a lot of
[1497.64 - 1501.60] people in especially in cooporate work
[1499.48 - 1503.28] spaces rely and run on coffee when they
[1501.60 - 1508.28] have to go from meetings to meetings or
[1503.28 - 1513.16] you know SL longer hours and I I think
[1508.28 - 1515.72] uh so coffee is good if you do the gene
[1513.16 - 1518.88] test which we do in our Clinic you have
[1515.72 - 1521.04] coffee positive receptor people and po
[1518.88 - 1523.12] coffee negative receptor people so I'm a
[1521.04 - 1525.32] negative receptor so maximum I can do
[1523.12 - 1527.40] two cups of coffee a day anything more
[1525.32 - 1528.96] than that activates my blood pressure
[1527.40 - 1530.28] and stroke risk
[1528.96 - 1532.12] there are people who are positive
[1530.28 - 1534.76] receptors who can drink six seven cups
[1532.12 - 1538.00] of coffee a day now here's the issue
[1534.76 - 1541.32] number one caffeine is known to boost
[1538.00 - 1544.76] mental alertness are you not mentally
[1541.32 - 1546.64] alert because your diet is bad you have
[1544.76 - 1549.04] diabetes hypertension cholesterol in the
[1546.64 - 1551.52] background you didn't eat a nutritious
[1549.04 - 1554.04] breakfast a simple thing I will tell you
[1551.52 - 1555.92] is um I had a film star sister called me
[1554.04 - 1557.92] up yesterday she says I've got a thank
[1555.92 - 1559.96] you you did this test that test I have
[1557.92 - 1562.60] stopped craving sugar for the first time
[1559.96 - 1564.00] in 25 years of my life what magic have
[1562.60 - 1566.56] you done I said nothing we just did your
[1564.00 - 1568.88] testing you are XYZ deficiency you had
[1566.56 - 1571.40] too much of this bacteria in your gut
[1568.88 - 1575.56] you're not supposed to eat rice it's
[1571.40 - 1577.92] like huh but but but I said no buts this
[1575.56 - 1580.32] is your blueprint so the coffee
[1577.92 - 1583.48] blueprint is very simple we are
[1580.32 - 1586.72] consuming more tea and coffee because
[1583.48 - 1589.28] India is eating less
[1586.72 - 1592.84] nutritiously India is coming to the
[1589.28 - 1595.68] Metros and is away from mama papa and D
[1592.84 - 1597.32] daddy Nana Nani who would prepare tiffen
[1595.68 - 1599.04] box and give it to you so those of you
[1597.32 - 1600.24] who live with your parents you are still
[1599.04 - 1602.72] very
[1600.24 - 1605.64] lucky because you will carry a tiffen
[1602.72 - 1608.36] box which is prepared with love the
[1605.64 - 1610.40] logistics of buying that food is of the
[1608.36 - 1612.80] highest quality as compared to a
[1610.40 - 1614.52] restaurant delivering the food or even
[1612.80 - 1615.84] that caterer God forbid you may throw
[1614.52 - 1617.52] something at me because you have a
[1615.84 - 1619.60] caterer in your organization cuz he's
[1617.52 - 1621.72] cutting corners unless you're very
[1619.60 - 1623.96] astute to say boss you will cook the
[1621.72 - 1625.64] food but my purchase manager will Source
[1623.96 - 1628.00] it and if your purchase manager is
[1625.64 - 1629.96] eating that food they will buy the best
[1628.00 - 1632.36] possible rice not the worst possible
[1629.96 - 1635.68] rice so what I'm trying to communicate
[1632.36 - 1637.56] we're drinking more energy beverages
[1635.68 - 1640.40] because we are feeling DEA in the
[1637.56 - 1642.64] workplace we're feeling DEA because you
[1640.40 - 1646.48] have not eaten correctly in engineering
[1642.64 - 1648.64] and MBA or medicine or Finance then we
[1646.48 - 1651.44] come into the workplace we want to work
[1648.64 - 1655.20] our asses off to prove to society that
[1651.44 - 1656.60] we can perform in that process I'm
[1655.20 - 1658.80] ignoring my
[1656.60 - 1661.24] nutrition and because I'm ignoring my
[1658.80 - 1663.56] nutrition I'm getting these Cravings all
[1661.24 - 1666.00] the time yeah one Fox's sweet over here
[1663.56 - 1668.92] is very easy Temptation 19 calories
[1666.00 - 1671.84] right now 19 calories may not seem much
[1668.92 - 1674.40] but is one Fox's mint gone into your
[1671.84 - 1675.84] mouth or 16 went into your mouth today
[1674.40 - 1680.08] there's something called the snacking
[1675.84 - 1683.76] Gene so what people need to do in 2024
[1680.08 - 1686.96] onwards begin to discover which food is
[1683.76 - 1689.76] thumbs up and which food is thumbs down
[1686.96 - 1691.92] you start with this you don't need HR
[1689.76 - 1694.56] you need HR to say that boss you are an
[1691.92 - 1697.44] amazing employee get moving so I think
[1694.56 - 1699.04] this is a nice blend wherein today HR
[1697.44 - 1701.28] needs to be very
[1699.04 - 1702.92] motivational and that motivation is
[1701.28 - 1705.72] what's going to get people there and
[1702.92 - 1705.72] when you talked about
[1705.84 - 1710.52] scalability you have brand ambassadors
[1708.16 - 1713.04] is in your own organization who are
[1710.52 - 1715.44] heroes you bring them on
[1713.04 - 1716.48] board and the moment that happens so I
[1715.44 - 1718.24] I'll give you an example in my
[1716.48 - 1721.32] organization I started breath work for
[1718.24 - 1723.28] my media team and during the pandemic I
[1721.32 - 1726.16] gave personal trainers to each and every
[1723.28 - 1728.16] one of my dieticians out of 50 or 60
[1726.16 - 1730.84] only two took it up so I thought maybe
[1728.16 - 1732.24] my employees don't want it now I did
[1730.84 - 1733.96] breath work for one team I didn't give
[1732.24 - 1736.08] it to the entire company the rest of the
[1733.96 - 1739.76] company is like where's my breath work I
[1736.08 - 1742.08] also want it right so we all like that
[1739.76 - 1743.96] when we are not given something we want
[1742.08 - 1746.32] it so maybe as HR you need to be a
[1743.96 - 1748.32] little bit what's the
[1746.32 - 1750.84] word
[1748.32 - 1752.52] crafty because the end goal is what you
[1750.84 - 1754.00] want them to come and ask you for that
[1752.52 - 1756.16] because the moment they ask you for it
[1754.00 - 1758.44] the compliance is even better
[1756.16 - 1760.04] interesting part so a lot of companies
[1758.44 - 1762.08] also end up running these step
[1760.04 - 1763.48] challenges or you know step counter
[1762.08 - 1766.12] challenges wherein you know they set
[1763.48 - 1768.64] targets that whoever you know tracks the
[1766.12 - 1770.12] most number of steps wins like maybe or
[1768.64 - 1772.16] they have very interesting Awards and
[1770.12 - 1774.84] things like that so that you know ends
[1772.16 - 1777.48] up making people just walk a number of
[1774.84 - 1779.52] steps or just do this all shake their
[1777.48 - 1781.20] phon shake their oh yeah I had a guy I
[1779.52 - 1784.60] had a guy who tied the phone to his dog
[1781.20 - 1787.84] and got more St done tie the phone to
[1784.60 - 1789.32] thean very so your question is is it
[1787.84 - 1790.72] good bad or ugly yeah what are your
[1789.32 - 1792.28] thoughts about it like step challenges
[1790.72 - 1794.16] are they the best way to go and how can
[1792.28 - 1796.24] you make it more holistic because that's
[1794.16 - 1799.00] only incorporating physical fitness
[1796.24 - 1802.32] right it's not incorporating other
[1799.00 - 1804.56] I think it's very easy to criticize any
[1802.32 - 1807.28] initiative what you need to do is like
[1804.56 - 1809.08] any business if you start a new Venture
[1807.28 - 1811.16] you say I want to start this and you
[1809.08 - 1813.08] want to see where it goes now as a
[1811.16 - 1815.68] nutritionist when I look at that I tell
[1813.08 - 1818.52] people walking is the best fat burning
[1815.68 - 1822.60] exercise we are all DJs you and I are
[1818.52 - 1824.48] DJs desk jockeys we sit at a desk right
[1822.60 - 1826.28] so we have no movement for eight or nine
[1824.48 - 1828.48] hours do you know that the the latest
[1826.28 - 1830.48] killer is actually sitting down
[1828.48 - 1833.16] so I think if organizations do step
[1830.48 - 1835.16] walking it's a great way to encourage
[1833.16 - 1837.80] people because we are
[1835.16 - 1840.28] sedentary uh what you do to encourage
[1837.80 - 1843.32] people to walk could be your kitty of
[1840.28 - 1845.12] gifts that you could give people one
[1843.32 - 1847.84] thought process and I'm so I'm basically
[1845.12 - 1849.20] Pro doing this in an organization it's
[1847.84 - 1850.84] very easy to do it's very easy to
[1849.20 - 1852.40] motivate people in fact on 2nd of
[1850.84 - 1855.80] October I'm launching something called
[1852.40 - 1858.24] the Gandhi Janti walk 4,000 steps a day
[1855.80 - 1860.72] and and the idea is because because we
[1858.24 - 1862.72] are the sickest population of lifestyle
[1860.72 - 1866.08] diseases what is lifestyle diseases
[1862.72 - 1868.16] diabetes hypertension uh fatty liver all
[1866.08 - 1870.48] come because of sedentary too much of
[1868.16 - 1872.96] eating no movement no calorie burn
[1870.48 - 1876.52] walking is amazing the issue with
[1872.96 - 1881.60] walking or Walker THS is the moment the
[1876.52 - 1881.60] general J stops doing it for 10 or 15
[1882.52 - 1886.96] days so there'll be that Elite guys who
[1885.68 - 1888.68] like yeah they're walking walking
[1886.96 - 1890.36] walking they gone ahead now you have all
[1888.68 - 1893.96] of these lagard
[1890.36 - 1895.92] say let's let's drop off so I think I
[1893.96 - 1898.36] would invite solutions from people out
[1895.92 - 1900.68] here how could you make it engaging such
[1898.36 - 1902.44] that every day people are sticking to
[1900.68 - 1904.28] that walking so then you'll have people
[1902.44 - 1906.84] you know taking a sales call or an HR
[1904.28 - 1909.96] call just walking and talking but trust
[1906.84 - 1911.52] me Amir Khan when he said how can I lose
[1909.96 - 1913.92] this much of weight for my roll and
[1911.52 - 1918.08] dungle I was like you need to walk
[1913.92 - 1919.84] 38,000 steps a day
[1918.08 - 1922.88] none of us can walk 38,000 steps that's
[1919.84 - 1925.28] almost 38 kilomet how can you do it
[1922.88 - 1928.84] right but he had a role to do it we are
[1925.28 - 1930.76] asking people do 4 to 6,000 steps a day
[1928.84 - 1931.96] weight maintainance is 10,000 steps
[1930.76 - 1934.92] those of you want to lose weight is
[1931.96 - 1937.68] above 10,000 steps a day so a lot of
[1934.92 - 1940.28] women especially do exercise for 1 hour
[1937.68 - 1942.28] like oh but I worked for 1 hour but 1
[1940.28 - 1944.56] hour is only 4 to 5,000 steps which is
[1942.28 - 1947.56] not enough for fat loss or weight loss
[1944.56 - 1950.00] and and evolution is unfair to women
[1947.56 - 1953.60] because because it's made women store
[1950.00 - 1955.52] fat for child birthing so unfortunately
[1953.60 - 1959.64] when you are in the workplace you don't
[1955.52 - 1962.48] have enough of movement and so stons are
[1959.64 - 1964.48] even better for a sizable woman
[1962.48 - 1967.00] population but then the psychological
[1964.48 - 1968.44] thing is I don't have time to do it so
[1967.00 - 1970.40] then you need a psychologist here on
[1968.44 - 1972.68] this discussion for him like how do we
[1970.40 - 1975.24] let people understand that they're
[1972.68 - 1977.36] responsible for their health okay makes
[1975.24 - 1978.80] sense but uh Wellness isn't something
[1977.36 - 1980.36] that people aren't doing right like
[1978.80 - 1982.68] everyone's incorporating Wellness in
[1980.36 - 1985.40] their own ways these days we see people
[1982.68 - 1988.24] I mean being wellness company ourselves
[1985.40 - 1989.76] we promote Wellness too much but
[1988.24 - 1991.92] nowadays we're seeing people who are
[1989.76 - 1994.44] going over into this whole thing we see
[1991.92 - 1996.04] people who know suddenly they start over
[1994.44 - 1999.04] exercising when they've not been
[1996.04 - 2000.56] exercising all their lives recently I I
[1999.04 - 2002.60] recently came across someone who was you
[2000.56 - 2004.12] know above 65 and then they suddenly
[2002.60 - 2007.40] thought that they could finish an Iron
[2004.12 - 2008.36] Man thing and then you know they didn't
[2007.40 - 2011.92] they had
[2008.36 - 2014.52] major after that but how do you sort of
[2011.92 - 2016.44] uh address these situations then there
[2014.52 - 2018.20] are people who end up you know taking
[2016.44 - 2020.00] unchecked they end up taking unchecked
[2018.20 - 2022.08] supplements as well because you know
[2020.00 - 2023.52] they read content around it or someone
[2022.08 - 2026.80] or they watch Ryan Fernando and they
[2023.52 - 2028.96] took took a supplement on the video yeah
[2026.80 - 2030.68] I mean you know or any other source Ryan
[2028.96 - 2032.20] Fernando is still very credible Source
[2030.68 - 2034.76] but you know some someone must have just
[2032.20 - 2036.76] suggested oh this Omega 3 or something
[2034.76 - 2038.56] like this does this this this but but is
[2036.76 - 2041.68] that right for me
[2038.56 - 2043.96] and yeah just something around these so
[2041.68 - 2045.92] the first part is everyone believes
[2043.96 - 2048.28] they're James Bond when they go to a gym
[2045.92 - 2049.72] right right and obviously even I when I
[2048.28 - 2052.32] go to the gym I see all of these guys
[2049.72 - 2054.56] working out and I still think I'm 19
[2052.32 - 2059.28] years old of age and I can deadlift more
[2054.56 - 2063.52] and the first part is I think um for
[2059.28 - 2066.48] people in corporate India is your if
[2063.52 - 2069.24] you're a white colored worker get a
[2066.48 - 2071.64] trainer get get a nutritionist if you're
[2069.24 - 2074.16] a blue colored worker uh you're
[2071.64 - 2076.52] invariably not going to afford a trainer
[2074.16 - 2078.44] or a nutritionist so then there's enough
[2076.52 - 2082.16] of content on the internet that directs
[2078.44 - 2085.36] you how to work out uh people need to
[2082.16 - 2087.08] know this it takes about 2 weeks to 6
[2085.36 - 2090.04] weeks to develop
[2087.08 - 2092.24] cardiovascular acclimatization meaning
[2090.04 - 2093.72] you can't suddenly start running it will
[2092.24 - 2096.64] take you 2 to 6 weeks for your heart to
[2093.72 - 2098.28] say huh by you're ready so you have to
[2096.64 - 2102.56] go for 2 to 6 weeks
[2098.28 - 2105.04] it takes your muscles about 3 months 90
[2102.56 - 2108.12] days to start feeling that non
[2105.04 - 2111.76] swess it takes your ligaments and
[2108.12 - 2114.72] cartilage and Joints about 270 days so a
[2111.76 - 2117.16] lot of people overdo those pull-ups
[2114.72 - 2119.48] overdo that walking and then the knee is
[2117.16 - 2122.68] not yet ready the muscle is ready but
[2119.48 - 2125.76] the joint may not be ready so anybody
[2122.68 - 2128.20] starting a fitness program is starting
[2125.76 - 2131.32] point is you're in beginner program for
[2128.20 - 2134.80] the first year all you have to do is
[2131.32 - 2137.80] turn up every day even if you work out
[2134.80 - 2140.20] for 10 minutes it's a success give one
[2137.80 - 2142.12] day in a week as a rest just turn up so
[2140.20 - 2144.04] I'll go to the gym I'll just turn up
[2142.12 - 2146.36] like today I missed my workout so I'm
[2144.04 - 2148.96] going to go back home uh I'll do some
[2146.36 - 2151.76] push-ups I'll just turn up I'll do some
[2148.96 - 2154.96] breathing I'll do some Nam Sy stem what
[2151.76 - 2159.08] I'll turn up so people just turn up over
[2154.96 - 2161.80] a year the body gets ready uh and what
[2159.08 - 2164.80] HR organizations can do is create more
[2161.80 - 2167.20] awareness about these shorter
[2164.80 - 2168.68] workouts uh you get shorter formats of
[2167.20 - 2171.00] workouts which people can do which are
[2168.68 - 2173.08] not a strain on the cardiovascular
[2171.00 - 2176.00] system skeletal system or the muscle
[2173.08 - 2178.56] system but then I'll tell you why people
[2176.00 - 2181.36] strain because their number one goal is
[2178.56 - 2182.80] weight loss um I had the privilege of
[2181.36 - 2184.36] sitting in a meeting with some of the
[2182.80 - 2186.68] leading Founders in the country in
[2184.36 - 2189.28] healthcare businesses and most of their
[2186.68 - 2190.80] Healthcare diet plans came from weight
[2189.28 - 2193.44] loss over
[2190.80 - 2196.28] 68% so if you're looking at Weight Loss
[2193.44 - 2198.80] what is your common thought fastest way
[2196.28 - 2198.80] to lose
[2200.96 - 2205.96] weight that logic has to be tempered
[2203.56 - 2208.28] with greater awareness greater resources
[2205.96 - 2210.32] being offered great greater seminars and
[2208.28 - 2212.28] stuff like that with regards to the
[2210.32 - 2213.96] self-prescription
[2212.28 - 2217.80] that's the
[2213.96 - 2221.92] worst I had a story once where uh this
[2217.80 - 2225.36] lady came into the clinic um and um she
[2221.92 - 2230.24] was U diagnosed with liver
[2225.36 - 2233.76] cancer um young lady 34 35 liver cancer
[2230.24 - 2237.36] why she was taking ayurvedic fat burner
[2233.76 - 2239.92] to lose weight now I don't know if I'm I
[2237.36 - 2242.28] don't know where she bought what from
[2239.92 - 2244.48] but the English medicine doctor
[2242.28 - 2247.04] absolutely shot down our ancient
[2244.48 - 2249.56] tradition system it's not the fault of
[2247.04 - 2252.32] the ancient traditional system of ayura
[2249.56 - 2253.84] the fault is a spurious manufacturer
[2252.32 - 2256.40] creating something which had heavy
[2253.84 - 2258.12] metals in it and those heavy metals
[2256.40 - 2261.24] turned up and destroyed her liver and
[2258.12 - 2262.64] her hemoglobin good news is she survived
[2261.24 - 2265.20] good news is she doesn't take any
[2262.64 - 2268.40] nutritional supplements bad news was
[2265.20 - 2270.56] that she decided to watch stuff or check
[2268.40 - 2272.52] with her auntie neighbor or check with
[2270.56 - 2275.76] her office colleague or check with Ryan
[2272.52 - 2278.52] Fernando on a free advice on YouTube
[2275.76 - 2281.28] suppl
[2278.52 - 2282.84] but supplements are a nutritional
[2281.28 - 2285.72] convenience for your nutritional
[2282.84 - 2288.52] indiscipline so I tell people get
[2285.72 - 2291.32] exercise discipline get sleep discipline
[2288.52 - 2293.68] get diet discipline then take a
[2291.32 - 2296.24] supplement supplement surgery is like
[2293.68 - 2300.72] you know what I was just coming now
[2296.24 - 2302.88] there was a Zen next to me maruti Zen so
[2300.72 - 2305.68] it's a nice classic now right he's got a
[2302.88 - 2308.84] Ferrari sticker on it does that make it
[2305.68 - 2308.84] a Ferrari
[2309.80 - 2314.32] so that's the exact thing Ferrari
[2312.08 - 2315.92] sticker for me is
[2314.32 - 2320.24] by
[2315.92 - 2322.72] ex protein Po got it so because some
[2320.24 - 2325.00] sports star is taking protein powder I
[2322.72 - 2328.56] am going to take protein powder without
[2325.00 - 2331.96] doing the hard work to become a Ferrari
[2328.56 - 2333.84] so that zenar represents at that point
[2331.96 - 2336.08] that yes he has an aspirational value to
[2333.84 - 2338.88] be Ferrari but when you do that with
[2336.08 - 2341.88] supplements you causing damage to the
[2338.88 - 2344.12] internal mechanism in you interesting
[2341.88 - 2346.96] I'm not saying supplements are bad I
[2344.12 - 2349.24] prescribe supplements I'm Pro supplement
[2346.96 - 2350.96] but when you kind of do it's like in
[2349.24 - 2352.16] your own organization people writing
[2350.96 - 2355.00] their own paycheck and think they're
[2352.16 - 2356.80] better than uh HR guys like the other
[2355.00 - 2358.64] day one one of my HR lady came to me she
[2356.80 - 2361.64] was very angry says sir why are you
[2358.64 - 2363.80] giving offer letter I I was like sorry
[2361.64 - 2365.48] ma'am I am there now fully HR team is
[2363.80 - 2367.80] there why are you writing offer letter
[2365.48 - 2370.92] same thing you go to the expert they
[2367.80 - 2372.68] will craft a beautiful letter which is
[2370.92 - 2374.80] proper for the employee proper for the
[2372.68 - 2377.12] company and the founder but I was being
[2374.80 - 2378.96] like a self prescription I will write HR
[2377.12 - 2381.08] offer letter so these are the things
[2378.96 - 2382.48] that we need to not do rely on Experts
[2381.08 - 2385.24] and I think this comes in India from
[2382.48 - 2388.60] this jugar thing saving money we all
[2385.24 - 2391.40] want to save money for what your body is
[2388.60 - 2394.52] the most expensive real estate spend on
[2391.40 - 2396.24] it are you uh more of a carrot or a
[2394.52 - 2398.24] stick guy I'm asking this because you
[2396.24 - 2400.84] know when you're desig a Intervention
[2398.24 - 2402.48] Program you end up using either of
[2400.84 - 2404.32] either one of those approaches either
[2402.48 - 2406.44] you end up incentivizing a lot or you
[2404.32 - 2409.04] end up penalizing a lot so what would be
[2406.44 - 2411.52] your take on
[2409.04 - 2413.44] this there's there's no easy way to
[2411.52 - 2415.68] answer this and all of you are HR heads
[2413.44 - 2419.20] over here would would be there at some
[2415.68 - 2421.84] point if your organization is fluff and
[2419.20 - 2424.12] clouds and lovey doy then use the carrot
[2421.84 - 2426.12] model if your organization is a
[2424.12 - 2428.20] go-getter organization you normally use
[2426.12 - 2431.20] the kind of there is a reward but
[2428.20 - 2434.48] there's also a stick model the greatest
[2431.20 - 2437.40] NBA basketball coaches are the coaches
[2434.48 - 2440.52] who kicked their players I'm not saying
[2437.40 - 2443.24] that HR has to kick people but I'm going
[2440.52 - 2449.44] with this fact that in
[2443.24 - 2451.40] Wellness the HR has to offer the carrot
[2449.44 - 2454.40] model the
[2451.40 - 2457.80] experts sleep coach psychologist
[2454.40 - 2461.48] nutritionist trainer has to take the L
[2457.80 - 2464.32] and beat the employee not figuratively
[2461.48 - 2466.16] but I've got to tell you you are 15 kgs
[2464.32 - 2468.48] overweight what the hell are you doing
[2466.16 - 2469.76] your cholesterol is 50 basis points out
[2468.48 - 2471.64] in the next 10 years you're going to be
[2469.76 - 2473.88] taking statins if you take
[2471.64 - 2476.68] statins flag hoisting is not going to
[2473.88 - 2481.08] happen at home if you get my
[2476.68 - 2483.64] drift so I have to do the stick but HR
[2481.08 - 2487.56] has to do the carrot and I
[2483.64 - 2489.36] think sometimes we too afraid and and I
[2487.56 - 2490.84] can understand your perspective I
[2489.36 - 2492.80] remember in this one incident I was
[2490.84 - 2494.60] discussing it with the team outside we
[2492.80 - 2496.80] went to this organization and we're like
[2494.60 - 2500.08] sir you're missing your 5:00 appointment
[2496.80 - 2502.60] the guy comes in put you guys control
[2500.08 - 2504.04] everything in my life my target my sales
[2502.60 - 2507.48] my everything now you're also
[2504.04 - 2510.84] controlling my diet like oh who is
[2507.48 - 2514.00] this guy and he was head of
[2510.84 - 2517.32] sales and he was like 120
[2514.00 - 2519.04] kgs now I can't use the stick model on a
[2517.32 - 2522.96] guy like this first of all he was double
[2519.04 - 2524.64] my size so in such a thing what we did
[2522.96 - 2525.36] and I'll tell you exactly what we did is
[2524.64 - 2527.84] we
[2525.36 - 2528.72] apologized and then I wrote him a letter
[2527.84 - 2533.40] as the
[2528.72 - 2535.60] expert about so she was like irritated
[2533.40 - 2535.60] like
[2538.32 - 2543.56] sir so I like no sir how old is your son
[2541.28 - 2546.68] or daughter I have a son he's 10 years
[2543.56 - 2548.60] old so I immediately Cal said sir sales
[2546.68 - 2550.44] call whenever you want to reach out this
[2548.60 - 2552.76] is our number here we
[2550.44 - 2555.32] here so I wrote him a nice letter the
[2552.76 - 2558.40] next day saying that I looked at his
[2555.32 - 2561.04] blood test and I found out that his
[2558.40 - 2563.84] blood markers were not good and I would
[2561.04 - 2568.08] like to be present for his son's wedding
[2563.84 - 2571.16] along with him but I predict that he
[2568.08 - 2573.16] might I predict that his son might have
[2571.16 - 2575.00] to be in the hospital with him because
[2573.16 - 2577.96] he could have a higher risk of heart
[2575.00 - 2580.88] attack BP or cancer
[2577.96 - 2583.92] next week Friday 5:00 he was there in
[2580.88 - 2586.76] the room dror sa sorry I'm not a doctor
[2583.92 - 2589.72] I'm nutrition n dror
[2586.76 - 2593.64] sa one side was the stick which was the
[2589.72 - 2595.88] expert but the HR say did everything
[2593.64 - 2597.20] possible to make him understand that
[2595.88 - 2599.00] look you know what if you don't want
[2597.20 - 2600.68] this thing we we'll take it away you'll
[2599.00 - 2603.00] give we'll give you an all all expense
[2600.68 - 2606.24] paid vacation instead of a diet plan
[2603.00 - 2608.00] with a nutritionist so there is no right
[2606.24 - 2611.28] and wrong rule the the problem we are
[2608.00 - 2613.24] having today is the scalability problem
[2611.28 - 2616.28] the scalability problem is the biggest
[2613.24 - 2618.60] problem because every employee expects
[2616.28 - 2620.96] personalization and if technology can
[2618.60 - 2623.32] give you personalization I think we'll
[2620.96 - 2625.68] win the battle with carrot rather than
[2623.32 - 2628.28] stick that's a very good thought to you
[2625.68 - 2631.44] know Le on considering we the on who
[2628.28 - 2634.24] like okay personaliz programs like that
[2631.44 - 2637.44] but uh so recently you know there's been
[2634.24 - 2640.08] a lot of talk about stress at workpl but
[2637.44 - 2642.28] you know uh now with companies taking up
[2640.08 - 2644.12] actions against or preventive actions to
[2642.28 - 2646.64] avoid it there could be you know
[2644.12 - 2648.28] thoughts of you know employees thinking
[2646.64 - 2650.08] that okay company is doing it for their
[2648.28 - 2652.16] benefit they're not actually concerned
[2650.08 - 2653.64] about me reducing my stress they're just
[2652.16 - 2655.68] concerned that you know okay I don't do
[2653.64 - 2657.84] something on of stress so they look bad
[2655.68 - 2660.76] how would you sort of you know address
[2657.84 - 2662.40] this topic of uh stress at workplace and
[2660.76 - 2667.48] you know from your background how would
[2662.40 - 2667.48] you provide Solutions around it
[2667.92 - 2675.88] uh myour Highway they collected 9 Crowes
[2671.72 - 2677.60] of fine uh with automatic AI cameras
[2675.88 - 2682.36] right people over speeding or not
[2677.60 - 2682.36] wearing seat belts the question is
[2682.92 - 2688.88] boss tax or you don't allow me to drive
[2686.60 - 2690.52] my car fast you don't allow me to you I
[2688.88 - 2693.20] should decide no what seat Bel I want to
[2690.52 - 2697.36] wear but there is an overall consensus
[2693.20 - 2700.40] on what we call as societal Norm for
[2697.36 - 2701.80] protection of society so we know that
[2700.40 - 2704.52] debts happen because I'm not wearing
[2701.80 - 2707.52] seat belt but people want to fight back
[2704.52 - 2710.44] so yes it is an employees god-given
[2707.52 - 2713.40] right to feel that keep by my employers
[2710.44 - 2715.20] against me and really looking out for me
[2713.40 - 2717.88] I have been an
[2715.20 - 2719.56] employee and 12 years ago I became an
[2717.88 - 2720.64] employer so I've been on both sides of
[2719.56 - 2722.96] the
[2720.64 - 2724.48] coin yes as an entrepreneur I have
[2722.96 - 2726.96] limited amount of money to take care of
[2724.48 - 2729.00] the employees sometimes and as an EMP
[2726.96 - 2730.76] employee I was demanding that I want a
[2729.00 - 2733.04] gym membership I want all of this and my
[2730.76 - 2736.08] boss at that time didn't give it to
[2733.04 - 2739.12] me part
[2736.08 - 2741.20] one you are responsible for your destiny
[2739.12 - 2743.84] as an individual
[2741.20 - 2745.56] first getting up at 5:00 in the morning
[2743.84 - 2748.40] and doing meditation your company is not
[2745.56 - 2749.92] going to do it for you packing a healthy
[2748.40 - 2752.96] tiffen box your company is not going to
[2749.92 - 2755.32] do it for you doing box breathing four
[2752.96 - 2758.28] breaths in four breaths hold four
[2755.32 - 2760.20] breaths out four breaths release is
[2758.28 - 2763.36] something you can do after every meeting
[2760.20 - 2764.80] or telephone call which lowers your BP
[2763.36 - 2766.92] heart rate and connects your
[2764.80 - 2769.08] parasympathetic nervous system this
[2766.92 - 2770.72] information is there compliance doesn't
[2769.08 - 2773.32] happen but when an organization asks you
[2770.72 - 2776.52] to do it boss bad
[2773.32 - 2780.08] cop HR is only for picnic and bad cop
[2776.52 - 2781.88] I've seen it my HR is like chewed up I'm
[2780.08 - 2785.16] like boss these guys are trying to take
[2781.88 - 2786.84] care of you no don't that's human nature
[2785.16 - 2788.32] you got to figure it out how it's going
[2786.84 - 2791.32] to going to work so I think at an
[2788.32 - 2795.08] organizational level the anxiety and
[2791.32 - 2798.20] mental anguish and this is
[2795.08 - 2801.56] controversial doesn't start in the
[2798.20 - 2804.72] workplace starts in your
[2801.56 - 2807.00] diet I will show you enough of
[2804.72 - 2809.20] research I will show you enough of
[2807.00 - 2811.20] people and mark my words I will sit in
[2809.20 - 2814.04] an audience like this 10 years later we
[2811.20 - 2816.88] will pull up this video where research
[2814.04 - 2819.24] will be saying this employee is having
[2816.88 - 2822.36] having mental issues please go and get a
[2819.24 - 2826.36] poop stool analysis I keep coming back
[2822.36 - 2829.52] to poop the gut microbiome you have more
[2826.36 - 2833.16] bacteria in your gut than your human
[2829.52 - 2836.36] cells and the gut eat the food first and
[2833.16 - 2840.32] dump the molecule back into you called
[2836.36 - 2842.64] the micro uh uh what micro ballone or
[2840.32 - 2844.68] something it's called b b b basically
[2842.64 - 2846.36] it's the the bacteria pooping back in
[2844.68 - 2848.76] you now that absorbs into your
[2846.36 - 2850.00] bloodstream and if it's a good bacteria
[2848.76 - 2852.96] you're feeling
[2850.00 - 2854.68] good if it's a bad bacteria you're
[2852.96 - 2859.32] bashing your boss's face
[2854.68 - 2861.60] in right so anxiety is starting because
[2859.32 - 2864.76] of nutritional
[2861.60 - 2866.68] incompetence nutritional unawareness
[2864.76 - 2869.04] I'll give you an example all of you in
[2866.68 - 2872.72] this room show me your blood test have
[2869.04 - 2875.08] you done a magnesium have you done a
[2872.72 - 2876.84] hemoglobin have you done a fertin have
[2875.08 - 2879.52] you done an iron have you done a
[2876.84 - 2882.84] magnesium blood test if any one of these
[2879.52 - 2886.32] are low you will always begin to feel
[2882.84 - 2889.32] anxious or have cravings you change that
[2886.32 - 2893.16] and suddenly you feel
[2889.32 - 2898.68] like a 100 m athlete so this is the
[2893.16 - 2902.40] first part your brain is made up of 60%
[2898.68 - 2904.56] fat 50% of this fat is made up of
[2902.40 - 2907.64] omega3 what are we using in our
[2904.56 - 2909.16] workplace our brains
[2907.64 - 2912.12] and when your brain doesn't have the
[2909.16 - 2914.52] right oils in the diet which is omega-3
[2912.12 - 2917.04] all you have to do is add Shia seeds
[2914.52 - 2920.32] flax seeds and if you're a
[2917.04 - 2923.52] non-vegetarian uh mackerel salmon and
[2920.32 - 2927.40] chovies I can do a 15 to 18 hour
[2923.52 - 2929.92] non-stop lecture ask my team I'm at it
[2927.40 - 2931.52] the brain is good because it's got the
[2929.92 - 2934.28] right raw material so if you're putting
[2931.52 - 2935.88] that for an anxiety I'm telling you most
[2934.28 - 2937.96] of your problem so my wife things I'm
[2935.88 - 2940.24] very insensitive
[2937.96 - 2942.04] breaking news so and so so and so
[2940.24 - 2944.96] anxiety and blah blah blah committed
[2942.04 - 2946.64] suicide and I'm like is B12 defic my
[2944.96 - 2949.12] wife's like you're so insensitive I'm
[2946.64 - 2951.28] like no I'm not it's B complex
[2949.12 - 2954.04] deficiency it's nutritional deficiency
[2951.28 - 2956.32] India is not eating correctly forget the
[2954.04 - 2958.68] workplace start eating correctly so if
[2956.32 - 2961.12] you can get your people to just do that
[2958.68 - 2963.60] blood test in the vitamin and mineral
[2961.12 - 2966.20] department and if you can organization
[2963.60 - 2967.80] can afford a screening of the poop the
[2966.20 - 2970.40] employees going to be like you want to
[2967.80 - 2972.04] check my now it's like this is
[2970.40 - 2974.44] going to be the future massive invasion
[2972.04 - 2976.88] of privacy massive invasion of
[2974.44 - 2978.60] privacy uh we talking about omega3 this
[2976.88 - 2985.08] is more a personal question Ali bed
[2978.60 - 2985.08] omega3 or fish bed Omega uh so good
[2985.96 - 2992.80] question so fish based omega-3 have two
[2989.96 - 2996.12] guys in it EPA and dhf so if you can you
[2992.80 - 3000.76] can think of two two managers uh EPA is
[2996.12 - 3004.20] like the C CFO and uh DHA is like the
[3000.76 - 3007.12] COO okay now in alga Omega you get more
[3004.20 - 3010.76] of the DHA guy the COO guy you you don't
[3007.12 - 3014.16] get the other guy so if your genetics
[3010.76 - 3018.32] are good to produce the necessary
[3014.16 - 3020.48] Omega-3s alga omega-3 is good enough the
[3018.32 - 3022.48] The Dilemma for me comes when somebody
[3020.48 - 3024.48] says I'm a staunch
[3022.48 - 3027.40] vegetarian then I'm like at least take
[3024.48 - 3030.12] an algal omega-3 but if you say to me
[3027.40 - 3032.12] that you know um it's okay I can take a
[3030.12 - 3035.64] fish oil supplement and I'm like okay
[3032.12 - 3038.08] you're taking EP and DHA of minimum 500
[3035.64 - 3039.76] migr per capsule or better still eat
[3038.08 - 3043.24] this fish or better
[3039.76 - 3046.44] still have fish-based omega-3 the
[3043.24 - 3050.44] vegetarian a flax seeds vegan algae
[3046.44 - 3051.96] Omega but I would recommend every V
[3050.44 - 3054.64] vegetarian on the planet I have no
[3051.96 - 3057.44] commercial affiliation to any company
[3054.64 - 3059.76] the the vegetarian vegan Al Omega which
[3057.44 - 3062.00] comes from the ocean is a supplement
[3059.76 - 3064.76] that I would prescribe to the entire
[3062.00 - 3068.76] Workforce in India unless you have a CV
[3064.76 - 3070.60] delery okay I think let's uh close this
[3068.76 - 3072.44] and open this up for the audience what's
[3070.60 - 3074.96] one one thing that you would suggest to
[3072.44 - 3077.00] everyone in the audience who's primarily
[3074.96 - 3078.36] you know uh designing a wellness program
[3077.00 - 3081.20] was one thing that they could start
[3078.36 - 3083.24] doing from Tomorrow onwards everybody is
[3081.20 - 3085.84] doing blood tests in your
[3083.24 - 3087.40] organizations get a company to come in
[3085.84 - 3089.44] and say with will you talk to my
[3087.40 - 3092.40] employees about five things with that
[3089.44 - 3094.28] blood test that they can do to improve
[3092.40 - 3095.96] the blood test the next year and give
[3094.28 - 3098.60] them a carrot that this year your
[3095.96 - 3101.16] cholesterol was 240 without medication
[3098.60 - 3104.32] in the next 6 months if it goes down you
[3101.16 - 3107.28] get kabani Park trip or something like
[3104.32 - 3109.16] that because you got to motivate people
[3107.28 - 3111.24] and you need to do it only once the
[3109.16 - 3112.68] moment the fitness bug bites that person
[3111.24 - 3115.36] you will see this in your own
[3112.68 - 3118.08] organization there'll be that one silent
[3115.36 - 3119.88] person that motivates every by a by
[3118.08 - 3121.48] let's go for a walk then two people
[3119.88 - 3123.80] start joining then four people start
[3121.48 - 3125.84] joining you need to have that Collective
[3123.80 - 3128.96] enthusiasm being built start with the
[3125.84 - 3132.08] blood test I believe that is the
[3128.96 - 3135.24] starting point in India because that is
[3132.08 - 3138.04] the report card of your employee that's
[3135.24 - 3141.32] it all right I think we can open this up
[3138.04 - 3145.88] for questions now if someone I think yes
[3141.32 - 3145.88] that person ra the first
[3175.44 - 3183.00] SE walking every day but she no so when
[3180.24 - 3186.32] you had that we need to walk so what
[3183.00 - 3186.32] type of walking
[3192.12 - 3198.56] will what of walk would you
[3196.12 - 3200.32] suggest very good question because
[3198.56 - 3201.76] you've taken out the most important
[3200.32 - 3203.76] thing of the equation which is everyone
[3201.76 - 3205.16] wants to walk to lose weight so if you
[3203.76 - 3208.36] take that out and you're walking for
[3205.16 - 3211.28] help then even if you do 4 to 6,000
[3208.36 - 3213.28] steps a day number one now an average
[3211.28 - 3216.08] person of Indian height both male and
[3213.28 - 3218.40] female 4 to 6,000 steps will take you 1
[3216.08 - 3220.92] hour so the question is to ask do I have
[3218.40 - 3223.20] 1 hour in the day and that 4 to 6,000
[3220.92 - 3224.52] steps actually confers upon you
[3223.20 - 3227.12] cardiovascular
[3224.52 - 3228.84] benefits movement of your gut so you
[3227.12 - 3233.20] have a better bowel movement the next
[3228.84 - 3235.60] day um uh joints when you walk you don't
[3233.20 - 3237.72] need to power walk or walk super fast
[3235.60 - 3239.36] where you're slamming ing your legs on
[3237.72 - 3240.88] the foot path by going faster because
[3239.36 - 3242.84] you're putting a load on your knees
[3240.88 - 3246.68] always tell people if you're walking for
[3242.84 - 3248.24] health walk gingerly walk Happy Walk
[3246.68 - 3251.68] listening to your best songs in the
[3248.24 - 3254.36] morning or in the evening walk on walk
[3251.68 - 3257.16] on soft cushion floor which is grass or
[3254.36 - 3259.04] mud uh but we live in city so we have a
[3257.16 - 3261.92] lot of concrete the worst walking you
[3259.04 - 3264.36] can do is on the power treadmills I'd
[3261.92 - 3265.80] rather you cycle on a cycle and watch
[3264.36 - 3269.64] your favorite program in the evening
[3265.80 - 3269.64] versus walking on a treadmill in your
[3269.76 - 3272.76] house
[3276.92 - 3281.64] treine look as a nutritionist when
[3279.68 - 3284.28] people say brisk
[3281.64 - 3286.76] walking I my next question is yes please
[3284.28 - 3289.24] brisk walk but how much so the next
[3286.76 - 3291.20] question is I have only so much of time
[3289.24 - 3293.48] so then I will say okay you got 45
[3291.20 - 3295.64] minutes you can if you can brisk walk
[3293.48 - 3297.56] and your heart can take it so when
[3295.64 - 3299.28] people can afford exercise variables
[3297.56 - 3301.32] which is another thing that I would
[3299.28 - 3303.68] encourage organization some people it
[3301.32 - 3305.56] gives anxiety some people the exercise
[3303.68 - 3308.64] variables is a great thing total number
[3305.56 - 3311.44] of steps duration of time to to finish
[3308.64 - 3314.60] those steps basically what you do is
[3311.44 - 3319.08] brisk walk is a very qualitative
[3314.60 - 3322.84] term how fast did you walk what distance
[3319.08 - 3325.28] in a time is a quantitative measure for
[3322.84 - 3329.08] every person all I want that person over
[3325.28 - 3332.80] 365 days is to show an incremental
[3329.08 - 3336.36] benefit of walking how number of steps
[3332.80 - 3338.16] over the years so first month so first
[3336.36 - 3341.16] month they had 1 lakh Target then next
[3338.16 - 3342.88] month one 1 lakh 10,000 and by the end
[3341.16 - 3347.20] of the year they've hit let's say 4
[3342.88 - 3349.80] lakhs per month steps but they do it in
[3347.20 - 3352.36] 45 minutes or 35 minutes so that means a
[3349.80 - 3354.68] walk is becoming more brisker and the
[3352.36 - 3356.84] final metrics is at the beginning of the
[3354.68 - 3359.44] year when I walked at this
[3356.84 - 3362.72] distance and time my resting heart rate
[3359.44 - 3364.56] went up to 155 160 by the end of the
[3362.72 - 3366.56] year my resting heart rate is only 130
[3364.56 - 3369.00] when I do the same distance that is
[3366.56 - 3372.04] called cardiovascular trained
[3369.00 - 3374.96] Fitness so the idea is always look at
[3372.04 - 3377.20] the quantitative measure how does your
[3374.96 - 3379.80] body feel and one advice I will give
[3377.20 - 3382.44] people you suddenly start walking
[3379.80 - 3386.32] without stretching you are going to
[3382.44 - 3389.44] injure your joints you have to slow
[3386.32 - 3391.44] stretch walk slowly stretch your cares
[3389.44 - 3393.76] hamstring and you know what if you're
[3391.44 - 3395.72] earning enough of money hire a trainer
[3393.76 - 3397.84] for the first month just to teach you
[3395.72 - 3400.04] how to walk or download the videos which
[3397.84 - 3404.24] teach you about warm up before you start
[3400.04 - 3407.28] walking then walk for 30 to 90 days Aram
[3404.24 - 3410.56] say after 90 days start brisk
[3407.28 - 3410.56] walking next
[3413.96 - 3418.64] question so hi my name is
[3416.84 - 3421.72] I hope foro first of all love the
[3418.64 - 3423.76] session the way it is conducted and and
[3421.72 - 3426.00] I could correlate with the way you are
[3423.76 - 3428.52] giving example right so I also give one
[3426.00 - 3431.16] small one earlier I was working for IND
[3428.52 - 3434.16] Airlines I was reading the South Region
[3431.16 - 3437.28] so I had my manager so she was a fitness
[3434.16 - 3439.88] freak right so looking at her veget what
[3437.28 - 3442.72] what lunch box she used to
[3439.88 - 3444.68] buy not by what she used to get right we
[3442.72 - 3446.64] used to measure her you know Wellness
[3444.68 - 3448.52] level right she's getting the car or any
[3446.64 - 3450.36] vegetable we know it's a good mode but
[3448.52 - 3452.20] if it's to be a papaya or something else
[3450.36 - 3454.76] we know that that day we not going to go
[3452.20 - 3456.96] not talk to them that was Li note but
[3454.76 - 3459.24] yeah that that really happened and trust
[3456.96 - 3461.56] me you know the toughest discussions we
[3459.24 - 3463.60] had when she had got a good food that's
[3461.56 - 3466.80] one thing now coming back to my question
[3463.60 - 3469.00] my question was that I'm leading a
[3466.80 - 3470.44] business which has an average age of 28
[3469.00 - 3475.44] to
[3470.44 - 3477.00] 48 right so does age matter when we do
[3475.44 - 3480.76] anything
[3477.00 - 3484.96] it's a one size all something we can do
[3480.76 - 3488.40] right very good question um very good
[3484.96 - 3490.64] question I mean I I would ask myself
[3488.40 - 3493.44] this question as founder of my quand
[3490.64 - 3496.36] clinics I have about 180 employees today
[3493.44 - 3499.52] and um we we grew over the last 2 three
[3496.36 - 3502.80] years and um initially I thought that I
[3499.52 - 3505.24] want older dietitians older employees
[3502.80 - 3507.00] but I'm also finding that younger
[3505.24 - 3511.80] employees come with with This brilliant
[3507.00 - 3514.68] spark in them or U uncluttered ideas
[3511.80 - 3517.40] ideas that are not U you know coming
[3514.68 - 3519.76] with baggage with them so now let me
[3517.40 - 3522.04] answer this question as a non- business
[3519.76 - 3525.64] person but as a
[3522.04 - 3528.16] nutritionist I am 48 years of age my
[3525.64 - 3532.32] metabolic age is
[3528.16 - 3534.36] 34 I can conduct a meeting for 15 hours
[3532.32 - 3536.32] and the 34 yearold in my team is fallen
[3534.36 - 3539.72] asleep
[3536.32 - 3539.72] my point being sir
[3539.80 - 3544.96] is this the psychometrics by which you
[3542.44 - 3547.92] recruit somebody should never be defined
[3544.96 - 3550.68] by a number I have seven employees in my
[3547.92 - 3553.64] company are over 60 years of age and
[3550.68 - 3556.32] they bring a flavor of responsibility
[3553.64 - 3558.12] turning up at 8:00 in the uh 8:00 in the
[3556.32 - 3560.72] morning the company and they look at the
[3558.12 - 3562.28] youngsters and like there are problem we
[3560.72 - 3564.16] are old people we can't even get out bed
[3562.28 - 3566.56] and we are here in the office before you
[3564.16 - 3569.28] and the youngsters are like by we don't
[3566.56 - 3572.28] watch Netflix like you buggers so the
[3569.28 - 3575.92] point is you need to figure out the
[3572.28 - 3578.92] people you recruiting for that team and
[3575.92 - 3581.00] only the team leader the business owner
[3578.92 - 3584.20] and the HR people can figure out the
[3581.00 - 3588.24] best mix don't discount somebody for
[3584.20 - 3590.96] their age their weight their gender or
[3588.24 - 3593.96] even their cultural disposition in our
[3590.96 - 3593.96] country
[3596.36 - 3601.60] you know so there's a lot of racism
[3599.40 - 3603.80] within our country in our workspace I
[3601.60 - 3606.80] don't think we should Define age I would
[3603.80 - 3609.76] do this I would do that blood
[3606.80 - 3611.76] test and if you see bad
[3609.76 - 3613.32] parameters and and I've actually done
[3611.76 - 3614.68] this in organization I've told a person
[3613.32 - 3616.48] your parameters are very bad you're a
[3614.68 - 3618.68] smoker I'm recruiting you as a
[3616.48 - 3620.40] consultant for 6 months give up smoking
[3618.68 - 3621.40] improve these parameters I'll confirm
[3620.40 - 3624.72] you as an
[3621.40 - 3626.64] employee so now that person's motivated
[3624.72 - 3628.84] to kind of do that so then I go back to
[3626.64 - 3630.88] my hrn is the person doing it no they're
[3628.84 - 3633.64] not doing it then that person will not
[3630.88 - 3635.60] bring that go getting energy to my team
[3633.64 - 3637.24] because if you can't change your life
[3635.60 - 3640.00] where the hell are you going to change
[3637.24 - 3641.72] the variables of doing something in that
[3640.00 - 3643.04] business which will contribute to the
[3641.72 - 3645.44] growth of my team which will contribute
[3643.04 - 3649.64] to the growth of my
[3645.44 - 3649.64] company next question yes
[3653.72 - 3657.92] sir hi Kik
[3679.36 - 3684.56] yes so it's a good question okay um
[3683.16 - 3686.28] there are two types of people on the
[3684.56 - 3688.88] planet salt responders and salt
[3686.28 - 3691.40] non-responders so you can get BP even
[3688.88 - 3692.72] without a higher sodium so the first
[3691.40 - 3695.00] thing that I would do is when a person
[3692.72 - 3698.08] comes to me with the cases I would look
[3695.00 - 3699.56] whether the the BP is driven by salt or
[3698.08 - 3701.80] not and there's a genetic test to do
[3699.56 - 3703.68] that because if it's not driven by salt
[3701.80 - 3705.84] then I tell the person you can eat any
[3703.68 - 3707.08] salt but too much of salt causes water
[3705.84 - 3708.20] retention which affects your kidney
[3707.08 - 3711.56] which is causes your blood pressure to
[3708.20 - 3716.24] go up so bottom line is
[3711.56 - 3718.24] namako then we come to which namok now
[3716.24 - 3719.40] people like to create marketing out of
[3718.24 - 3722.16] everything because there a demand and
[3719.40 - 3724.44] Supply in today's world pink salt and
[3722.16 - 3725.52] Celtic salt are salts that have a lower
[3724.44 - 3728.76] sodium
[3725.52 - 3732.88] content but this is General marketing
[3728.76 - 3735.28] say please understand manufactured salt
[3732.88 - 3739.52] is the perfect salt because it has the
[3735.28 - 3743.36] right amount of sodium constructed in it
[3739.52 - 3744.56] whereas rock salt or Celtic salt or any
[3743.36 - 3747.08] other salt that is there which is
[3744.56 - 3749.80] derived from nature when that salt is
[3747.08 - 3752.84] produced from that pool we do not know
[3749.80 - 3755.48] the mineral content at that time and age
[3752.84 - 3758.72] when that salt was made therefore the
[3755.48 - 3762.12] variability factor in that
[3758.72 - 3764.48] salt is my conclusion saying that boss
[3762.12 - 3768.04] I'd rather go with a known devil which
[3764.48 - 3770.52] is XYZ brand low sodium
[3768.04 - 3772.96] salt when you want to use this pink salt
[3770.52 - 3775.16] and Celtic salt I would say you use it
[3772.96 - 3776.56] on top of your salads or in your
[3775.16 - 3778.08] sparkling water water when you want to
[3776.56 - 3781.92] be a little bit
[3778.08 - 3786.20] better bottom line is people get BP
[3781.92 - 3788.40] today because from a very young age uh
[3786.20 - 3791.60] if you come to my house Mr Karthik you
[3788.40 - 3793.08] will not find a salt shaker in my house
[3791.60 - 3794.68] my parents recently came my mom's like
[3793.08 - 3796.84] where's the salt shaker I'm like there's
[3794.68 - 3798.20] no salt shaker what sort of person are
[3796.84 - 3799.80] you you don't have any table maners
[3798.20 - 3801.52] there should be salt and pepper I'm like
[3799.80 - 3803.68] Mom there's no salt and pepper shaker
[3801.52 - 3806.28] because my son at 11 will start putting
[3803.68 - 3809.04] salt in food then he becomes years old
[3806.28 - 3810.72] he goes to the fortune Fire Company he
[3809.04 - 3812.08] puts salt in his food when he's 30 he
[3810.72 - 3813.60] puts salt in his food he tells his wife
[3812.08 - 3814.60] not enough salt is than food what your
[3813.60 - 3816.76] mother didn't teach you how to cook
[3814.60 - 3818.44] properly he puts more salt in the food
[3816.76 - 3821.40] he reaches 40 there's so much of salt in
[3818.44 - 3823.96] his body he got BP so the starting point
[3821.40 - 3826.68] is removing the salt shaker for the next
[3823.96 - 3829.68] generation of children in your
[3826.68 - 3831.80] family thank you I think I have one
[3829.68 - 3833.76] question we were talking about earlier
[3831.80 - 3836.64] so this is more like a r fire thing
[3833.76 - 3839.20] intermittent fasting or
[3836.64 - 3841.32] 100% if you are overweight if you've got
[3839.20 - 3843.28] a punch your waist size your dress
[3841.32 - 3844.80] doesn't fit you your SAR doesn't fit you
[3843.28 - 3847.68] you're a guy where your belly sticking
[3844.80 - 3849.96] over your um you know what I'm trying to
[3847.68 - 3851.76] say right yes to intermittent fasting
[3849.96 - 3853.24] the human race is eating too much
[3851.76 - 3856.80] intermittent fasting is not going to
[3853.24 - 3859.28] destroy you how to do it is the secret I
[3856.80 - 3862.08] would suggest to coroporate India to
[3859.28 - 3864.16] delay your breakfast come early and eat
[3862.08 - 3866.08] a lunch at 12: and try and eat your
[3864.16 - 3869.12] dinner as early as possible so you
[3866.08 - 3870.68] shorten the eating window uh but for
[3869.12 - 3872.96] those of you who don't want to do eating
[3870.68 - 3875.44] uh intermittent fasting the simplest
[3872.96 - 3875.44] rule is
[3877.44 - 3883.12] keep start fasting in chapati
[3880.52 - 3886.00] and is that the reason why we tend to be
[3883.12 - 3887.96] more skinny fat with respect to our body
[3886.00 - 3889.68] I I think as I said we're des chalkies
[3887.96 - 3892.12] and we're still eating like how Mama and
[3889.68 - 3895.20] Papa have eaten but Mama and Papa have
[3892.12 - 3897.20] walked 5 8 kilomet a day I don't have my
[3895.20 - 3899.32] exercise able today but I'm assuming
[3897.20 - 3901.68] today I would have walked no more than 1
[3899.32 - 3903.80] kilom right I just came I was dropped
[3901.68 - 3906.16] right over here few steps here and there
[3903.80 - 3907.40] so we are not moving so because we not
[3906.16 - 3910.20] moving this is a big problem so
[3907.40 - 3912.48] intermittent fasting works it has
[3910.20 - 3914.80] magnificent benefits only if you have a
[3912.48 - 3916.72] medical problem consult a medical
[3914.80 - 3919.12] dietician when you're doing intermittent
[3916.72 - 3922.76] fasting our ancestors did fasting
[3919.12 - 3925.00] shivaratri navaratri uh Raman uh lent
[3922.76 - 3926.56] season we had fasting written our
[3925.00 - 3928.96] spiritual books
[3926.56 - 3931.24] unfortunately the new generation that we
[3928.96 - 3934.24] are we have become lazy religious
[3931.24 - 3936.48] spiritual people so we don't subscribe
[3934.24 - 3938.60] to what our dadas and parents do more
[3936.48 - 3940.40] aggressively in spirituality which has
[3938.60 - 3943.28] fasting written in
[3940.40 - 3945.88] it very very insightful session I think
