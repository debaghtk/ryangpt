[0.00 - 3.92] got my apple cufflinks
[1.92 - 6.48] on
[3.92 - 8.64] and i think it's pomegranate so today's
[6.48 - 10.72] session is all about
[8.64 - 13.52] anybody
[10.72 - 15.92] who wants to make a resolution in 2022
[13.52 - 17.28] anyone who's wanting to exercise and put
[15.92 - 19.20] on more muscle
[17.28 - 20.16] anyone who wants to exercise and lose
[19.20 - 22.56] fat
[20.16 - 24.56] anyone who's exercising and worried like
[22.56 - 26.16] me at 47 that when i run on the
[24.56 - 28.00] treadmill i'm like okay am i gonna get a
[26.16 - 30.56] heart attack or not
[28.00 - 32.48] and i brought together two experts my
[30.56 - 35.04] first expert coming in
[32.48 - 37.28] is uh dr ashish contractor he's an old
[35.04 - 38.80] friend he's written a book called the
[37.28 - 40.24] heart truth i'm going to get him on
[38.80 - 43.52] board right now
[40.24 - 46.40] and i have shwetambrichetti who is an
[43.52 - 47.92] old friend of mine uh where we did a
[46.40 - 49.60] radio show together and we have
[47.92 - 51.84] continued to work together i do
[49.60 - 54.56] shwathamri's diet every now and then
[51.84 - 57.92] she's recently become a mom and trust me
[54.56 - 60.32] she looks the same when i knew she was a
[57.92 - 62.48] single person fit as ever so let me get
[60.32 - 64.72] both of them in over here
[62.48 - 66.48] i think dr ashley says in over here hey
[64.72 - 69.52] ashish how are you doing
[66.48 - 72.16] very good ryan so happy happy new year
[69.52 - 73.92] to you and to all the listeners and you
[72.16 - 75.84] said sritambri looks the same as when
[73.92 - 77.52] you saw her years ago if you have not
[75.84 - 79.60] seen her earlier she definitely does
[77.52 - 81.44] look young to me but you also look the
[79.60 - 83.44] same so when you said you're 47 that
[81.44 - 85.20] kind of took me by surprise so you're
[83.44 - 87.92] obviously doing something something like
[85.20 - 90.32] yourself yeah i i eat a pomegranate a
[87.92 - 92.80] day so the research was done ashish
[90.32 - 95.28] apparently a pomegranate
[92.80 - 96.80] the seeds of the pomegranate if you bite
[95.28 - 98.48] them and eat them or put them in your
[96.80 - 101.20] old sumit blender
[98.48 - 103.76] releases omega 5 fatty acid which has an
[101.20 - 106.24] anti-aging effect
[103.76 - 108.64] and the pomegranate also releases more
[106.24 - 111.76] nitric oxide which from your perspective
[108.64 - 112.84] as a cardiology exercise specialist this
[111.76 - 115.28] better
[112.84 - 118.08] vasodilation so pomegranate a day will
[115.28 - 119.92] probably keep dr ashish away but talking
[118.08 - 122.32] about dr ashish you've written an
[119.92 - 123.84] amazing book called the heart root and i
[122.32 - 126.24] i think that's why i called you in today
[123.84 - 128.32] because um i recently had a client a
[126.24 - 130.72] very dear client of mine the film star
[128.32 - 132.72] punit rajkumar who passed away because
[130.72 - 133.84] of a heart attack
[132.72 - 135.84] now
[133.84 - 138.48] every one of my clients every one of my
[135.84 - 141.68] friends everyone is like in 2020 and
[138.48 - 143.76] 2021 we saw a lot of people corporate
[141.68 - 145.12] ceos running on treadmills and
[143.76 - 147.28] collapsing of heart attacks and i
[145.12 - 148.88] thought who better than to invite dr
[147.28 - 151.28] ashish who's the
[148.88 - 152.96] race medical director in the mumbai
[151.28 - 155.04] marathon so if any
[152.96 - 156.96] any marathon happens and we are running
[155.04 - 159.04] over there dr ashish is the guy that's
[156.96 - 160.16] saving our life uh hopefully you don't
[159.04 - 162.40] get a heart attack when you run so
[160.16 - 166.48] ashish my first question to you doc is
[162.40 - 168.80] that uh is it okay to exercise in 2022
[166.48 - 171.92] thanks ryan you know it's it's actually
[168.80 - 174.08] quite quite sad and quite ironic
[171.92 - 176.56] that over the last year because we've
[174.08 - 180.00] had these unfortunate events
[176.56 - 183.12] we are being asked the reverse question
[180.00 - 185.68] normally people should ask or is it bad
[183.12 - 188.64] not to exercise how can i or my loved
[185.68 - 190.72] one exercise and today over the last
[188.64 - 192.64] year year and a half people are asking
[190.72 - 195.04] the question in reverse
[192.64 - 196.80] um so give me a couple of minutes to
[195.04 - 198.32] talk on this subject because it's
[196.80 - 200.88] something which you know you can't have
[198.32 - 203.84] a one liner on and ironically since the
[200.88 - 206.48] last four five months i've done probably
[203.84 - 209.20] ten different podcasts and events such
[206.48 - 212.64] as this around this subject and yours
[209.20 - 215.52] let me distill it down for you exercise
[212.64 - 218.56] is absolutely fabulous if we could put
[215.52 - 220.88] all the benefits of exercise into a pill
[218.56 - 222.72] it would probably be the best selling
[220.88 - 224.88] pill ever okay
[222.72 - 228.48] apart from your heart
[224.88 - 231.36] stroke cancer pretty much every chronic
[228.48 - 233.76] disease known to man exercise reduces
[231.36 - 236.48] your risk of getting it and in god
[233.76 - 238.32] forbid you have got it exercise improves
[236.48 - 240.16] your quality of life and reduces your
[238.32 - 243.44] chance of it becoming worse that's
[240.16 - 244.40] enough in a nutshell okay having said
[243.44 - 247.92] that
[244.40 - 249.76] exercise does not provide immunity
[247.92 - 252.00] against heart attack and death and this
[249.76 - 255.68] is where people make a mistake
[252.00 - 258.72] just because someone is exercising does
[255.68 - 260.56] not mean they cannot have an event
[258.72 - 263.44] since we are talking about the subject
[260.56 - 265.44] of heart there are different risk
[263.44 - 267.28] factors which contribute towards a
[265.44 - 269.28] person having a heart attack okay the
[267.28 - 271.28] usual ones which i'm sure you've spoken
[269.28 - 274.64] about several times in the past
[271.28 - 276.24] smoking diabetes high blood pressure
[274.64 - 277.68] high cholesterol
[276.24 - 279.12] heavy weight
[277.68 - 281.76] genetics
[279.12 - 283.92] and last is lack of exercise so
[281.76 - 286.64] obviously if you're exercising you're
[283.92 - 288.64] getting rid of one risk factor but
[286.64 - 291.28] doesn't mean that you cannot have now
[288.64 - 293.84] all these people who unfortunately died
[291.28 - 296.32] young i cannot comment on what their
[293.84 - 297.04] risk factors were because i do not know
[296.32 - 299.36] it
[297.04 - 300.48] but i just want to say that just because
[299.36 - 303.36] you're fit
[300.48 - 305.44] does not mean you have immunity you have
[303.36 - 307.68] protection but not immunity and that's
[305.44 - 310.80] what people need to understand one
[307.68 - 313.64] final point when people who are very
[310.80 - 316.08] well known have an event it also makes
[313.64 - 318.24] disproportionate views in the headline
[316.08 - 320.96] when people are exercising and they have
[318.24 - 322.88] an event it makes disproportional news
[320.96 - 325.04] you rarely read in the newspaper
[322.88 - 327.28] somebody sitting at home watching tv has
[325.04 - 329.12] a heart attack doesn't make the news but
[327.28 - 331.76] if the person was in a gym or outdoor
[329.12 - 334.40] exercising it does make the move so
[331.76 - 336.72] exercise is beneficial so doc you you
[334.40 - 337.92] used a very very important point and i i
[336.72 - 339.12] want to ask the maximum number of
[337.92 - 340.96] questions before i let you go i know
[339.12 - 343.36] you're very busy at the hospital
[340.96 - 345.60] um you said immunity doesn't confirm
[343.36 - 347.20] immunity so ryan fernando wants to work
[345.60 - 349.52] out in 2022.
[347.20 - 351.84] doc i want immunity what are the things
[349.52 - 354.16] that i should test for can i come and
[351.84 - 355.84] visit you at hn reliance hospital and
[354.16 - 357.20] can you get me running on a treadmill
[355.84 - 359.84] what's what what do i need to do in
[357.20 - 361.52] 2022. so you know you're you're most
[359.84 - 363.04] welcome to visit you've been threatening
[361.52 - 364.72] to do that for the last five years but
[363.04 - 367.20] you haven't yet done it
[364.72 - 369.92] but so here's the point i think
[367.20 - 372.48] to start with every adult should know
[369.92 - 374.48] some very basic numbers okay you must
[372.48 - 375.84] know your height and weight i know i'm
[374.48 - 377.36] stating the obvious but there are so
[375.84 - 379.28] many people who don't
[377.36 - 380.88] you must know at least once a year your
[379.28 - 383.60] blood pressure
[380.88 - 385.36] your cholesterol your sugar
[383.60 - 387.68] these are all simple things which can be
[385.36 - 389.36] done with one simple inexpensive blood
[387.68 - 391.44] test and somebody measuring your blood
[389.36 - 393.92] pressure the problem is these are all
[391.44 - 396.00] silent issues all these three big ones
[393.92 - 398.48] blood pressure cholesterol and sugar if
[396.00 - 400.88] your numbers are way high
[398.48 - 402.72] you won't know it until you measure it
[400.88 - 404.64] so if you ask a room full of people do
[402.72 - 406.56] you have you know high cholesterol very
[404.64 - 407.76] few people may put the end up but then
[406.56 - 409.76] if you ask them how many of you have
[407.76 - 411.52] actually measured in the last one year
[409.76 - 413.68] again very few people will put the hand
[411.52 - 415.36] up so you can't assume you've got good
[413.68 - 417.44] cholesterol or sugar or blood pressure
[415.36 - 419.68] until you measure it so if this is the
[417.44 - 422.56] minimum testing you need to do once a
[419.68 - 423.52] year now if any of these numbers come
[422.56 - 425.92] high
[423.52 - 428.24] then yes you need to test further
[425.92 - 430.48] something else i would two more points i
[428.24 - 432.88] would add if somebody has a strong
[430.48 - 435.36] family history of heart disease by that
[432.88 - 437.92] i mean some direct relation mother
[435.36 - 440.32] father brother sister has
[437.92 - 442.16] has died young when i say young say
[440.32 - 444.56] below the age of 60. not just had a
[442.16 - 446.80] heart disease but died young below the
[444.56 - 449.36] age of 60. that would be a sort of a
[446.80 - 451.68] alarm bell in my mind so speak to your
[449.36 - 453.20] doctor he or she may want you to do
[451.68 - 455.52] further tests
[453.20 - 458.08] if you want to embark on vigorous
[455.52 - 460.96] exercise right not just a simple brisk
[458.08 - 463.20] walking program if you want to embark on
[460.96 - 465.04] in vigorous exercise talk to your
[463.20 - 467.92] doctors to see whether additional tests
[465.04 - 471.28] are required or not
[467.92 - 472.80] okay so that's that's that's awesome um
[471.28 - 475.68] most of the people that work with
[472.80 - 478.88] swethambri uh in terms of fitness
[475.68 - 481.44] all of us are in this young age of 40 to
[478.88 - 483.44] 60 and we feel very invincible we're
[481.44 - 485.12] doing this cholesterol test
[483.44 - 486.72] but they'd still go they just do a
[485.12 - 488.96] workout and go down to the pub and then
[486.72 - 490.32] have all that unhealthy food and stuff
[488.96 - 492.80] like that
[490.32 - 495.28] what more should they do because i'm
[492.80 - 497.60] seeing people coming with esr c reactive
[495.28 - 501.52] protein lipoprotein a lipoprotein b all
[497.60 - 504.16] of this is high uh hb a1c is also high
[501.52 - 505.76] uh will meeting a cardiologist as a
[504.16 - 508.64] preventive factor
[505.76 - 511.52] and will maybe screening for genetics uh
[508.64 - 513.60] from that perspective help a client
[511.52 - 515.36] okay so you hit a good point so there
[513.60 - 517.60] are a lot of people
[515.36 - 520.72] who are very fit
[517.60 - 523.92] but they engage in unhealthy behaviors
[520.72 - 526.16] okay so again you may be very fit you
[523.92 - 528.24] may play a great game of tennis or
[526.16 - 530.56] squash or run a quick marathon but you
[528.24 - 532.32] may still be smoking for example
[530.56 - 533.84] so you know you need to take care of
[532.32 - 535.44] your health behavior there's another
[533.84 - 537.68] very well known phrase which you'll
[535.44 - 539.76] identify with which says you cannot
[537.68 - 541.76] outrun a bad diet
[539.76 - 544.00] true so just because you're running mile
[541.76 - 546.40] after mile doesn't mean people say oh
[544.00 - 549.20] he's so thin he's so fit he can eat
[546.40 - 552.40] anything no you cannot eat anything just
[549.20 - 554.08] because you look fine or if you exercise
[552.40 - 557.52] some of the things you mention your
[554.08 - 560.00] lipoprotein small a you know esr c
[557.52 - 562.40] reactive protein a lot of them are
[560.00 - 565.20] markers of what's called inflammation in
[562.40 - 567.84] the body and there are sort of theories
[565.20 - 569.76] that inflammation is the genesis of a
[567.84 - 572.80] lot of heart disease and other diseases
[569.76 - 575.68] as well so yes under the guidance of a
[572.80 - 578.08] good nutritionist a good doctor for the
[575.68 - 580.48] testing would be helpful especially if
[578.08 - 583.12] you have a family history um i don't
[580.48 - 585.20] suggest a specific set of tests which
[583.12 - 587.12] everyone needs to do without talking to
[585.20 - 589.12] the doctor but all the tests you
[587.12 - 591.04] mentioned are for some of the newer risk
[589.12 - 594.00] factors like you mentioned lipoprotein
[591.04 - 595.44] small a homocysteine in the right subset
[594.00 - 597.44] they should be mentioned
[595.44 - 599.20] so i i have questions coming in live
[597.44 - 601.52] because we're going off facebook and
[599.20 - 603.36] linkedin and somebody somebody's asked
[601.52 - 605.60] doc what is the difference between a
[603.36 - 607.60] stroke and a heart attack
[605.60 - 609.44] okay so let me tell you the difference
[607.60 - 611.68] between not only a stroke and a heart
[609.44 - 614.16] attack but also a cardiac arrest and a
[611.68 - 615.92] heart attack that people um get more
[614.16 - 617.92] confused with oh even i don't know the
[615.92 - 620.40] difference between two yeah so stroke
[617.92 - 622.72] first of all the same way a stroke is a
[620.40 - 624.24] brain attack it's very simple when we
[622.72 - 625.92] say heart attack is because there are
[624.24 - 628.16] blockages in the heart arteries and a
[625.92 - 630.32] blockage erupts and that causes a heart
[628.16 - 632.48] attack similarly when you have a problem
[630.32 - 634.32] in the brain the artery either the art
[632.48 - 636.88] there are two types of strokes one is
[634.32 - 638.80] called hemorrhagic when the blood vessel
[636.88 - 640.72] ruptures that's about five to ten
[638.80 - 642.56] percent the other is when there are
[640.72 - 645.52] blockages that's called ischemic which
[642.56 - 647.92] is more common so stroke in simple words
[645.52 - 649.84] is a brain attack okay same way as a
[647.92 - 651.84] heart attack is a brain attack same risk
[649.84 - 655.84] factors blood pressure cholesterol
[651.84 - 657.20] diabetes smoking all the usual suspects
[655.84 - 659.68] let me tell you the difference between a
[657.20 - 662.24] heart attack and a cardiac arrest
[659.68 - 665.68] cardiac arrest as the name suggests is
[662.24 - 668.00] when the heart essentially stops beating
[665.68 - 671.04] or stops functioning so pretty much
[668.00 - 672.72] everyone before they before their final
[671.04 - 675.60] breath so to speak
[672.72 - 678.96] they're in a cardiac arrest
[675.60 - 682.80] now a heart attack is the commonest
[678.96 - 684.96] cause of a cardiac arrest but every
[682.80 - 687.28] heart attack does not lead to a cardiac
[684.96 - 689.20] arrest okay one out of three heart
[687.28 - 690.56] attacks tend to be kill people on the
[689.20 - 692.24] spot and they probably lead to the
[690.56 - 694.96] cardiac arrest
[692.24 - 697.04] at the same time a heart attack is not
[694.96 - 698.56] the only reason for someone having a
[697.04 - 700.80] cardiac arrest let's say you put your
[698.56 - 702.96] hand in a big electrical system and you
[700.80 - 704.32] get electrocuted you will go into
[702.96 - 706.32] cardiac arrest
[704.32 - 708.80] a lot of the deaths
[706.32 - 711.84] that we see in young people now young i
[708.80 - 713.52] would probably draw the line at 25 30
[711.84 - 715.84] like we saw happen with the danish
[713.52 - 718.08] footballer during the eriksen during the
[715.84 - 720.08] euro and also when recently one indian
[718.08 - 723.36] cricketer just collapsed
[720.08 - 725.52] those are cardiac arrests happening the
[723.36 - 727.44] press wrongly reports them as heart
[725.52 - 730.24] attack those are not because of
[727.44 - 732.24] cholesterol vp etc
[730.24 - 734.80] they are usually because of some
[732.24 - 738.08] abnormality in the structure of the
[734.80 - 741.44] heart often genetic in nature communists
[738.08 - 743.84] are what are called cardiomyopathies
[741.44 - 746.56] or some of the arteries are coming out
[743.84 - 750.00] of a wrong position it's called the
[746.56 - 751.12] anomalous origin of a coronary artery
[750.00 - 753.12] or
[751.12 - 754.80] many of them are unknown where the heart
[753.12 - 757.76] suddenly goes into what's called an
[754.80 - 759.84] arrhythmia an abnormal heart trigger so
[757.76 - 762.32] those lead directly to a heart attack
[759.84 - 764.80] sorry a cardiac arrest without a heart
[762.32 - 766.72] attack okay so so doc if somebody has
[764.80 - 768.56] like you said no family member or
[766.72 - 770.00] something or maybe they've done a
[768.56 - 772.24] genetic test and they figured out that
[770.00 - 774.80] they have the cardiomyopathy gene or the
[772.24 - 776.32] atrial fibrillation gene or these things
[774.80 - 779.60] that are being identified in today's
[776.32 - 781.68] world when they come and meet you
[779.60 - 784.08] what is what is it that you are looking
[781.68 - 786.48] for in such people and then what is the
[784.08 - 788.48] advice that you're giving them in terms
[786.48 - 790.32] of you know i think the biggest factor
[788.48 - 792.32] today is fear because we have all of
[790.32 - 794.40] this knowledge to test but then i think
[792.32 - 798.24] people bring upon the disease upon them
[794.40 - 800.16] by just manifesting a negative event
[798.24 - 804.00] so how do how do you comfort people how
[800.16 - 806.00] do you type you know in most of so let's
[804.00 - 808.16] first talk about the standard if i use
[806.00 - 810.08] the word standard heart disease which is
[808.16 - 811.92] the blockage you know the stuff that we
[810.08 - 814.08] most talk about technically called
[811.92 - 816.64] coronary artery disease that always
[814.08 - 818.16] benefits with exercise how much exercise
[816.64 - 819.92] at the right time is of course what we
[818.16 - 820.88] discuss with the client or with the
[819.92 - 822.40] patient
[820.88 - 824.72] now when you're talking about some of
[822.40 - 828.40] these cardiomyopathies
[824.72 - 830.88] um there are some if if we see that in
[828.40 - 833.92] in in the patient in the client
[830.88 - 835.36] rarely do we have to tell them to stop
[833.92 - 837.20] exercise
[835.36 - 839.84] we often need to tell them that they
[837.20 - 841.92] will have to stop competitive exercise
[839.84 - 845.44] at a at the highest level if they've got
[841.92 - 848.80] these cardiomyopathies but usually
[845.44 - 851.36] uh most can do regular recreational
[848.80 - 853.52] exercise so that's when the expertise
[851.36 - 856.64] comes in to decide who should do
[853.52 - 859.04] everything normally without any stock
[856.64 - 861.92] who should exercise recreationally but
[859.04 - 864.32] not competitively and which is that very
[861.92 - 866.32] small subset which should not do
[864.32 - 868.88] anything at all until further workout
[866.32 - 870.72] happens you know i'm smiling doc because
[868.88 - 872.56] i think the film stars go into a very
[870.72 - 873.68] competitive mode when they want to morph
[872.56 - 875.68] their body
[873.68 - 877.92] and they really aggressively push the
[875.68 - 879.52] body and then there's the diet which is
[877.92 - 881.60] restrictive
[879.52 - 884.08] and then you have various trainers or
[881.60 - 885.92] people giving advice don't drink water
[884.08 - 887.60] you know cut out on sodium so that your
[885.92 - 889.04] skin looks better for the movie shoot
[887.60 - 891.60] and i think this influences the rest of
[889.04 - 894.88] the population so you the point i think
[891.60 - 897.28] that i should rephrase is that
[894.88 - 899.84] check with a doctor on the intensity
[897.28 - 902.80] that you should work out at competitive
[899.84 - 904.16] or recreational fitness and to ask you
[902.80 - 906.40] another question
[904.16 - 908.16] would an exercise variable that tracks
[906.40 - 909.68] your heart rate help
[908.16 - 911.60] uh people
[909.68 - 913.60] work out in the correct heart training
[911.60 - 914.48] zone which puts lesser stress on the
[913.60 - 917.12] heart
[914.48 - 919.76] i i think so i think today variables
[917.12 - 922.24] have have really changed
[919.76 - 924.48] the face of the way we measure the way
[922.24 - 926.56] we quantify the human cell
[924.48 - 929.52] they need to be used sensibly now there
[926.56 - 931.84] are people who also then get drowned in
[929.52 - 934.40] data and get grounded numbers so that's
[931.84 - 936.64] the little care you need to take
[934.40 - 938.40] um that actually a fabulous company
[936.64 - 941.52] coincidentally based right out of your
[938.40 - 943.28] bank law called fox frontier and i've
[941.52 - 946.00] been using their devices they've got a
[943.28 - 949.36] heart rate strap called the frontier x
[946.00 - 952.72] which actually not only transmits the
[949.36 - 954.56] heart rate but it also transmits the ecg
[952.72 - 956.48] this is the first of its kind pretty
[954.56 - 958.00] much that i've seen in the world and
[956.48 - 961.20] i've been looking for years and years
[958.00 - 963.52] which transmits a live ecg and a very
[961.20 - 965.12] good quality ecg in the past whichever
[963.52 - 967.12] things that work with the ecg hasn't
[965.12 - 969.36] been that great so if you've got a
[967.12 - 971.20] specific heart condition then exercising
[969.36 - 973.20] with a device like this which measures
[971.20 - 975.12] the ecg is fantastic
[973.20 - 977.44] if you don't have a heart condition and
[975.12 - 979.92] you want to use heart rate training just
[977.44 - 981.52] to be more scientific than any wrist
[979.92 - 983.20] worn device
[981.52 - 985.12] or you know there are several today
[983.20 - 988.24] available and most have a reasonable
[985.12 - 989.60] degree of accuracy can be used the data
[988.24 - 991.92] needs to be used
[989.60 - 994.16] intelligently you need you need a right
[991.92 - 996.64] coach or right guidance as to what your
[994.16 - 998.48] heart rate guidelines should be and and
[996.64 - 1000.24] you've got also just make sure that you
[998.48 - 1001.84] don't get drowned in data often people
[1000.24 - 1003.44] get drowned in data and they forget the
[1001.84 - 1004.40] actual thing you just go out and do
[1003.44 - 1006.40] something
[1004.40 - 1008.96] wait for that perfect workout the
[1006.40 - 1010.96] perfect diet and in between they don't
[1008.96 - 1012.88] do anything so that that is a problem
[1010.96 - 1014.16] speaking of not doing anything i got one
[1012.88 - 1015.84] or two more questions before i let you
[1014.16 - 1017.76] go i know you have a busy day
[1015.84 - 1019.68] take your time what prompted you to
[1017.76 - 1021.36] write this book the heart truth and i'm
[1019.68 - 1024.08] going to put the link up for people to
[1021.36 - 1026.72] buy because when i read that book it
[1024.08 - 1029.76] gave me an eye opener uh because i did
[1026.72 - 1031.92] my genetic testing and i've got like 60
[1029.76 - 1033.44] of the indians according to the gene lab
[1031.92 - 1037.12] 60 of the indians have the
[1033.44 - 1039.36] predisposition to heart disease yeah so
[1037.12 - 1041.20] um i i was reading your book and you
[1039.36 - 1042.40] talked about the perfect weight is
[1041.20 - 1044.00] important
[1042.40 - 1045.52] if you look at a person and i'm being
[1044.00 - 1047.36] very cheeky over here you must be seeing
[1045.52 - 1049.12] thousands of patients right so somebody
[1047.36 - 1050.64] comes in and just looking at i think
[1049.12 - 1051.60] this guy is a probable heart attack
[1050.64 - 1053.76] person
[1051.60 - 1056.56] ah looks deceiving like you see a fat
[1053.76 - 1059.12] man with a visceral fat belly uh what's
[1056.56 - 1061.20] your experience from an eye perspective
[1059.12 - 1063.52] to catch a person or you're at a party i
[1061.20 - 1065.20] invite you to my next year's newer party
[1063.52 - 1066.72] and we have 500 people over there and
[1065.20 - 1068.32] ash's contract because heart attack no
[1066.72 - 1070.48] heart attack heart attack no harder is
[1068.32 - 1071.92] it possible that way
[1070.48 - 1073.60] okay so you're asking two separate
[1071.92 - 1076.40] questions i'll answer them one after the
[1073.60 - 1079.04] other in terms of you know can you judge
[1076.40 - 1081.20] a book by its cover
[1079.04 - 1082.96] in my practice i've learned that you can
[1081.20 - 1086.08] often be wrong
[1082.96 - 1089.20] we gen we normally go by this thing that
[1086.08 - 1091.20] thing is fit and fat is unfit
[1089.20 - 1093.28] which is not true of course if you took
[1091.20 - 1095.84] a room of 100 people and you divided
[1093.28 - 1098.40] them by pmi usually the ones who have
[1095.84 - 1099.84] the healthy bmi will as a group be
[1098.40 - 1102.32] healthier than the ones who are an
[1099.84 - 1105.20] unhealthy bmi but there's a huge
[1102.32 - 1106.56] variation within that range i have found
[1105.20 - 1107.84] that there are a lot of people who
[1106.56 - 1111.36] overweight i'm not talking about
[1107.84 - 1114.24] completely obese say bmi 25 to 13 that
[1111.36 - 1117.28] zone but who exercise regularly they are
[1114.24 - 1119.20] metabolically fit their sugars their
[1117.28 - 1121.20] cholesterol
[1119.20 - 1122.64] all their numbers are in great order
[1121.20 - 1124.32] it's just that they're carrying a few
[1122.64 - 1126.64] extra kilos they're trying their best
[1124.32 - 1128.32] they're even maybe eating healthy but
[1126.64 - 1130.00] but you know what they're still walking
[1128.32 - 1132.64] around with some weight and then there
[1130.00 - 1134.48] are people who look very thin but just
[1132.64 - 1137.36] because they're thin doesn't mean that
[1134.48 - 1140.08] their numbers are perfectly in order so
[1137.36 - 1141.92] i i may not know just by looking at them
[1140.08 - 1143.84] but by maybe observing them for half an
[1141.92 - 1145.44] hour and looking at their plate i might
[1143.84 - 1148.32] get a little more
[1145.44 - 1150.24] inkling but but i've been horribly wrong
[1148.32 - 1152.24] several times so i don't even want to go
[1150.24 - 1154.24] there swathambri do you have any
[1152.24 - 1155.84] questions for doctor
[1154.24 - 1158.08] well i think the question that i've been
[1155.84 - 1160.24] getting in the recent past owing to all
[1158.08 - 1162.64] those incidents of heart attacks uh
[1160.24 - 1164.72] doctor is really about over training and
[1162.64 - 1167.28] i just quickly wanted to uh you know ask
[1164.72 - 1170.32] you this question you know how what is
[1167.28 - 1172.16] overtraining in a sense we say that you
[1170.32 - 1174.56] should work out anything between 30 to
[1172.16 - 1176.16] you know 50 minutes max an hour a day
[1174.56 - 1178.40] and then be active through the day and
[1176.16 - 1181.36] not just you know be sitting around
[1178.40 - 1184.48] but i've seen a lot of the ones like
[1181.36 - 1186.72] between the age of 30 and 40 or 25 to 35
[1184.48 - 1188.64] sometimes do like two hours three hours
[1186.72 - 1190.32] of rigorous training and i think at a
[1188.64 - 1192.96] slightly younger age you may not feel
[1190.32 - 1196.24] the burnout as much but
[1192.96 - 1198.56] do can i relate that to uh eventually
[1196.24 - 1201.68] not being good for the heart
[1198.56 - 1204.16] okay so you asked asked a great question
[1201.68 - 1205.84] uh let me quickly answer ryan's earlier
[1204.16 - 1206.72] question what prompted me to write the
[1205.84 - 1207.44] book
[1206.72 - 1210.56] so
[1207.44 - 1211.84] in my in my cardiac rehab practice we
[1210.56 - 1213.76] used to see
[1211.84 - 1215.68] you know i must have seen over over 10
[1213.76 - 1219.12] 000 people come and go
[1215.68 - 1220.80] and i decided that a lot of people they
[1219.12 - 1223.60] have hundreds of questions but the
[1220.80 - 1225.28] questions tend to be very similar so i
[1223.60 - 1227.84] wrote the book in a very colloquial
[1225.28 - 1229.28] fashion these are my experiences of
[1227.84 - 1230.88] dealing with my patients and they
[1229.28 - 1234.24] usually have the same questions so i'll
[1230.88 - 1236.48] try to in a conversational style address
[1234.24 - 1238.88] about four five hundred of the communist
[1236.48 - 1240.88] questions that that they've had
[1238.88 - 1242.56] over time and i found that that was very
[1240.88 - 1244.00] useful so now when people come and i say
[1242.56 - 1245.84] if you like you can read the book that
[1244.00 - 1247.76] will answer a lot of the questions um
[1245.84 - 1249.84] that you have and it was i promised
[1247.76 - 1252.72] myself before i turn 40 i will write a
[1249.84 - 1255.60] book so that's uh that was the reason
[1252.72 - 1257.36] for the book and i'll run a sub 145 half
[1255.60 - 1259.92] marathon so both those promises have
[1257.36 - 1261.20] been kept and that was exactly 10 years
[1259.92 - 1264.56] ago
[1261.20 - 1267.20] um to answer sritambri's question okay
[1264.56 - 1270.40] this question of over exercising and
[1267.20 - 1272.16] over training is a great question let's
[1270.40 - 1274.96] look at it in two ways
[1272.16 - 1277.20] we can do what's called acute or chronic
[1274.96 - 1279.68] acute means over exercising like in a
[1277.20 - 1281.68] single session right a session of last
[1279.68 - 1284.40] three hours how much you go right
[1281.68 - 1286.80] that's a immediate acute overtrain the
[1284.40 - 1289.92] second is chronic chronic meaning over
[1286.80 - 1293.20] months over years someone who's running
[1289.92 - 1295.36] 100 kilometers plus week after week for
[1293.20 - 1297.28] you know many years um someone who
[1295.36 - 1300.24] trains in the gym two hours a day for
[1297.28 - 1302.32] you know week after week year after year
[1300.24 - 1305.44] um
[1302.32 - 1308.24] so if someone builds up them
[1305.44 - 1311.52] builds themselves up sensibly right
[1308.24 - 1314.16] starting with the very standard 30 to 60
[1311.52 - 1315.92] minutes moderate intensity exercise four
[1314.16 - 1318.08] five days a week
[1315.92 - 1320.40] um and you keep building up rule of
[1318.08 - 1322.80] thumb is not doing more than 10
[1320.40 - 1325.36] increment over your previous week
[1322.80 - 1329.60] if you do that over time
[1325.36 - 1331.36] a person the human body is capable of
[1329.60 - 1333.60] great achievement
[1331.36 - 1335.52] okay i used to once growing up think
[1333.60 - 1337.76] that oh my god 42 kilometers is
[1335.52 - 1339.60] impossible for the last now seven years
[1337.76 - 1342.96] i've been doing one full marathon every
[1339.60 - 1346.00] year but the human body can build it up
[1342.96 - 1348.16] so that isn't a problem but if i wake up
[1346.00 - 1349.92] a lot of people are the weekend warriors
[1348.16 - 1351.68] they're not doing much and then suddenly
[1349.92 - 1354.24] on a sunday they decide today we'll go
[1351.68 - 1357.04] and write for four hours today we will
[1354.24 - 1358.40] you know run for two hours that
[1357.04 - 1360.48] is a problem
[1358.40 - 1363.20] okay so when you push yourself
[1360.48 - 1364.80] so over training is
[1363.20 - 1368.80] pushing
[1364.80 - 1370.40] an unprepared body for the task at hand
[1368.80 - 1373.52] that's very important there are two
[1370.40 - 1375.44] people somebody may run one and a half
[1373.52 - 1376.88] hours and that may be over training
[1375.44 - 1378.56] because that person's never run more
[1376.88 - 1380.72] than half an hour before in their life
[1378.56 - 1382.24] or someone may run four hours but
[1380.72 - 1383.68] they've been doing between three and
[1382.24 - 1386.24] three and a half hours for the last six
[1383.68 - 1388.88] months so for that person that four hour
[1386.24 - 1390.72] run wasn't over training to the position
[1388.88 - 1392.64] they had built themselves up with but
[1390.72 - 1394.24] the guy who ran one and a half hours was
[1392.64 - 1396.40] used to half an hour over training why
[1394.24 - 1398.48] the guy who ran 45 minutes when he's
[1396.40 - 1401.04] never run before is over training
[1398.48 - 1403.76] okay so acute over training has got to
[1401.04 - 1406.56] be seen in light of the conditioning of
[1403.76 - 1408.08] the person okay that's important chronic
[1406.56 - 1410.16] over training this is where it gets
[1408.08 - 1412.72] interesting is there something like too
[1410.16 - 1414.72] much over time so earlier the answer was
[1412.72 - 1416.56] there really isn't too much
[1414.72 - 1418.88] what they've now discovered that people
[1416.56 - 1422.32] who are putting in large volumes of
[1418.88 - 1424.48] endurance training over many years they
[1422.32 - 1426.80] sometimes tend to have higher amounts of
[1424.48 - 1428.80] what's called atrial fibrillation they
[1426.80 - 1432.08] sometimes have a little more scarring on
[1428.80 - 1434.80] the heart muscle having said that we've
[1432.08 - 1437.52] still not figured that is that
[1434.80 - 1440.56] more dangerous in any way so the jury is
[1437.52 - 1443.28] out there that is there something like
[1440.56 - 1445.60] the ill effects of chronic over training
[1443.28 - 1448.00] number one and if there is what's the
[1445.60 - 1450.72] magic plan now please let me emphasize
[1448.00 - 1454.00] these are people who have been doing
[1450.72 - 1456.16] like on an average 40 50 70 full
[1454.00 - 1458.64] marathons ultra marathon so by no means
[1456.16 - 1460.08] the average person that you and i see in
[1458.64 - 1463.12] our practice so there's no need for
[1460.08 - 1465.68] people to panic but there is off late
[1463.12 - 1467.76] last five seven years scientific light
[1465.68 - 1470.24] looking at this okay so that question is
[1467.76 - 1471.36] under study as of now we haven't defined
[1470.24 - 1472.48] that
[1471.36 - 1475.04] sure
[1472.48 - 1475.04] thanks doc
[1480.80 - 1487.12] sorry uh here there's a question from a
[1484.32 - 1489.60] person watching us mr patel asking with
[1487.12 - 1492.32] relationship to triglycerides
[1489.60 - 1496.00] even after a safe diet no outside food
[1492.32 - 1498.80] and exercise still my triglycerides
[1496.00 - 1502.64] visceral fat levels often shoot up what
[1498.80 - 1504.72] may be the reason okay so um you know
[1502.64 - 1506.88] the diet part i'll leave to you but just
[1504.72 - 1508.56] one quick point just because you don't
[1506.88 - 1510.40] eat outside food that doesn't
[1508.56 - 1511.92] necessarily mean that you're treating
[1510.40 - 1513.76] healthy food right
[1511.92 - 1516.64] the average indian diet especially the
[1513.76 - 1519.68] vegetarian diet tends to be very high in
[1516.64 - 1521.68] carbohydrate uh and i'm not an anti-carb
[1519.68 - 1523.92] person like the fad is today but the
[1521.68 - 1526.24] point is the average indian diet tends
[1523.92 - 1527.44] to be very high in simple sugars just a
[1526.24 - 1530.64] lot of
[1527.44 - 1532.80] rice bread chapatis in the diet as
[1530.64 - 1535.20] opposed to vegetables so though you know
[1532.80 - 1537.36] the person may be vegetarian the amount
[1535.20 - 1539.76] of vegetables which is great for you is
[1537.36 - 1541.44] not eaten in large quantities in my
[1539.76 - 1544.08] experience indians tend to have high
[1541.44 - 1546.00] triglycerides and low hdl along with
[1544.08 - 1548.24] that visceral fat is that classic
[1546.00 - 1550.48] insulin resistance syndrome metabolic
[1548.24 - 1552.32] syndrome syndrome x which i'm sure
[1550.48 - 1553.92] you're very familiar with
[1552.32 - 1556.08] um
[1553.92 - 1558.32] i have found that reducing the simple
[1556.08 - 1559.84] carbohydrates simple sugars in the diet
[1558.32 - 1562.64] definitely helps
[1559.84 - 1564.80] um exercise helps reducing visceral fat
[1562.64 - 1566.64] and triglycerides i think i think if
[1564.80 - 1569.44] you're consistent
[1566.64 - 1571.92] over time you will definitely get
[1569.44 - 1574.08] benefits uh in reducing triangular
[1571.92 - 1576.32] strides with a little bit of weight loss
[1574.08 - 1578.40] regular not just exercise as the doubly
[1576.32 - 1580.32] said also including physical activity is
[1578.40 - 1581.68] part of your daily life okay there are
[1580.32 - 1583.68] people who go to the gym one hour a day
[1581.68 - 1586.88] and spencer's being inactive so that's
[1583.68 - 1588.32] also not true so being physically active
[1586.88 - 1590.64] exercising
[1588.32 - 1592.72] uh reducing simple sugars in the diet
[1590.64 - 1595.44] all of these will go towards reducing
[1592.72 - 1597.76] triglycerides and visceral fat as well
[1595.44 - 1599.12] wonderful doc i think we have taken more
[1597.76 - 1601.36] than time that you have taken you are
[1599.12 - 1602.96] required back at the hospital thank you
[1601.36 - 1606.40] for joining us today and a million
[1602.96 - 1607.76] million thanks wonderful happy new year
[1606.40 - 1610.56] thank you doctor
[1607.76 - 1613.76] bye thank you doc thank you
[1610.56 - 1614.88] so shui we had dr ashish contractor and
[1613.76 - 1616.80] um
[1614.88 - 1618.56] i guess if i've never run a marathon and
[1616.80 - 1619.84] he's run a marathon and he was saying if
[1618.56 - 1621.68] somebody suddenly decides to run a
[1619.84 - 1624.40] marathon never run in their life that's
[1621.68 - 1625.68] me that's me ryan fernando i run on my
[1624.40 - 1628.16] treadmill
[1625.68 - 1630.24] i do i do 11 or 12 on the treadmill for
[1628.16 - 1632.32] 30 seconds and then i walk for about 20
[1630.24 - 1634.64] minutes and then i sprint again
[1632.32 - 1637.44] but today's session is all about
[1634.64 - 1639.36] the people who we have to convince way
[1637.44 - 1641.76] to dance you are
[1639.36 - 1643.60] a dance instructor you are a physical
[1641.76 - 1645.04] fitness trainer you are a crossfit
[1643.60 - 1646.80] athlete
[1645.04 - 1648.16] if somebody came up to you shui and
[1646.80 - 1650.32] asked you
[1648.16 - 1651.20] where do i start
[1650.32 - 1653.36] or
[1651.20 - 1655.92] they start and everyone makes this new
[1653.36 - 1657.92] year's resolution and they fail within
[1655.92 - 1660.64] 20-25 days
[1657.92 - 1662.32] what would be your advice start big and
[1660.64 - 1664.72] push your body because i see this happen
[1662.32 - 1667.36] in the gym trainers get enthusias
[1664.72 - 1669.28] enthusiastic people get enthusiastic but
[1667.36 - 1671.36] by february most of the crowd that has
[1669.28 - 1672.56] joined us has disappeared you just have
[1671.36 - 1674.40] the regulars
[1672.56 - 1676.16] so what's what's your advice you've gone
[1674.40 - 1678.32] through many new years and what would
[1676.16 - 1680.88] you advise yeah
[1678.32 - 1683.60] for anyone and everyone like
[1680.88 - 1686.32] irrespective of what age they belong to
[1683.60 - 1688.48] right i think the fundamental will
[1686.32 - 1692.00] always be the same
[1688.48 - 1694.96] first learn to get your body moving
[1692.00 - 1697.68] right and only then incorporate other
[1694.96 - 1699.52] types of activities and when i say learn
[1697.68 - 1703.04] to you know get your body moving i just
[1699.52 - 1705.12] say start with walking a lot more often
[1703.04 - 1707.76] that is your fundamental your body is
[1705.12 - 1711.52] designed to move and if you're not able
[1707.76 - 1714.08] to walk enough steps in a given day then
[1711.52 - 1716.88] maybe incorporating other activities i'm
[1714.08 - 1720.08] not saying is wrong but maybe it'll be
[1716.88 - 1722.16] too soon yes you can start off with yoga
[1720.08 - 1724.08] you can start off with pilates you can
[1722.16 - 1726.32] start with you know just a little bit of
[1724.08 - 1728.32] jogging running dancing especially for
[1726.32 - 1730.48] people who love music and dance all of
[1728.32 - 1733.84] this is great just 20 minutes 30 minutes
[1730.48 - 1736.00] a day but the most fundamental is moving
[1733.84 - 1737.60] your body more often so my
[1736.00 - 1740.88] recommendation to everyone is start
[1737.60 - 1742.40] moving uh if you are doing 2500 steps a
[1740.88 - 1744.56] day because you have a set entry
[1742.40 - 1746.48] lifestyle you're working a lot of hours
[1744.56 - 1750.00] sitting in front of the laptop step it
[1746.48 - 1752.00] up to maybe 3500 start slow or maybe 5
[1750.00 - 1754.16] 000 and then slowly over weeks you'll
[1752.00 - 1756.16] see you're able to push it to six
[1754.16 - 1759.20] thousand seven thousand right start with
[1756.16 - 1762.88] that but otherwise apart from moving and
[1759.20 - 1766.08] walking uh my go-to is always 20 to 30
[1762.88 - 1768.24] minutes of activity and choose your
[1766.08 - 1769.84] favorite activity that's the second
[1768.24 - 1772.72] important thing when you choose your
[1769.84 - 1774.48] favorite activity you will be consistent
[1772.72 - 1776.88] and then when you're consistent after
[1774.48 - 1779.04] like a month or so you will see results
[1776.88 - 1781.20] and when you see results you're excited
[1779.04 - 1783.60] to continue that journey and then that
[1781.20 - 1785.04] 20 30 minutes will become 40 minutes 50
[1783.60 - 1787.52] minutes you know you end up spending a
[1785.04 - 1789.92] lot more time and i have a lot of these
[1787.52 - 1790.64] examples people who test exercising you
[1789.92 - 1793.44] know
[1790.64 - 1796.24] we convince them to just do 15 minutes a
[1793.44 - 1798.08] day not asking even a minute more right
[1796.24 - 1799.76] and today uh you know this group of
[1798.08 - 1802.00] people who started with 15 minutes do
[1799.76 - 1804.08] like 45 50 minutes and
[1802.00 - 1806.88] literally change their body composition
[1804.08 - 1809.12] you know become leaner stronger
[1806.88 - 1811.44] far lower fat percentage so on and so
[1809.12 - 1813.84] forth so pick an activity that you love
[1811.44 - 1815.44] doing and it can be absolutely anything
[1813.84 - 1817.76] it can be a sport
[1815.44 - 1819.36] right i do not say that sport and
[1817.76 - 1822.16] exercises are too similar things but
[1819.36 - 1824.24] both let you move right even sports is
[1822.16 - 1825.52] fun a lot of us love sports and you know
[1824.24 - 1827.60] we don't do too much sports because we
[1825.52 - 1829.44] don't have time but pick a spot you love
[1827.60 - 1831.60] pick any activity that you can do
[1829.44 - 1833.92] consistently for a month or pick a
[1831.60 - 1835.68] trainer so there are very space ryan if
[1833.92 - 1837.76] one wants to really start a personal
[1835.68 - 1840.96] trainer can do wonders you have been
[1837.76 - 1842.48] personal training for years now yeah
[1840.96 - 1843.92] that's a point i'm sorry i'm
[1842.48 - 1846.16] interrupting you but this is a point i
[1843.92 - 1849.12] think for all our listeners to listen in
[1846.16 - 1852.40] for the fitness industry uh people feel
[1849.12 - 1855.44] that if i invest money in a trainer
[1852.40 - 1857.52] uh it's it's going to be expensive like
[1855.44 - 1859.28] most gym memberships in india around 12
[1857.52 - 1860.88] 000 rupees a thousand rupees a month on
[1859.28 - 1863.20] an average if you go to a high class gym
[1860.88 - 1864.80] maybe it's 2000 rupees a month so people
[1863.20 - 1866.96] think oh i'm spending two thousand
[1864.80 - 1869.04] rupees a month for the gym or the
[1866.96 - 1871.68] exercise or the coach or the yoga
[1869.04 - 1873.76] instructor but the personal training
[1871.68 - 1876.96] cost is let's say anywhere starting from
[1873.76 - 1879.44] 5 000 to 40 000 rupees a month
[1876.96 - 1881.12] right uh and let me share my experience
[1879.44 - 1884.08] i've been personal training for now 10
[1881.12 - 1885.76] years with a personal trainer and i had
[1884.08 - 1887.36] the same um
[1885.76 - 1889.44] i had the same fundamental principle
[1887.36 - 1891.92] that i'm going to be spending you know
[1889.44 - 1894.00] five eight thousand rupees a month and
[1891.92 - 1895.60] those days it used to be the emi of my
[1894.00 - 1896.48] car
[1895.60 - 1900.32] right
[1896.48 - 1902.88] now my uh input to everyone uh out there
[1900.32 - 1905.04] listening in today is that
[1902.88 - 1907.60] whilst you can change your car
[1905.04 - 1908.32] you can't change your body
[1907.60 - 1910.00] so
[1908.32 - 1913.52] your investment with your trainer which
[1910.00 - 1916.32] is a post i put up yesterday um
[1913.52 - 1919.44] i have i had mr vishnupai who recruited
[1916.32 - 1922.24] a personal trainer at the age of 72.
[1919.44 - 1924.24] with one year of personal training his
[1922.24 - 1925.68] metabolic age he was 72 birth
[1924.24 - 1928.64] certificate
[1925.68 - 1930.72] and 73 metabolic his body age came down
[1928.64 - 1933.52] to 60.
[1930.72 - 1935.76] 13 years of metabolic age down because
[1933.52 - 1937.44] he lost about 11 kgs of only fat and
[1935.76 - 1939.68] retained all his muscle because of the
[1937.44 - 1941.44] personal trainer so at 72 the personal
[1939.68 - 1944.24] trainer didn't allow him to go over or
[1941.44 - 1945.76] extra now mr vishnupay earns about one
[1944.24 - 1947.20] cr per year
[1945.76 - 1949.04] one crore a year
[1947.20 - 1951.84] so that personal trainer just gave him
[1949.04 - 1953.68] 13 crores more of additional income
[1951.84 - 1957.12] so if you begin to look
[1953.68 - 1959.84] at your investment in exercise start
[1957.12 - 1961.76] with the thought to work out
[1959.84 - 1963.12] then start with the thought to do an
[1961.76 - 1966.24] activity
[1963.12 - 1968.80] then go to a place to do that activity
[1966.24 - 1971.04] then engage with a person or friends and
[1968.80 - 1973.28] speaking of french way
[1971.04 - 1976.00] do you think when people join together
[1973.28 - 1978.00] as friends or a group of people there's
[1976.00 - 1980.48] more chance of success of them
[1978.00 - 1982.08] continuing in in the year
[1980.48 - 1984.32] yeah 100
[1982.08 - 1987.12] we've noticed even at cult right group
[1984.32 - 1988.64] workouts are far more successful or a
[1987.12 - 1991.12] partner workout like you do with your
[1988.64 - 1993.36] personal trainer right are far far more
[1991.12 - 1995.76] successful because uh people feel
[1993.36 - 1998.72] accountable like even when i work with
[1995.76 - 2001.12] one trainer as a group exercise i've
[1998.72 - 2002.80] built a community or a family you know
[2001.12 - 2004.80] who actually check on me when i don't
[2002.80 - 2007.04] show up consecutively for two three days
[2004.80 - 2009.52] hey you know why haven't you been coming
[2007.04 - 2012.40] so yes the number of people who are
[2009.52 - 2014.80] become consistent are far more when they
[2012.40 - 2017.60] work out as a buddy or as a personal
[2014.80 - 2020.56] trainer or as a group definitely
[2017.60 - 2022.40] what's the best
[2020.56 - 2024.96] that you've seen from a couch potato
[2022.40 - 2028.00] joining an exercise program and what's
[2024.96 - 2028.00] the worst you've seen
[2028.80 - 2032.64] what's the best so
[2030.80 - 2035.04] you know uh
[2032.64 - 2036.80] i think from a couch for a couch potato
[2035.04 - 2039.20] or for someone who's got very sedentary
[2036.80 - 2042.32] lifestyle uh well i've seen how they
[2039.20 - 2044.96] just jump into exercise or let's say we
[2042.32 - 2047.60] open in new new cities every year right
[2044.96 - 2049.52] or every other month at least we were
[2047.60 - 2051.12] so people would really get excited about
[2049.52 - 2053.84] oh cult is in our city and they would
[2051.12 - 2055.60] like all come in for that first class a
[2053.84 - 2057.76] lot of these guys who've never probably
[2055.60 - 2061.20] exercised before right in front of my
[2057.76 - 2062.64] eyes i've seen people just like drop
[2061.20 - 2063.60] you know like 20 minutes into the
[2062.64 - 2065.60] workout
[2063.60 - 2066.48] they just drop they're sweating and they
[2065.60 - 2067.76] drop
[2066.48 - 2070.96] not because of anything else because
[2067.76 - 2072.96] their body is not used to it right and
[2070.96 - 2075.44] then what what i typically do is i keep
[2072.96 - 2077.60] like a candy and i immediately give them
[2075.44 - 2080.56] a candy and then they then like feeling
[2077.60 - 2082.72] a little better you know so this is like
[2080.56 - 2085.44] the worst because nobody has educated
[2082.72 - 2088.32] them exactly how that transition should
[2085.44 - 2091.04] be how to start slow and moderate and
[2088.32 - 2093.44] then go to that advanced level right but
[2091.04 - 2094.88] people normally who start off with like
[2093.44 - 2097.76] you know listen to the trainer do
[2094.88 - 2100.00] shorter duration of workouts um and
[2097.76 - 2102.32] probably like i said again do you get do
[2100.00 - 2104.80] you get this statement i was an athlete
[2102.32 - 2106.40] in college i am now 47 years old but i
[2104.80 - 2110.72] was an athlete in college do you get
[2106.40 - 2110.72] that statement yeah from my father
[2110.88 - 2114.48] i mean fortunately baby i i have to
[2113.12 - 2115.68] listen to him because he's a super
[2114.48 - 2117.20] active man
[2115.68 - 2119.52] except what happened recently but
[2117.20 - 2121.60] otherwise he's been active all his life
[2119.52 - 2124.32] and the only reason he's able to survive
[2121.60 - 2125.52] his diabetes that stent in his heart and
[2124.32 - 2128.48] all of that
[2125.52 - 2131.28] is because of his activity every day two
[2128.48 - 2134.16] hours of consistent you know walking and
[2131.28 - 2136.32] basic exercise never a day not even a
[2134.16 - 2138.00] sunday he believes in not waking up in
[2136.32 - 2140.88] the morning and doing it so
[2138.00 - 2142.24] yeah once an athlete always an athlete i
[2140.88 - 2143.92] guess but
[2142.24 - 2146.00] we kind of lose those years because
[2143.92 - 2147.12] we're also caught up with life and
[2146.00 - 2149.20] profession
[2147.12 - 2150.96] but it's really not hard ryan for any of
[2149.20 - 2152.48] us to just be active i keep telling
[2150.96 - 2154.48] people that even if you don't go and
[2152.48 - 2156.64] exercise it's okay
[2154.48 - 2159.12] if you can get up every five minutes
[2156.64 - 2160.80] every hour for five minutes every hour
[2159.12 - 2162.88] walk around just around your room or
[2160.80 - 2164.80] something you're sorted right just
[2162.88 - 2166.80] moving your body more often is what we
[2164.80 - 2169.12] really need
[2166.80 - 2172.80] i think we have two questions here yes
[2169.12 - 2173.84] so one question is uh what is genetic
[2172.80 - 2176.96] testing
[2173.84 - 2178.72] so uh jyothi asked this question so in
[2176.96 - 2181.60] the new age world when we work with
[2178.72 - 2184.72] elite athletes we work with celebrities
[2181.60 - 2186.88] um i am at kua nutrition clinics doing
[2184.72 - 2188.88] what is known as nutrigenomics
[2186.88 - 2190.56] neutrogenomics is the science of taking
[2188.88 - 2193.04] a saliva sample
[2190.56 - 2196.32] opening up your dna dna is a software
[2193.04 - 2198.32] code in the human body and a certain lab
[2196.32 - 2200.72] will do the checking of that software
[2198.32 - 2202.00] code so they can check for what they can
[2200.72 - 2203.04] check for the color of your eyes they
[2202.00 - 2204.88] can check whether they're going to go
[2203.04 - 2205.92] bald they're going to they can even
[2204.88 - 2206.72] check whether you're going to have a
[2205.92 - 2209.12] heart
[2206.72 - 2211.12] attack risk and there are huge things
[2209.12 - 2212.24] from the diet point of view like for
[2211.12 - 2215.20] example
[2212.24 - 2217.68] i checked for gluten sensitivity
[2215.20 - 2218.88] now my dna says that i'm gluten
[2217.68 - 2220.24] sensitive
[2218.88 - 2223.28] but my
[2220.24 - 2224.64] gut does not say i'm gluten sensitive
[2223.28 - 2225.92] and this is something very interesting
[2224.64 - 2227.28] that i want to share with people about
[2225.92 - 2229.52] gene testing
[2227.28 - 2232.40] we have recently started a cardiac
[2229.52 - 2235.36] dietary rehabilitation division
[2232.40 - 2237.20] so we are helping shwathambri thousands
[2235.36 - 2238.96] of people who have high cholesterol as
[2237.20 - 2240.64] dr ashish said
[2238.96 - 2243.60] people have high lipoprotein a
[2240.64 - 2245.44] lipoprotein b homocysteine c reactive
[2243.60 - 2248.88] protein these are all inflammatory
[2245.44 - 2250.88] markers with your cholesterol and your
[2248.88 - 2252.00] diabetes which is hbo and see if it's
[2250.88 - 2254.64] high
[2252.00 - 2258.16] so such people are more susceptible
[2254.64 - 2259.60] to metabolic disease and incidences of
[2258.16 - 2262.32] heart disease
[2259.60 - 2264.24] so when we do a genetic test you get a
[2262.32 - 2265.68] crystal ball gazing i'm like an
[2264.24 - 2267.60] astrologer
[2265.68 - 2269.60] that's saying there's a chance that in
[2267.60 - 2272.32] the future you may have an issue why
[2269.60 - 2274.24] don't you keep this uh rudraksha so this
[2272.32 - 2275.68] rosary or this uh
[2274.24 - 2278.32] you know these beads with you and start
[2275.68 - 2280.40] praying but for me those beads and all
[2278.32 - 2282.64] are all related to your nutrition from
[2280.40 - 2286.00] your perspective your beads are all
[2282.64 - 2289.44] about exercise so genetic testing is
[2286.00 - 2291.68] doing a dna analysis and seeing do you
[2289.44 - 2292.88] have a gene that says it's thumbs up in
[2291.68 - 2296.00] your body
[2292.88 - 2298.16] 50 50 or thumbs down very interestingly
[2296.00 - 2300.72] i am gluten intolerant for the last
[2298.16 - 2302.96] eight years i gave up bread wheat
[2300.72 - 2305.04] biscuits pastry so i only buy gluten
[2302.96 - 2306.16] free stuff which is from wheat barley
[2305.04 - 2308.24] and rye
[2306.16 - 2310.08] and last week when we launched the
[2308.24 - 2312.08] cardiac rehab division schwa thumbery
[2310.08 - 2314.48] this is a very interesting
[2312.08 - 2316.80] we found a study
[2314.48 - 2318.88] that had rats because rats have about a
[2316.80 - 2321.04] 98 genetic
[2318.88 - 2322.80] profile to us and it has a short shelf
[2321.04 - 2324.64] life so you can do multiple generations
[2322.80 - 2327.12] of that so they
[2324.64 - 2328.80] they caused plaque
[2327.12 - 2331.60] to form in the rats by feeding them a
[2328.80 - 2332.48] very high fat diet
[2331.60 - 2334.32] okay
[2332.48 - 2336.24] and then they divided them into two
[2334.32 - 2339.12] groups in one group of rats they gave
[2336.24 - 2340.72] them gluten which is found in wheat
[2339.12 - 2342.24] and in one group they gave them no
[2340.72 - 2344.56] gluten
[2342.24 - 2346.32] and they found that the plaque
[2344.56 - 2348.48] which is those blockages in the artery
[2346.32 - 2351.76] were much more stickier
[2348.48 - 2353.36] in the rats who were on a gluten-based
[2351.76 - 2356.24] diet that is wheat was there in their
[2353.36 - 2358.48] diet and the diet that did not have the
[2356.24 - 2361.60] wheat which did not have the gluten
[2358.48 - 2363.52] those rats had nearly 60 percent lesser
[2361.60 - 2365.84] incidences of
[2363.52 - 2368.24] black formation which led to sudden
[2365.84 - 2370.80] deaths in the rats even rats get heart
[2368.24 - 2373.28] attacks unfortunately so the perspective
[2370.80 - 2375.36] over here for me was i could do a dna
[2373.28 - 2377.92] test which got nothing related to my
[2375.36 - 2379.76] heart from a nutrition point of view and
[2377.92 - 2383.20] figure out whether i should or should
[2379.76 - 2384.96] not avoid so i call this a light living
[2383.20 - 2387.76] wherein when you when i come to your gym
[2384.96 - 2389.52] shui i'm buying a lovely pair of shoes
[2387.76 - 2392.24] whereas we could always work out
[2389.52 - 2393.68] barefoot so the fashionability the
[2392.24 - 2395.20] knowledge is to wear something that's
[2393.68 - 2397.60] fashionable but people don't understand
[2395.20 - 2399.20] the fashion is actually science
[2397.60 - 2400.88] and in nutrition the fashionability
[2399.20 - 2402.96] could be to check your genetics to
[2400.88 - 2405.20] figure out what it is that can work
[2402.96 - 2406.48] another one is a caffeine gene
[2405.20 - 2408.00] do you remember your caffeine gene
[2406.48 - 2410.24] should you drink coffee should you not
[2408.00 - 2412.16] drink coffee no so my genetic test says
[2410.24 - 2414.00] i should not be drinking coffee in fact
[2412.16 - 2415.68] my gut test also said
[2414.00 - 2416.96] kind of say no to coffee but i love
[2415.68 - 2419.36] coffee and i remember our last
[2416.96 - 2421.92] conversation you said uh let me see how
[2419.36 - 2423.20] i can give you that one coffee yeah so
[2421.92 - 2425.36] so when i'm doing your nutrition
[2423.20 - 2427.60] counseling here's the perspective
[2425.36 - 2430.88] research has shown people who are not
[2427.60 - 2433.44] caffeine responders as per their dna
[2430.88 - 2436.24] should take only one cup of coffee a day
[2433.44 - 2439.44] anything more raises your blood pressure
[2436.24 - 2441.76] and increases your risk element of heart
[2439.44 - 2443.28] attack or stroke
[2441.76 - 2445.28] so it's a very very interesting thing
[2443.28 - 2447.52] that you're very fit and everything i'm
[2445.28 - 2449.68] only operating from a perspective that i
[2447.52 - 2451.44] have to always convince you that you
[2449.68 - 2454.64] know maybe just one cup of coffee would
[2451.44 - 2457.20] be good enough not more than that
[2454.64 - 2459.20] cool we haven't i think i think i i must
[2457.20 - 2461.28] add here something else that i wanted to
[2459.20 - 2463.60] talk to you about the genetic this was
[2461.28 - 2465.12] it my genetic test also shows the fact
[2463.60 - 2467.60] that uh
[2465.12 - 2470.24] my fat loss doesn't necessarily always
[2467.60 - 2472.88] come from just exercise right because i
[2470.24 - 2476.56] exercise a lot and not a lot but very
[2472.88 - 2477.52] consistently and i do see a lot of gains
[2476.56 - 2479.68] from it
[2477.52 - 2482.16] but i keep going back to ryan because i
[2479.68 - 2484.56] know through my genetic test that just
[2482.16 - 2485.68] by exercising i'm not going to get to
[2484.56 - 2487.20] that goal
[2485.68 - 2489.76] you know of maintaining certain fat
[2487.20 - 2492.88] percentage i need food intervention i
[2489.76 - 2494.72] need to eat better eat smarter eat right
[2492.88 - 2496.80] so that's that's a very important point
[2494.72 - 2499.36] in the gene testing and the sports part
[2496.80 - 2501.44] uh we did for you shwathambri uh where
[2499.36 - 2503.68] we checked your endurance your power
[2501.44 - 2505.52] your cartilage damage your fatigue like
[2503.68 - 2508.00] i have the fatigue gene so i fatigue
[2505.52 - 2510.16] very fast so when i do my workouts i
[2508.00 - 2511.76] tend to take a little longer break
[2510.16 - 2513.52] between two sets
[2511.76 - 2514.72] in your case uh which was very
[2513.52 - 2517.84] surprising
[2514.72 - 2519.52] uh and this is for everyone out there
[2517.84 - 2521.60] people assume
[2519.52 - 2524.24] that exercise is going to be the
[2521.60 - 2526.56] absolute bar of fat burning
[2524.24 - 2528.08] but you may not have the genetics or the
[2526.56 - 2530.08] software code in you so basically it's
[2528.08 - 2532.00] like this sweet tamari doesn't have a
[2530.08 - 2533.68] pen drive in her that she can connect
[2532.00 - 2536.40] which says okay mr exercise start
[2533.68 - 2538.80] burning all the fat that dna is missing
[2536.40 - 2540.32] so she has to do constant physical work
[2538.80 - 2542.96] whereas there are certain people who can
[2540.32 - 2546.08] do high intensity activity and that just
[2542.96 - 2548.48] switches switches on the fat burning uh
[2546.08 - 2550.72] mechanism in the human body so that's uh
[2548.48 - 2552.48] that's found out right now and this is
[2550.72 - 2555.44] something that can be done
[2552.48 - 2557.04] uh we've got a few more questions
[2555.44 - 2558.72] yeah miss coyle's asking these days
[2557.04 - 2560.96] we're seeing high uric acid and high
[2558.72 - 2563.52] creatinine in many runners what could be
[2560.96 - 2566.08] the reason supplements or is it normal
[2563.52 - 2567.44] first things first
[2566.08 - 2569.84] in india we are predominantly a
[2567.44 - 2572.24] vegetarian country
[2569.84 - 2575.20] people assume that they can get a lot of
[2572.24 - 2577.04] uric acid from a high protein diet and
[2575.20 - 2579.84] when vegetarians decide to take up
[2577.04 - 2581.28] exercise they decide to eat more amount
[2579.84 - 2584.00] of dals
[2581.28 - 2586.16] which inadvertently may increase your
[2584.00 - 2589.36] uric acid so
[2586.16 - 2591.52] either the the the vegetarian dolls may
[2589.36 - 2593.12] increase the uric acid number one i've
[2591.52 - 2595.28] seen people who are pure vegetarians
[2593.12 - 2597.28] increase their milk and uric acid levels
[2595.28 - 2599.36] go up number two
[2597.28 - 2601.12] vegetarians assume they're vegetarians
[2599.36 - 2603.76] but you are actually non-vegetarian when
[2601.12 - 2606.64] you're an exercise person how you
[2603.76 - 2608.96] cannibalize your own muscle
[2606.64 - 2611.44] there's anabolism and there's catabolism
[2608.96 - 2613.52] anabolism is to build muscle catabolism
[2611.44 - 2616.16] is to break down muscle so when you are
[2613.52 - 2618.32] on a low protein diet you eat into your
[2616.16 - 2620.56] own vegetarian muscles
[2618.32 - 2623.04] so when you break down your muscles
[2620.56 - 2625.52] my assumption is that your uric acid
[2623.04 - 2628.32] which is a byproduct of the purines
[2625.52 - 2630.48] metabolism it's a breakdown of dna of
[2628.32 - 2632.56] animal protein and animal protein
[2630.48 - 2634.32] includes your own muscle as well as the
[2632.56 - 2636.80] creatine that is stored in your muscle
[2634.32 - 2638.72] and that could be why it's going up i
[2636.80 - 2640.72] don't believe it's supplements well
[2638.72 - 2642.32] sometimes yes people tend to douse with
[2640.72 - 2644.40] more supplements
[2642.32 - 2645.28] it's not the right element to go forward
[2644.40 - 2648.40] and then
[2645.28 - 2652.00] joshi asked in the same breath
[2648.40 - 2653.76] uh even after eating 2.2 kgs of protein
[2652.00 - 2655.92] and doing weight regular weight railing
[2653.76 - 2657.20] i'm still losing muscle mass along with
[2655.92 - 2660.16] fat
[2657.20 - 2660.88] maybe you have a gene like i have which
[2660.16 - 2662.80] is
[2660.88 - 2664.48] shwetambri knows me to be working out
[2662.80 - 2666.08] really crazy and heavy and i have no big
[2664.48 - 2669.04] muscles to show for it
[2666.08 - 2671.52] certain of us uh do not have the gene
[2669.04 - 2674.40] which is responsible for uh building
[2671.52 - 2676.72] muscle and and and i i learned this
[2674.40 - 2679.04] wherein in i think in spain or italy
[2676.72 - 2682.32] they began to remove this muscle
[2679.04 - 2683.44] they remove this gene from the cows
[2682.32 - 2685.84] that
[2683.44 - 2687.84] when they remove the gene it caused an
[2685.84 - 2689.20] overgrowth of muscle
[2687.84 - 2692.00] so some of us have a genetic
[2689.20 - 2693.68] predisposition to be leaner thinner and
[2692.00 - 2695.84] no matter how much of protein you know
[2693.68 - 2697.28] guys i get all the free protein in the
[2695.84 - 2699.44] world i call up fast enough fast enough
[2697.28 - 2700.80] to send me a truckload of protein i used
[2699.44 - 2702.64] to work for body fuels i used to work
[2700.80 - 2704.24] for mba i had all the free protein
[2702.64 - 2705.76] available in the world i should look
[2704.24 - 2707.04] like arnold schwarzenegger and say i'll
[2705.76 - 2709.52] be back but
[2707.04 - 2712.00] it's not protein that builds muscle it
[2709.52 - 2713.60] is the stimulus of weight training
[2712.00 - 2716.16] it is the stimulus of weight training
[2713.60 - 2717.92] and the correct diet so joshie if you
[2716.16 - 2720.24] are not getting results then maybe just
[2717.92 - 2721.36] putting protein into your body might be
[2720.24 - 2723.04] a wrong thing because you might be
[2721.36 - 2725.28] setting yourself up for more protein
[2723.04 - 2727.92] from a heart attack perspective by
[2725.28 - 2729.12] increasing your inflammatory markers so
[2727.92 - 2730.88] there's a lot we're doing from the
[2729.12 - 2732.64] microbiome which is your gut testing and
[2730.88 - 2734.16] when you put the wrong foods in they
[2732.64 - 2735.28] create a lot of inflammatory markers
[2734.16 - 2737.12] which go into your blood and then your
[2735.28 - 2739.20] c-reactive protein goes up and you
[2737.12 - 2741.20] increase the c-reactive or the
[2739.20 - 2742.80] inflammatory markers start beating up
[2741.20 - 2744.88] cholesterol so cholesterol gets more
[2742.80 - 2746.16] stickier sugar starts increasing because
[2744.88 - 2749.04] you want to eat more and more because
[2746.16 - 2751.04] even protein causes an insulin spike
[2749.04 - 2752.88] yes um so shwatami i don't know if i
[2751.04 - 2754.80] told you this but i had put a continuous
[2752.88 - 2756.00] glucose monitoring device on my hand
[2754.80 - 2758.08] last month
[2756.00 - 2761.44] and i was shocked to find out something
[2758.08 - 2762.80] like a cup of rice put my sugar really
[2761.44 - 2765.04] high up there
[2762.80 - 2766.96] so maybe joshua you want to check out a
[2765.04 - 2770.00] continuous glucose monitoring device and
[2766.96 - 2772.08] see you know how you want to go forward
[2770.00 - 2774.88] i also want to quickly add for surveys
[2772.08 - 2777.12] joshi rhyme that in his training you
[2774.88 - 2778.96] know he can probably change the way his
[2777.12 - 2781.68] weight training is being done
[2778.96 - 2784.88] right he can probably look at you know
[2781.68 - 2786.48] more hypertrophy model he can you know
[2784.88 - 2788.88] look at doing
[2786.48 - 2790.00] certain type like don't do very
[2788.88 - 2792.72] lightweight training or don't do
[2790.00 - 2795.12] extremely heavy do in between but for
[2792.72 - 2797.12] like eight to 12 reps so maybe he can
[2795.12 - 2798.32] change the way his weight training is
[2797.12 - 2801.04] being done
[2798.32 - 2803.44] to achieve you know certain maybe get
[2801.04 - 2804.88] his muscle mass to a better number you
[2803.44 - 2806.80] know that can also make a huge
[2804.88 - 2808.96] difference
[2806.80 - 2810.32] uh anik is asking and think shwathamri
[2808.96 - 2813.28] this is for you
[2810.32 - 2814.96] i follow low intensity exercises brisk
[2813.28 - 2818.80] walking and strength training to reduce
[2814.96 - 2821.12] my fat but i feel i need to add
[2818.80 - 2823.04] more variety to it as it gets boring
[2821.12 - 2824.56] which exercises would you recommend for
[2823.04 - 2825.36] fat loss
[2824.56 - 2827.92] yeah
[2825.36 - 2829.20] fab so you love it seems like you like
[2827.92 - 2832.08] brisk walking
[2829.20 - 2833.68] right uh so i would say continue that
[2832.08 - 2836.96] because that's something that's worked
[2833.68 - 2839.44] very well for me doing about 10 12 15
[2836.96 - 2842.16] 000 steps a day is like the best way to
[2839.44 - 2844.56] do get a lot of fat loss i'm not sure if
[2842.16 - 2846.64] you enjoy dance dance-based workout but
[2844.56 - 2848.16] dance fitness personally has not only
[2846.64 - 2850.72] worked for me but for a lot of my
[2848.16 - 2854.00] clients it has worked very well for fat
[2850.72 - 2855.68] loss boxing has worked extremely well
[2854.00 - 2857.92] and these are all the cardio kind of
[2855.68 - 2860.80] exercises i'm talking about uh is great
[2857.92 - 2862.88] for fat loss and then you know there is
[2860.80 - 2865.20] running all of these are great for fat
[2862.88 - 2868.24] loss but i would say
[2865.20 - 2869.68] mix it up with light weights right if
[2868.24 - 2872.32] you don't want to since i read that
[2869.68 - 2874.48] you're doing low intensity even with
[2872.32 - 2876.40] weights picking up lighter weights you
[2874.48 - 2878.40] can do low intensity exercises very
[2876.40 - 2880.56] basic stuff you know focus on your
[2878.40 - 2882.80] squats and lunges and some core workout
[2880.56 - 2884.72] just with your weights just adding a
[2882.80 - 2887.76] little bit of resistance training can
[2884.72 - 2890.00] contribute a lot towards fat loss so
[2887.76 - 2892.72] just alternate your cardio and strength
[2890.00 - 2894.48] days keep it low intensity not a problem
[2892.72 - 2897.36] you have your brisk walking taking care
[2894.48 - 2899.84] of the big chunk of the fat there uh but
[2897.36 - 2901.44] yeah mix it up do different things i i
[2899.84 - 2903.28] keep mixing it up you know the whole
[2901.44 - 2905.60] week different types of exercises
[2903.28 - 2908.40] conditioning and strength training it's
[2905.60 - 2910.72] fun and you get the desired results
[2908.40 - 2912.48] how often should we have a cheat day
[2910.72 - 2914.40] once a week or once a month how many
[2912.48 - 2916.72] calories can we have on a cheat day you
[2914.40 - 2918.64] know viber this is a brilliant question
[2916.72 - 2920.16] and
[2918.64 - 2922.80] i think
[2920.16 - 2924.80] mathematically it's very difficult as a
[2922.80 - 2927.20] nutritionist to have my personal
[2924.80 - 2928.48] supremacy on a diet even when i give a
[2927.20 - 2930.32] nutrition plan
[2928.48 - 2932.16] the calories are subject to a plus or
[2930.32 - 2934.00] minus 20 percent
[2932.16 - 2935.84] uh because of the way the food is grown
[2934.00 - 2938.00] because of your katori at home the way
[2935.84 - 2939.92] the methodology of preparation whilst i
[2938.00 - 2942.40] might tell you to make a certain type of
[2939.92 - 2943.20] vegetable subzi your servant decides to
[2942.40 - 2945.20] put
[2943.20 - 2946.96] four tablespoons of oil in that subsidy
[2945.20 - 2948.32] so the calorie content does always
[2946.96 - 2951.52] change
[2948.32 - 2954.32] so what i feel weibov is that a cheat
[2951.52 - 2956.24] meal is based more from a psychological
[2954.32 - 2958.88] perspective rather than a physiological
[2956.24 - 2961.68] perspective so over the years i've found
[2958.88 - 2964.64] this mantra that works very well
[2961.68 - 2967.84] i personally love having a bit of
[2964.64 - 2970.32] chocolate or i personally love having
[2967.84 - 2972.56] a coke every now and then which is the
[2970.32 - 2975.44] the aerated beverage so like you might
[2972.56 - 2978.00] find me at a leading restaurant with uh
[2975.44 - 2980.40] a cup of aerated beverage i i actually
[2978.00 - 2982.56] just take a little bit 100 ml now what's
[2980.40 - 2984.08] my logic over here
[2982.56 - 2986.64] i know that the cheat meal is
[2984.08 - 2989.44] psychological so i portion control the
[2986.64 - 2991.92] cheat meal i try and do it frequently
[2989.44 - 2993.12] but the rest of my meals i'm very very
[2991.92 - 2995.68] focused on
[2993.12 - 2997.60] monday to friday or saturday
[2995.68 - 2999.68] the breakfast lunch dinner whatever i'm
[2997.60 - 3003.04] doing i'm very specific and i keep the
[2999.68 - 3005.44] consistency on my workout or movement to
[3003.04 - 3008.56] know that i'm not consuming more than
[3005.44 - 3011.04] i'm actually uh requiring and and this
[3008.56 - 3012.32] is food for thought in sri tamri i'm i'm
[3011.04 - 3014.32] actually going to be working on
[3012.32 - 3015.60] something which i'll invite you on board
[3014.32 - 3017.20] later with
[3015.60 - 3019.68] which is
[3017.20 - 3023.04] i want to build the world's first
[3019.68 - 3025.28] bmi carbon footprint uh making you feel
[3023.04 - 3027.68] guilty scale
[3025.28 - 3029.28] think about it the heavier you are on
[3027.68 - 3031.36] this planet the more your carbon
[3029.28 - 3033.04] footprint so forget about heart attack
[3031.36 - 3036.16] forget about everything else if you are
[3033.04 - 3039.04] if you're if you're a warrior i predict
[3036.16 - 3042.08] in this 2022 that there will be a
[3039.04 - 3044.32] shortly a day where you will step onto
[3042.08 - 3045.76] the weighing scale at the airport along
[3044.32 - 3048.08] with your baggage
[3045.76 - 3050.32] and then uh vistara will not tell you me
[3048.08 - 3051.76] mr fernando you are overweight i'll be
[3050.32 - 3052.80] looking at my baggage i'll be looking at
[3051.76 - 3054.64] myself
[3052.80 - 3057.12] did you check the guy behind me he's
[3054.64 - 3058.24] like 200 kgs with his baggage combined
[3057.12 - 3060.56] so
[3058.24 - 3063.44] very very important a cheating meal is
[3060.56 - 3064.56] psychological it's not physiological so
[3063.44 - 3066.56] people
[3064.56 - 3068.64] think they will let go for one sheet
[3066.56 - 3070.72] meal there's no physical activity on
[3068.64 - 3071.76] that saturday or sunday so bye-bye if i
[3070.72 - 3074.48] were you
[3071.76 - 3076.88] i would do camping i would do or i would
[3074.48 - 3078.80] do my crossfit i would do my dancing at
[3076.88 - 3080.64] the night club
[3078.80 - 3081.68] and just burn a whole lot of calories
[3080.64 - 3084.16] and
[3081.68 - 3085.60] keep the portion small in the cheat meal
[3084.16 - 3088.80] he asked another question to you
[3085.60 - 3090.88] shwathamri which is is it okay for obese
[3088.80 - 3092.88] people to run
[3090.88 - 3097.52] if yes is running on the treadmill
[3092.88 - 3100.32] advice every day or alternate days yeah
[3097.52 - 3102.32] absolutely i think obese people
[3100.32 - 3105.44] should start with walking
[3102.32 - 3107.20] move to brisk walking you know easy jog
[3105.44 - 3110.00] and then go into like a little more
[3107.20 - 3112.08] faster running treadmills can be used
[3110.00 - 3114.80] outdoor running also can be done
[3112.08 - 3117.12] there is honestly no problem using
[3114.80 - 3118.64] treadmills i would just say that uh you
[3117.12 - 3121.68] know for someone who's obese and is
[3118.64 - 3123.20] sedentary and they'll have some sort of
[3121.68 - 3125.36] joint pain and all of that that will
[3123.20 - 3126.56] happen and that will happen irrespective
[3125.36 - 3128.16] whether they're running on the treadmill
[3126.56 - 3130.88] or running outside on the road which is
[3128.16 - 3133.20] why i'm saying start slow but yes it'll
[3130.88 - 3135.12] be great if they can start you know jogs
[3133.20 - 3137.28] and walks and brisk walks and running
[3135.12 - 3140.24] it's a fabulous way it's easy it's
[3137.28 - 3142.40] simple not dependent on anything and
[3140.24 - 3144.40] good to start losing that extra fat in
[3142.40 - 3146.32] the body you know sri tamri i work with
[3144.40 - 3149.52] a lot of orthopedic surgeons my pop in
[3146.32 - 3151.44] law is a orthopedic surgeon and um you
[3149.52 - 3154.56] know you get to listen to the physios
[3151.44 - 3157.52] the the knee experts acl reconstruction
[3154.56 - 3160.08] when a person runs the knee impacts at
[3157.52 - 3162.40] 4.5 times its body weight
[3160.08 - 3165.60] so let's assume somebody's 100 kg
[3162.40 - 3167.76] starting weight of 100 kgs 400 kgs on
[3165.60 - 3170.08] that knee when they run
[3167.76 - 3172.00] so the ideal perspective that has always
[3170.08 - 3173.12] been told to me from the orthopedic
[3172.00 - 3174.56] community
[3173.12 - 3176.48] uh is that
[3174.56 - 3177.92] uh if somebody's at about 100 kgs and
[3176.48 - 3182.08] they need to be at 60 kgs they're
[3177.92 - 3184.64] carrying an extra 40 kgs 40 kg so uh the
[3182.08 - 3187.76] the thumb rule is if you walk 15 000
[3184.64 - 3189.28] steps a day you can get a 2 kg fat loss
[3187.76 - 3192.40] per month
[3189.28 - 3195.44] so viber i would say that 2 kgs fat loss
[3192.40 - 3197.92] per month by walking 15 000 steps a day
[3195.44 - 3200.24] no load on that if you want to run run
[3197.92 - 3203.60] in a swimming pool all all people who
[3200.24 - 3205.20] have bmi above 24 should in my opinion
[3203.60 - 3207.28] run in a swimming pool to save your
[3205.20 - 3210.16] knees so that you can run even when
[3207.28 - 3213.12] you're a 70 year old at 60 kgs
[3210.16 - 3216.56] absolutely so that would be my advice to
[3213.12 - 3218.96] to to to viber and uh um if you if your
[3216.56 - 3221.12] families are born runners then you
[3218.96 - 3223.12] should have no joint iteration and stuff
[3221.12 - 3225.52] like that so then please do run but if
[3223.12 - 3226.96] you come from uh ryan fernando's family
[3225.52 - 3228.24] where half the family is on walking
[3226.96 - 3230.80] sticks and all and you have joint
[3228.24 - 3232.56] iteration then you want to be focusing
[3230.80 - 3234.00] on cardiovascular
[3232.56 - 3236.72] exercises
[3234.00 - 3238.80] not using your legs to run but doing
[3236.72 - 3241.28] dance workouts or continuous workouts or
[3238.80 - 3243.04] going working yeah go keeping your your
[3241.28 - 3245.52] rest between workouts and stuff like
[3243.04 - 3246.88] that in the gym and stuff like that and
[3245.52 - 3248.84] sri tamri that's one of the reasons why
[3246.88 - 3251.36] i never turned up at your dance classes
[3248.84 - 3253.04] because i realized i would dance i love
[3251.36 - 3255.04] to dance but then my knees are gone the
[3253.04 - 3256.88] next day even as a light weight
[3255.04 - 3258.72] so you know you have to figure this out
[3256.88 - 3260.08] you you have to figure this out
[3258.72 - 3263.28] and so i think
[3260.08 - 3266.08] as experts when we are working with you
[3263.28 - 3269.44] it's always an individualized basis to
[3266.08 - 3271.52] your diet individualized basis to to
[3269.44 - 3274.00] your exercise so get in touch with your
[3271.52 - 3275.36] expert and ask them what we want to do
[3274.00 - 3278.08] there's a nutrition question from
[3275.36 - 3280.32] manisha hey manisha how are you doing is
[3278.08 - 3281.92] honey lemon warm water morning helpful
[3280.32 - 3283.60] for weight loss
[3281.92 - 3284.96] this has been around for centuries in
[3283.60 - 3286.48] ayurveda
[3284.96 - 3288.40] very interestingly i share you the
[3286.48 - 3289.92] scientific perspective which you
[3288.40 - 3290.96] probably won't find on any internet
[3289.92 - 3292.96] channel
[3290.96 - 3294.00] i was recently received a product from
[3292.96 - 3295.76] canada
[3294.00 - 3297.84] which for for people who have gut
[3295.76 - 3298.96] problems to heal the lining of their
[3297.84 - 3301.04] stomach
[3298.96 - 3304.24] you need to boost something known as
[3301.04 - 3306.96] n-acetyl glucosamine now n-acetyl
[3304.24 - 3308.88] glucosamine forms mucin which is you can
[3306.96 - 3311.44] call like the scaffolding inside your
[3308.88 - 3313.44] intestine which builds the protection
[3311.44 - 3316.16] and the integrity which allows for
[3313.44 - 3319.52] better absorption of food
[3316.16 - 3321.20] when you combine glucose glutamine and
[3319.52 - 3323.28] fructose
[3321.20 - 3326.08] you produce the body's natural and
[3323.28 - 3328.80] acetyl glucosamine when you take lemon
[3326.08 - 3331.36] and you take honey and warm water you're
[3328.80 - 3332.24] providing a certain raw material early
[3331.36 - 3334.72] morning
[3332.24 - 3336.88] so manisha what i would recommend to you
[3334.72 - 3338.80] find an amino acid called glutamine put
[3336.88 - 3340.16] about three grams of it in your honey
[3338.80 - 3342.64] and lemon water and take it early
[3340.16 - 3344.64] morning because it heals your gut lining
[3342.64 - 3347.20] and when you heal your gut lining
[3344.64 - 3349.12] metabolism absorption gets better you
[3347.20 - 3350.56] don't need to eat
[3349.12 - 3352.40] trashy food
[3350.56 - 3354.56] and your body gives you feedback that
[3352.40 - 3357.52] you're absorbing better so even when you
[3354.56 - 3359.28] eat a crappy meal which is high calorie
[3357.52 - 3361.84] the body kind of stops you but when your
[3359.28 - 3363.68] gut is ravaged or damaged the feedback
[3361.84 - 3366.00] signal of satiety to the brain is
[3363.68 - 3367.36] shortened so there's a lot of wisdom
[3366.00 - 3369.44] ancient wisdom

[3438.96 - 3443.20] us for a diet plan but i do genuinely
[3441.60 - 3445.12] believe that

[3445.12 - 3450.00] you know my first
[3446.40 - 3451.92] car was a second-hand thousand

[3456.16 - 3461.60] your diet you'll upgrade your workout
[3459.52 - 3463.76] so i'm saying to you
[3461.60 - 3465.60] you cannot change this body of yours
[3463.76 - 3468.16] it's not replaceable i can't make ryan
[3465.60 - 3470.56] fernando skoda to ryan fernando mercedes
[3468.16 - 3472.08] to ryan fernando rolls-royce
[3470.56 - 3474.56] i can only
[3472.08 - 3476.72] make ryan fernando be as best as
[3474.56 - 3478.40] possible in terms of diet and exercise
[3476.72 - 3480.56] so these are small small things that you
[3478.40 - 3483.28] can start doing
[3480.56 - 3485.44] be aware and schwa tamri i know you've
[3483.28 - 3488.72] been my client for so long but if i come
[3485.44 - 3490.80] home today and have dinner with you um
[3488.72 - 3493.12] will there be organic tomatoes in your
[3490.80 - 3493.12] house
[3493.52 - 3497.92] uh i just bring my vegetables from a
[3495.92 - 3500.72] farm that's all okay good so we are
[3497.92 - 3502.32] hoping that this farm is organic so
[3500.72 - 3504.32] furthering to your counsel let's imagine
[3502.32 - 3506.40] you're in my counseling room today the
[3504.32 - 3508.64] reason i want organic
[3506.40 - 3510.56] is because it reduces the pesticide and
[3508.64 - 3512.32] chemical and insecticide load on my
[3510.56 - 3514.16] liver and kidney
[3512.32 - 3516.56] that could be another reason people are
[3514.16 - 3518.56] getting morbidly obese
[3516.56 - 3520.24] another tip
[3518.56 - 3522.00] and i think the e-commerce apps are
[3520.24 - 3524.64] going to hate us for this
[3522.00 - 3527.36] your zomato and swiggy
[3524.64 - 3530.72] are the devil in the disguise
[3527.36 - 3533.60] for not looking great i repeat zomato
[3530.72 - 3534.48] and swiggy are the devil in disguise for
[3533.60 - 3536.80] not
[3534.48 - 3537.84] making you look and feel great i'll tell
[3536.80 - 3539.68] you why
[3537.84 - 3542.24] last night i wanted to eat a high
[3539.68 - 3543.92] protein meal i was too lazy to go to my
[3542.24 - 3545.92] fridge would hatch organic food what did
[3543.92 - 3548.48] i do swiggy
[3545.92 - 3550.72]  press a button 45 minutes later
[3548.48 - 3553.28] i had something that was unhealthy i
[3550.72 - 3555.28] wanted to have sushi which was healthy
[3553.28 - 3557.20] but i ended up being distracted by the
[3555.28 - 3560.80] app and all this discount and all so i
[3557.20 - 3563.36] think in 2022 those of you who are
[3560.80 - 3565.84] on the borderline of i'm fed up of my
[3563.36 - 3568.88] life i want to change my life i i want
[3565.84 - 3570.64] to do something i'm depressed i'm not
[3568.88 - 3572.00] feeling happy i wish i could be a
[3570.64 - 3574.24] celebrity i wish i could be a
[3572.00 - 3576.64] millionaire the one tip that i would
[3574.24 - 3578.40] give you to start feeling better to
[3576.64 - 3581.44] start looking up is
[3578.40 - 3583.36] stop ordering from outside
[3581.44 - 3584.24] the reason behind this is i will tell
[3583.36 - 3586.08] you
[3584.24 - 3588.32] many many years ago i ran a very
[3586.08 - 3591.92] successful brand that uh provided
[3588.32 - 3593.92] healthy meals to the corporates
[3591.92 - 3596.40] but the guys that prepared those foods
[3593.92 - 3598.48] no matter how much i remember yelling
[3596.40 - 3599.68] and screaming in the kitchen and it's
[3598.48 - 3601.12] like you're only a nutritionist you're
[3599.68 - 3604.16] not even a chef
[3601.12 - 3606.08] was the way they treated food no matter
[3604.16 - 3608.00] what the principles no matter what the
[3606.08 - 3611.76] restaurant owner wants
[3608.00 - 3614.24] the people preparing your food are cooks
[3611.76 - 3616.16] they will not wash the cabbage which has
[3614.24 - 3618.16] got all the insecticides and pesticides
[3616.16 - 3620.56] before cutting it and putting it in your
[3618.16 - 3622.72] food this is what happens in a in a in a
[3620.56 - 3625.36] commercial kitchen
[3622.72 - 3626.96] not washed thrown directly into the pan
[3625.36 - 3629.12] so even if little insecticides and
[3626.96 - 3631.12] pesticides have to be washed off
[3629.12 - 3632.80] people restaurant guys are gonna gonna
[3631.12 - 3634.24] assassinate me on the internet for this
[3632.80 - 3637.60] they're gonna say how do you know have
[3634.24 - 3640.64] you been in our kitchen i am telling you
[3637.60 - 3643.20] if i take a confession from every person
[3640.64 - 3643.20] that runs
[3654.80 - 3659.12] so we have to incentivize them to wash
[3657.20 - 3661.60] sink one thing to sink three so
[3659.12 - 3663.76] pesticides are more in your ordered food
[3661.60 - 3665.12] from outside number two
[3663.76 - 3667.20] dalda
[3665.12 - 3668.20] palm oil has
[3667.20 - 3670.48] huge
[3668.20 - 3671.60] organoleptic properties on your taste
[3670.48 - 3673.76] buds
[3671.60 - 3675.28] there was this dhaba in i don't know
[3673.76 - 3677.68] where i don't i don't know it was in
[3675.28 - 3679.60] puna or something so the cardiologist
[3677.68 - 3681.84] convinced that guy to prepare his paw
[3679.60 - 3684.40] bhaji with a different oil instead of
[3681.84 - 3686.08] using dalda overnight apparently people
[3684.40 - 3688.96] started disappearing
[3686.08 - 3690.96] because the taste changed
[3688.96 - 3694.16] so so the fact of the matter is when you
[3690.96 - 3697.28] use palmitic acid which is the most
[3694.16 - 3698.88] aggressive for plaque formation i repeat
[3697.28 - 3700.40] so when i go out people are always
[3698.88 - 3704.64] looking at me like crying why you're not
[3700.40 - 3704.64] very happy eating out i'm thinking
[3705.12 - 3710.32] 150 k rupees per kg bloody olive oil is
[3708.08 - 3712.24] 600 rupees a kg which guy will use olive
[3710.32 - 3715.60] oil which guy will use cold press sesame
[3712.24 - 3717.36] oil which guy will use cold press
[3715.60 - 3720.08] ground nut oil
[3717.36 - 3722.80] so i'm i'm just appealing to people that
[3720.08 - 3724.56] in 2022 if you have money
[3722.80 - 3726.56] hire a chef
[3724.56 - 3728.32] if you don't have that much of money
[3726.56 - 3730.00] five of you get together have a party
[3728.32 - 3731.84] invite a chef to cook for you and buy
[3730.00 - 3734.08] all the produce and make it organic and
[3731.84 - 3737.68] tell the chef don't use dalda by the way
[3734.08 - 3739.68] speaking of dalda i take a blood test of
[3737.68 - 3742.00] omega 6 and omega 3 and i send it to
[3739.68 - 3743.92] norway to check your inflammation rate
[3742.00 - 3746.08] so if you have a heart disease i can
[3743.92 - 3747.76] afford 9 000 bucks prick your finger
[3746.08 - 3750.40] send the blood test norway i did it
[3747.76 - 3750.40] sweetheart
[3750.96 - 3753.84] and so
[3752.16 - 3755.36] i have to make a public confession the
[3753.84 - 3757.36] zomato and swiggy convinces me to have
[3755.36 - 3759.52] my cheat meal from outside every week my
[3757.36 - 3760.32] palmitic oil levels were high
[3759.52 - 3762.48] yeah
[3760.32 - 3763.84] so to bring it down i asked the swedish
[3762.48 - 3766.48] guy what's your reason
[3763.84 - 3769.92] stop eating this trans fat stop eating
[3766.48 - 3772.48] this palm oil uh and you will watch your
[3769.92 - 3774.64] uh omega-6 and omega-9 automatically
[3772.48 - 3775.52] drop it to the inflammatory markers
[3774.64 - 3777.28] right
[3775.52 - 3778.96] there
[3777.28 - 3780.96] are there a lot of more questions uh
[3778.96 - 3784.08] let's let's just take four five more i'm
[3780.96 - 3786.16] just finding any exercise questions
[3784.08 - 3788.48] yeah there is one on uh poonam asking
[3786.16 - 3791.76] does cardio make you lose muscle
[3788.48 - 3794.56] so very quickly poonam uh yes
[3791.76 - 3796.24] that's the answer but you need cardio
[3794.56 - 3798.16] you can't do without cardio right i'll
[3796.24 - 3799.04] give you my own example i
[3798.16 - 3801.12] did
[3799.04 - 3802.88] cardio for a living right that was my
[3801.12 - 3805.28] profession teaching a lot of dance
[3802.88 - 3806.80] fitness and etc so when i didn't combine
[3805.28 - 3808.80] it with strength training i ended up
[3806.80 - 3811.60] hurting myself because of extreme muscle
[3808.80 - 3813.12] loss and now over the last many years
[3811.60 - 3815.12] since i've incorporated a lot of
[3813.12 - 3817.84] strength training and alternated well
[3815.12 - 3820.16] with cardio i have zero injuries zero
[3817.84 - 3821.92] aches and pains and etc and you know i
[3820.16 - 3823.68] have good fat loss
[3821.92 - 3826.32] decent you know muscle gain and all of
[3823.68 - 3828.00] that so if you're doing only cardio yes
[3826.32 - 3830.32] you'll lose a good amount of fat but
[3828.00 - 3832.24] after after losing that fat it will
[3830.32 - 3834.88] start eating into your muscle so you
[3832.24 - 3836.96] need a combination of cardio and
[3834.88 - 3839.84] weights
[3836.96 - 3841.84] right yeah then there is a question
[3839.84 - 3843.76] again from uvashi
[3841.84 - 3844.88] you want me to read it for you started
[3843.76 - 3846.80] strength training i find it very
[3844.88 - 3849.84] difficult to consume proteins in every
[3846.80 - 3851.60] meal i tried whey and i got uti can
[3849.84 - 3853.76] vegetarian protein be included with
[3851.60 - 3855.60] animal protein
[3853.76 - 3857.84] wow you know what before i take this
[3855.60 - 3859.36] question i know you have a busy schedule
[3857.84 - 3861.44] i want to ask you what are you doing for
[3859.36 - 3863.20] the new year's in terms of cult fit
[3861.44 - 3864.84] before i let you go i'm going to take
[3863.20 - 3867.20] all of these questions offline with
[3864.84 - 3870.16] everybody but yeah i heard something
[3867.20 - 3870.16] about a belly burn
[3870.64 - 3876.00] yeah sounds quite corny you know i feel
[3873.04 - 3878.00] like belly burn okay very quickly again
[3876.00 - 3881.44] so this is a program that's gonna start
[3878.00 - 3883.68] it's a four week uh workout program with
[3881.44 - 3885.76] me the program is called belly burn
[3883.68 - 3887.60] season one was last year season two
[3885.76 - 3889.60] starts day after tomorrow which is
[3887.60 - 3891.68] monday we wanted to start you know the
[3889.60 - 3894.56] new year where do i find it where do i
[3891.68 - 3896.40] google up for it everything online you
[3894.56 - 3898.80] just have to download the culprit app
[3896.40 - 3901.12] and the workout is there on the cult app
[3898.80 - 3903.12] so it's a c-u-l-t-f-i-t
[3901.12 - 3906.08] app called fit app okay
[3903.12 - 3908.96] yeah culprit app and also we have a
[3906.08 - 3911.28] one-month free trial period for
[3908.96 - 3913.76] everybody to use who who's never used
[3911.28 - 3916.16] the app before so most probably this
[3913.76 - 3918.96] entire program can probably be used by
[3916.16 - 3921.20] people for free it's a four week program
[3918.96 - 3923.60] and guess what it's not just about
[3921.20 - 3924.56] working out monday to friday you know
[3923.60 - 3927.28] with me
[3924.56 - 3929.12] you also have recoveries planned on
[3927.28 - 3931.04] saturday which is a proper recovery
[3929.12 - 3933.52] workout and
[3931.04 - 3935.76] no fat burn can happen without eating
[3933.52 - 3938.24] right so we have a meal plan which is
[3935.76 - 3941.76] obviously designed by ryan fernando and
[3938.24 - 3944.32] qua right so it's a combination of a
[3941.76 - 3945.92] workout again body weight optional
[3944.32 - 3948.16] dumbbells i've given options for
[3945.92 - 3950.56] dumbbells as well it's a 45 minute
[3948.16 - 3952.48] workout every day you can choose any
[3950.56 - 3955.52] time you want right it's not like i'm

[3962.24 - 3966.48] also there and it's on the app so you
[3964.80 - 3968.56] just have to download it and follow it
[3966.48 - 3970.56] through for the entire four weeks
[3968.56 - 3972.96] there's also these challenges where 15
[3970.56 - 3974.80] 000 steps a day for you know intimate
[3972.96 - 3976.72] advanced athletes for beginners it's
[3974.80 - 3979.68] just about six to eight thousand steps a
[3976.72 - 3980.96] day and it's for all beginners
[3979.68 - 3982.24] intermediate advanced because we've
[3980.96 - 3984.88] scaled it down
[3982.24 - 3986.64] scale it up based on what your intensity
[3984.88 - 3989.12] is if you're starting out restarting all
[3986.64 - 3990.88] of that and uh in belly burn one just
[3989.12 - 3992.88] very quickly ryan we've seen great
[3990.88 - 3995.60] successes we had over 10 000 people
[3992.88 - 3997.36] doing it and we saw huge success rate in
[3995.60 - 3999.04] terms of inch loss and that's what we
[3997.36 - 4001.04] look at we don't ask people to really
[3999.04 - 4003.20] step on the weighing scale we say take a
[4001.04 - 4004.72] measure measuring tape and tell me the
[4003.20 - 4006.16] difference are your old clothes fitting
[4004.72 - 4007.84] you better are you clothes fitting
[4006.16 - 4010.16] you're better stuff like that so we've
[4007.84 - 4012.40] seen huge success of course i think four
[4010.16 - 4014.96] weeks consistently working out eating
[4012.40 - 4016.88] right anybody will see success so yeah
[4014.96 - 4018.24] if you feel like working out with me we

[4034.80 - 4039.04] almost getting ready so shwathamri said
[4037.28 - 4041.20] in december itself you know what i need
[4039.04 - 4043.12] to get started in the new year uh i
[4041.20 - 4044.88] don't think she needs a nutrition plan
[4043.12 - 4046.72] from an aesthetic point of view which is
[4044.88 - 4048.80] why most of you were like can i lose
[4046.72 - 4051.12] this fat or can i can i get these love
[4048.80 - 4053.52] handles off shwathamri is an elite
[4051.12 - 4055.76] athlete her perspective is
[4053.52 - 4058.56] how do i get anti-aging
[4055.76 - 4062.00] how do i get more out of my workout how
[4058.56 - 4064.32] do i get better energy during the day so
[4062.00 - 4066.72] nutrition perspective is not only fat
[4064.32 - 4068.08] burning from the belly area which is for
[4066.72 - 4071.36] most people
[4068.08 - 4072.72] a big chunk of your thought process but
[4071.36 - 4074.64] i would say
[4072.72 - 4078.80] look beyond that you're going to live on
[4074.64 - 4080.80] this planet for 10 20 30 40 50 60 years
[4078.80 - 4082.64] 70 years maybe if you're a youngster
[4080.80 - 4084.88] watching this video
[4082.64 - 4087.12] you can't replace your vehicle you can
[4084.88 - 4089.84] only take it to the rice servicing
[4087.12 - 4092.80] garage one of those servicing garages is
[4089.84 - 4095.52] cult fit where shwatambri practices or
[4092.80 - 4097.36] any exercise place that you love
[4095.52 - 4100.32] and the other garage where you can take
[4097.36 - 4101.84] it for maintenance is the nutritionist
[4100.32 - 4104.40] who can help you
[4101.84 - 4106.24] eat scientifically instead of you eating
[4104.40 - 4108.08] out of love and culture from your
[4106.24 - 4109.76] parents shaytan i won't hold you back
[4108.08 - 4111.76] i've got a lot of nutrition questions
[4109.76 - 4113.36] i'm going to take that i know you're i
[4111.76 - 4116.48] know your little guy must be somewhere
[4113.36 - 4119.12] around this and and
[4116.48 - 4120.80] little little girl needs you over there
[4119.12 - 4123.04] and um
[4120.80 - 4125.36] it's a saturday but i just want to say i
[4123.04 - 4128.08] i want to tell everyone who's you know
[4125.36 - 4130.16] listening and watching that um
[4128.08 - 4132.64] exercise and nutrition go hand in hand
[4130.16 - 4134.72] there is no way you can separate the two
[4132.64 - 4137.04] even for someone like me i know for a
[4134.72 - 4139.12] fact that i've got decent metabolism
[4137.04 - 4141.28] when i eat a slice of cake
[4139.12 - 4143.84] i know it's not just getting stored some
[4141.28 - 4146.40] of it is actually burning away right i
[4143.84 - 4149.20] know that i have that confidence but
[4146.40 - 4151.92] i know that if i need to consistently
[4149.20 - 4153.68] you know eat well i need a good plan and
[4151.92 - 4155.68] i need you know someone like ryan to
[4153.68 - 4158.08] help me through it right i i can
[4155.68 - 4160.08] probably make a so-called meal plan but
[4158.08 - 4162.80] not like what a ryan fernando or aqua
[4160.08 - 4165.60] would do so which is why i always keep
[4162.80 - 4167.52] in mind workout consistently eat right
[4165.60 - 4169.28] enjoy your meals whenever you do you
[4167.52 - 4171.44] know the the cheat meal i call it the
[4169.28 - 4173.60] reward meal but yeah
[4171.44 - 4175.92] do it right all the way and enjoy the
[4173.60 - 4177.84] benefits that the body gets and the mind
[4175.92 - 4179.28] gets thank you thank you so much thank
[4177.84 - 4180.16] you today
[4179.28 - 4182.08] everyone
[4180.16 - 4184.40] stay safe and i'll see you in your next
[4182.08 - 4186.56] diet session i'll see you happy new year
[4184.40 - 4188.48] bye bye wish you the same
[4186.56 - 4190.32] okay so we've got far more questions
[4188.48 - 4191.52] coming in over here which i'm going to
[4190.32 - 4193.68] answer
[4191.52 - 4196.64] and um
[4193.68 - 4198.00] anushka says i am allergic to gluten and
[4196.64 - 4200.24] dairy
[4198.00 - 4201.92] what can normal middle class people have
[4200.24 - 4203.36] as an alternative to both gluten and
[4201.92 - 4205.20] dairy so
[4203.36 - 4208.72] anushka
[4205.20 - 4210.32] i am also gluten intolerant and i'm also
[4208.72 - 4213.36] lactose and dairy intolerance i'm
[4210.32 - 4213.36] exactly like you
[4214.00 - 4219.36] i look at cashew milk i look at coconut
[4216.72 - 4221.04] milk i look at
[4219.36 - 4223.12] almond milk
[4221.04 - 4225.52] and i look at oat milk urban clap has an
[4223.12 - 4229.20] amazing oat milk now
[4225.52 - 4230.72] milk is milk okay a milk coffee or a
[4229.20 - 4232.16] milk rasmalai
[4230.72 - 4233.44] there's no difference between cashew and
[4232.16 - 4235.12] that okay you've got to get one thing on
[4233.44 - 4237.76] the mind the completely different taste
[4235.12 - 4239.52] so you have to transition into accepting
[4237.76 - 4241.68] the new thing like coffee with almond
[4239.52 - 4243.44] milk and coffee with normal milk is two
[4241.68 - 4245.68] different worlds
[4243.44 - 4247.36] but over a period of two or three years
[4245.68 - 4248.96] your taste buds acclimatize like for
[4247.36 - 4251.12] example to the in the morning i had a
[4248.96 - 4252.56] sip of coffee with real milk in it
[4251.12 - 4254.00] because it was made for somebody and i
[4252.56 - 4256.32] was like let me try it for a little bit
[4254.00 - 4259.68] i had it like i don't like this i like
[4256.32 - 4261.44] my oatmeal coffee so
[4259.68 - 4263.68] that is one perspective
[4261.44 - 4265.12] for the gluten perspective
[4263.68 - 4270.24] um
[4265.12 - 4272.96] rice oats corn johar bajra amranth
[4270.24 - 4275.28] all of these are possible in terms of
[4272.96 - 4278.16] gluten options there's there's a
[4275.28 - 4279.76] brilliant bakery in ludhiana called sai
[4278.16 - 4282.16] foods ludhiana
[4279.76 - 4283.76] sai foods ludhiana they have rusk
[4282.16 - 4286.64] biscuit which is gluten free they have
[4283.76 - 4288.16] coconut biscuits as a kid i grew up with
[4286.64 - 4289.84] jam biscuits i can't believe i'm giving
[4288.16 - 4291.28] this information out as a nutritionist
[4289.84 - 4293.68] okay but
[4291.28 - 4295.52] you're human right so i would say that
[4293.68 - 4298.56] at four o'clock in the evening you wanna
[4295.52 - 4300.40] have two or three jam biscuits uh or
[4298.56 - 4301.44] cream biscuits you do get them gluten
[4300.40 - 4303.44] free
[4301.44 - 4306.40] i live in bangalore and now most of the
[4303.44 - 4307.76] metros have some amazing bakers
[4306.40 - 4309.44] now these are people that are going to
[4307.76 - 4311.76] make us put on weight because gluten
[4309.44 - 4313.92] free options are like normal options
[4311.76 - 4315.60] full of sugar and full of baking items
[4313.92 - 4316.40] into it so
[4315.60 - 4318.32] you know
[4316.40 - 4320.00] it is what you need to do which is get
[4318.32 - 4323.76] in touch with a nutritionist to help you
[4320.00 - 4325.44] plan a better shopping list a better uh
[4323.76 - 4328.32] a choice of foods like how much should
[4325.44 - 4329.44] you eat you know at the end of the day
[4328.32 - 4331.28] um
[4329.44 - 4333.36] somebody just said my calcium level is
[4331.28 - 4335.20] inefficient what should i do
[4333.36 - 4336.32] um get in touch with us at core
[4335.20 - 4338.56] nutrition
[4336.32 - 4340.80] i do genuinely believe that when you are
[4338.56 - 4344.08] when you try you know recently what
[4340.80 - 4346.56] happened is so i have this uh old cycle
[4344.08 - 4347.84] okay so i thought area old cycle now
[4346.56 - 4349.28] we'll take some free advice from
[4347.84 - 4350.48] somebody how to get it repaired and all
[4349.28 - 4352.40] of that stuff
[4350.48 - 4354.32] i ended up spending more money because i
[4352.40 - 4356.96] took free advice i should have just gone
[4354.32 - 4359.52] to that cycle mechanic say by yellow 500
[4356.96 - 4362.00] rupees just go take care though
[4359.52 - 4363.52] but inside conducive fellow inside of me
[4362.00 - 4365.28] said no boss am i who's going to spend
[4363.52 - 4366.40] an i'll do some googling up and all of
[4365.28 - 4369.36] that stuff
[4366.40 - 4371.68] whenever you try to not i mean the same
[4369.36 - 4373.04] thing goes with mobile phones do you try
[4371.68 - 4375.20] and repair your own mobile phone do you
[4373.04 - 4377.28] try and repair your own car your car's
[4375.20 - 4378.96] making a sound take it to the mechanic
[4377.28 - 4380.96] your calcium levels are out talk to your
[4378.96 - 4382.72] doctor talk to your nutritionist i think
[4380.96 - 4385.20] uh that that would really really help
[4382.72 - 4388.48] you you know somebody said they tried
[4385.20 - 4391.04] whey protein and got a uti um
[4388.48 - 4394.00] i i would i would say
[4391.04 - 4395.60] in 2022 and i know a lot of supplement
[4394.00 - 4397.28] companies are not going to like me for
[4395.60 - 4398.40] this i used to work for supplement
[4397.28 - 4400.88] companies
[4398.40 - 4402.96] i think the problem is not protein
[4400.88 - 4404.24] i think the problem first lies with you
[4402.96 - 4406.56] not knowing
[4404.24 - 4407.76] how much you need to eat of calories
[4406.56 - 4409.92] first level
[4407.76 - 4412.40] then how much of protein do you need for
[4409.92 - 4414.40] in those calories and then which protein
[4412.40 - 4416.48] should you add from the natural diet
[4414.40 - 4418.96] which i believe can generally fulfill
[4416.48 - 4420.56] your protein requirement now for many
[4418.96 - 4421.92] years i took protein supplements and
[4420.56 - 4423.60] tried to bulk up and you know everyone
[4421.92 - 4425.12] says oh ryan fernando you're so skinny
[4423.60 - 4427.20] you're a skinny nutritionist you know
[4425.12 - 4428.72] there's an internal turmoil like
[4427.20 - 4430.08] what can i do you know my genetics don't
[4428.72 - 4432.24] allow me to put on weight i've always
[4430.08 - 4434.16] been skinny i had gluten allergies i had
[4432.24 - 4435.60] pimples bleed blue blah blah i would
[4434.16 - 4437.12] douse myself with all of these whey
[4435.60 - 4438.64] proteins and plant proteins and nothing
[4437.12 - 4441.36] would happen and only my gut would be
[4438.64 - 4443.04] bad in this case a person saying i got a
[4441.36 - 4444.72] uti
[4443.04 - 4446.32] could it be coincidence here's what you
[4444.72 - 4447.20] do if you're willing to risk the uti
[4446.32 - 4448.96] again
[4447.20 - 4452.00] do another session three four months
[4448.96 - 4454.32] later have the whey protein add nettle
[4452.00 - 4455.20] tea which is a diuretic nettle tea will
[4454.32 - 4457.44] flush
[4455.20 - 4459.84] second is add cranberry juice if you're
[4457.44 - 4461.20] not overweight because what cranberries
[4459.84 - 4462.96] do is
[4461.20 - 4464.16] there's the bacteria that causes uti has
[4462.96 - 4466.24] a hook
[4464.16 - 4468.00] so that hook helps the bacteria to climb
[4466.24 - 4470.32] up the urethra which is your urinary
[4468.00 - 4472.00] canal so that bacteria goes up and
[4470.32 - 4473.92] causes a uti
[4472.00 - 4476.24] what you can do is you can take
[4473.92 - 4478.24] cranberries or cranberry extract or
[4476.24 - 4480.16] cranberry juice if you're not overweight
[4478.24 - 4482.96] because cranberry juice is high in sugar
[4480.16 - 4485.60] and add that to your protein diet and
[4482.96 - 4487.12] see whether it improves which vegetarian
[4485.60 - 4490.24] proteins i would recommend if you're a
[4487.12 - 4492.16] female soy protein works okay a brown
[4490.24 - 4493.84] rice protein works okay green pea
[4492.16 - 4496.72] protein works okay so let me give you
[4493.84 - 4499.28] another perspective in 2022
[4496.72 - 4501.44] now when we do microbiome testing and we
[4499.28 - 4503.92] do food allergy testing
[4501.44 - 4506.00] what we come up with is that when i've
[4503.92 - 4508.72] recommended a green pea protein
[4506.00 - 4511.20] plant-based isolate to my client
[4508.72 - 4514.80] my food allergy report says that my
[4511.20 - 4517.20] client is allergic to greenpeace
[4514.80 - 4520.16] so the biggest problem in today's world
[4517.20 - 4523.20] is this assumption that i need to take a
[4520.16 - 4525.68] protein supplement and without testing a
[4523.20 - 4527.44] food sensitivity or a food intolerance
[4525.68 - 4529.04] you douse yourself now how much of green
[4527.44 - 4531.36] peas can you eat
[4529.04 - 4533.52] you can eat a cup of green peas but one
[4531.36 - 4535.44] scoop of green pea protein isolate
[4533.52 - 4537.20] technically is equivalent to nearly six
[4535.44 - 4539.20] or seven cups of green peas who eats
[4537.20 - 4541.12] that sort of quantity so imagine the
[4539.20 - 4542.72] hypo allergic
[4541.12 - 4545.52] the allergic status that you're putting
[4542.72 - 4548.08] into your body so keep this in mind you
[4545.52 - 4550.88] do not need to douse
[4548.08 - 4552.64] high amounts of protein and trainers are
[4550.88 - 4554.64] recommending high amounts of protein my
[4552.64 - 4556.72] only request to you as a trainer if
[4554.64 - 4559.68] you're watching in is this
[4556.72 - 4562.32] check if your client agrees with that
[4559.68 - 4565.20] commercially produced protein
[4562.32 - 4566.80] which is devoid of carbohydrate and fat
[4565.20 - 4569.04] which is technically making it a
[4566.80 - 4570.72] processed and packaging food
[4569.04 - 4572.16] so because it's a processing and
[4570.72 - 4574.88] packaged food
[4572.16 - 4576.96] could there be a issue that you're
[4574.88 - 4578.96] causing by asking your client to douse
[4576.96 - 4580.88] with this could there be a issue and
[4578.96 - 4583.52] that's the reason why i say when you
[4580.88 - 4584.80] decide to do a aggressive fitness
[4583.52 - 4587.68] program
[4584.80 - 4589.20] get your diet with a professional done
[4587.68 - 4591.84] and even if your trainer is handling
[4589.20 - 4593.52] your diet ask for a blood test ask for a
[4591.84 - 4595.60] food allergy test if you have enough of
[4593.52 - 4598.48] money do the nutrition genetic test if
[4595.60 - 4600.32] you have even more money do a microbiome
[4598.48 - 4602.24] testing
[4600.32 - 4604.00] last year i did not buy a new car i
[4602.24 - 4606.24] chose to invest more money in
[4604.00 - 4609.12] understanding more about my microbiome
[4606.24 - 4611.60] more about my genetics more about how my
[4609.12 - 4613.92] fitness trainer can work with me better
[4611.60 - 4617.20] so i think that should be your focus in
[4613.92 - 4619.44] 2022 spend more on experiences and one
[4617.20 - 4622.16] of those experiences you yourself and
[4619.44 - 4623.68] that's very very very important
[4622.16 - 4626.16] somebody asked how can i reduce
[4623.68 - 4628.48] triglyceride levels again triglyceride
[4626.16 - 4630.72] levels i have seen amla
[4628.48 - 4634.24] as part of the diet works
[4630.72 - 4635.28] reduce your white flour and reduce your
[4634.24 - 4639.28] white
[4635.28 - 4641.52] hydrates white rice you will see a drop
[4639.28 - 4642.72] in the fructose and the triglyceride
[4641.52 - 4644.80] levels
[4642.72 - 4647.20] and also try and
[4644.80 - 4649.36] maybe work more with vegetables and less
[4647.20 - 4651.52] with fruits again on a case case-to-case
[4649.36 - 4654.00] basis i can work very aggressively with
[4651.52 - 4656.88] you and figure out what can be done
[4654.00 - 4659.52] sugar uh if money is not an issue for
[4656.88 - 4661.60] many of you and god of uh you're looking
[4659.52 - 4664.24] to spend on a vacation where you'd spend
[4661.60 - 4665.44] 30 40 50 000 rupees i would say garb do
[4664.24 - 4666.88] a blood test
[4665.44 - 4667.76] enroll with a nutritionist for three
[4666.88 - 4669.68] months
[4667.76 - 4672.32] and figure out what works very very well

[4745.44 - 4749.04] dalchini

[4749.04 - 4751.92] cinnamon
[4750.16 - 4754.08] morning after evening if you don't get
[4751.92 - 4757.20] acidity and you don't get mouth sores or
[4754.08 - 4760.56] any issues of acidity then cinnamon is
[4757.20 - 4762.88] known to improve in fat burning in
[4760.56 - 4764.88] certain individuals who are response
[4762.88 - 4768.00] whoever responds to what is called as
[4764.88 - 4771.36] cinnamon aldehyde which kind of mimics
[4768.00 - 4773.84] um an insulin booster it increases the
[4771.36 - 4775.92] receptors of uh insulin on the cell
[4773.84 - 4777.20] which allows for greater
[4775.92 - 4778.96] blood sugar
[4777.20 - 4780.40] betterment
[4778.96 - 4782.72] what which exercise would you recommend
[4780.40 - 4784.72] for fat loss so since the cardiologist
[4782.72 - 4786.40] is no longer here and the fitness expert
[4784.72 - 4787.68] is no longer here
[4786.40 - 4790.40] i have seen
[4787.68 - 4791.52] with hundreds of my clients including
[4790.40 - 4794.32] amir khan
[4791.52 - 4797.44] the recommendation has been to walk
[4794.32 - 4799.12] to lose visceral fat to walk to lose
[4797.44 - 4802.72] subcutaneous fat
[4799.12 - 4805.04] you need more than 15 000 steps a day
[4802.72 - 4807.76] you need more than 15 000 steps a day
[4805.04 - 4810.80] you need to walk because when you are in
[4807.76 - 4812.72] a low energy heart rate
[4810.80 - 4815.04] you utilize fat as a battery so let me
[4812.72 - 4817.84] explain this to you very easily okay
[4815.04 - 4821.04] so imagine uh the red pen as my
[4817.84 - 4824.24] carbohydrate and the orange pen as my uh
[4821.04 - 4825.20] as my fat so every muscle in the human
[4824.24 - 4827.68] body
[4825.20 - 4829.20] will utilize either carbohydrate or
[4827.68 - 4831.68] utilize fat
[4829.20 - 4834.24] when you do low intensity activity jaadu
[4831.68 - 4837.12] pocha walking in your house going up the
[4834.24 - 4840.40] stairs neat non-exercise adaptive
[4837.12 - 4842.72] thermogenesis you utilize more amount of
[4840.40 - 4844.72] fat up to 70 percent of the energy
[4842.72 - 4847.44] requirement during that period comes
[4844.72 - 4849.52] from fat and 30 from carbohydrate now
[4847.44 - 4851.92] the moment you start running and your
[4849.52 - 4854.32] heart is not conditioned your heart is
[4851.92 - 4856.64] not conditioned your heart rate goes up
[4854.32 - 4858.24] and then you start using more and more
[4856.64 - 4862.00] carbohydrate
[4858.24 - 4862.80] as a substrate and lesser and lesser fat
[4862.00 - 4864.48] so
[4862.80 - 4868.16] the secret
[4864.48 - 4869.36] to fat burning is slow intensity for
[4868.16 - 4872.16] your heart
[4869.36 - 4874.24] but longer duration to recruit the fat
[4872.16 - 4877.84] burning battery and this is the
[4874.24 - 4879.92] essential secret in addition to uh
[4877.84 - 4881.52] monitoring your diet so very very
[4879.92 - 4884.56] important if you want to do a nutrition
[4881.52 - 4887.44] plan with me um you can you can do it at
[4884.56 - 4888.96] the koa nutrition clinics uh it's so so
[4887.44 - 4891.44] important that
[4888.96 - 4893.68] i feel that in 2022
[4891.44 - 4895.84] spend some money on your body towards
[4893.68 - 4898.80] you know getting healthier
[4895.84 - 4901.60] um suji asked should i avoid
[4898.80 - 4904.16] gluten content when i have a thyroid
[4901.60 - 4907.04] at the face value
[4904.16 - 4909.76] suji what i would say to you
[4907.04 - 4911.84] suji if i can make a joke
[4909.76 - 4913.44] you get gluten-free suji and you get
[4911.84 - 4914.88] normal sooji which is made from rava
[4913.44 - 4916.80] which is made from wheat
[4914.88 - 4918.96] traditionally soji in india was always
[4916.80 - 4920.72] in south india made with rice and that's
[4918.96 - 4922.40] why people didn't have problem i think a
[4920.72 - 4924.40] lot of suji that is made today is made
[4922.40 - 4926.56] with gluten-based wheat because maida is
[4924.40 - 4928.08] cheaper
[4926.56 - 4930.64] so so so
[4928.08 - 4933.12] yeah my my information is if you do a
[4930.64 - 4935.44] gene test and you're gluten sensitive
[4933.12 - 4939.28] you have the dna in you then i would
[4935.44 - 4940.40] advise you to go off gluten but also
[4939.28 - 4943.76] look at
[4940.40 - 4946.32] tsh thyroid stimulating hormone requires
[4943.76 - 4948.16] 10 nutrients for its functioning tsh is
[4946.32 - 4950.16] situated released from the pituitary
[4948.16 - 4952.64] which goes and acts on your thyroid t3
[4950.16 - 4954.16] t4 but people immediately say oh tsa is
[4952.64 - 4956.40] not working let's take a medicine so you
[4954.16 - 4958.96] go directly over here instead i'm saying
[4956.40 - 4961.84] what are those 10 nutrients for your tsh
[4958.96 - 4963.68] to work well my wife when i married her
[4961.84 - 4965.84] had thyroid for the longest period today
[4963.68 - 4967.28] she takes not a single medication for
[4965.84 - 4970.16] her thyroid
[4967.28 - 4973.36] gluten free and those 10 micronutrients
[4970.16 - 4974.72] of which vitamin d vitamin b12
[4973.36 - 4978.56] vitamin c
[4974.72 - 4981.28] chromium selenium magnesium zinc
[4978.56 - 4982.64] and an amino acid which i can't forget
[4981.28 - 4985.60] which i'm forgetting right now but there
[4982.64 - 4986.80] are 10 micronutrients that are highly
[4985.60 - 4989.36] required
[4986.80 - 4990.80] for your thyroid tsh functioning and i
[4989.36 - 4992.24] think our nutrition is lacking and
[4990.80 - 4993.84] that's why it goes
[4992.24 - 4996.32] uh uh
[4993.84 - 4998.32] you know bad anushka saying i try to eat
[4996.32 - 5000.64] clean most of the times but then i'm not
[4998.32 - 5002.08] able to achieve my flawless skin goals
[5000.64 - 5005.84] though i have good genetics i have
[5002.08 - 5005.84] omega-3 and vitamin c and water
[5006.08 - 5010.00] so
[5007.60 - 5012.16] if if so when anushka sharma the film
[5010.00 - 5015.04] star came to me the whole perspective
[5012.16 - 5016.64] was i need filters of testing
[5015.04 - 5018.48] blood test
[5016.64 - 5020.96] food intolerance test
[5018.48 - 5022.40] genetic test microbiome test put all of
[5020.96 - 5024.40] these filters figure out what are the
[5022.40 - 5026.80] foods you cannot eat the moment you
[5024.40 - 5029.36] start moving those foods out so unusual
[5026.80 - 5032.08] if you see i have had adult acne all my
[5029.36 - 5033.68] life so i've got poked up skin now as a
[5032.08 - 5035.52] teenager if somebody met me and told me
[5033.68 - 5037.84] ryan you are gluten sensitive i would
[5035.52 - 5040.00] have been like okay let's try it but in
[5037.84 - 5043.04] 1996 when i was in medical college and
[5040.00 - 5044.36] had pimples nobody told me about it but
[5043.04 - 5047.04] in
[5044.36 - 5049.92] 2011 when i did the gene testing it came
[5047.04 - 5052.96] back hey mr gohan fernando you are not
[5049.92 - 5052.96] supposed to eat gluten
[5053.28 - 5058.32] i stopped it and i never had adult acne
[5056.00 - 5059.20] for 20 days of stopping gluten and i'm
[5058.32 - 5060.32] like
[5059.20 - 5062.24] whoa
[5060.32 - 5063.52] i have all my skin drying or my pimples
[5062.24 - 5065.92] are disappearing
[5063.52 - 5068.16] and i went on to a six month gluten free
[5065.92 - 5070.88] and i didn't have a pimple and my wife's
[5068.16 - 5073.36] birthday was on the 27th and i ate
[5070.88 - 5076.56] gluten cake that came for her i popped
[5073.36 - 5079.36] in a gluten enzyme tablet but i got a
[5076.56 - 5081.52] stye on my eye if you can see over here
[5079.36 - 5083.28] i never get stars never
[5081.52 - 5085.52] i used to get it when i was taking
[5083.28 - 5087.52] gluten and i was like ah it's the gluten
[5085.52 - 5089.20] it's the gluten in the cake
[5087.52 - 5090.80] maybe it's the milk i ate a lot of
[5089.20 - 5092.40] christmas chocolates
[5090.80 - 5094.48] so skin
[5092.40 - 5096.64] what you know if i take my skin and i
[5094.48 - 5099.36] fold it on the inside
[5096.64 - 5102.16] it becomes my throat my stomach my
[5099.36 - 5104.08] intestines it becomes everything
[5102.16 - 5105.76] so what kujali and damages happening out
[5104.08 - 5108.32] there comes up on your skin so if you
[5105.76 - 5110.24] want to glow you got to change your diet
[5108.32 - 5112.40] i would suggest do the correct anushka
[5110.24 - 5114.40] do the correct diagnostics figure out
[5112.40 - 5116.48] the kujili molecules get them out of
[5114.40 - 5118.40] your life and then put in the molecules
[5116.48 - 5120.72] that are good doing very well for you
[5118.40 - 5122.72] you've written omega 3 i've had one
[5120.72 - 5126.64] client once in my life when we gave her
[5122.72 - 5129.68] omega-3 she got worse skin
[5126.64 - 5132.16] omega-3 is brilliant omega-3 is really
[5129.68 - 5135.84] really brilliant for good health
[5132.16 - 5138.48] but go figure not all not all foods fit
[5135.84 - 5140.88] for the same person in the same
[5138.48 - 5142.96] what you say tenacity or same action and
[5140.88 - 5145.20] that's why has formed koa nutrition kua
[5142.96 - 5148.16] in latin means incapacity so figure out
[5145.20 - 5149.04] what foods uh you can uh

[5179.44 - 5183.52] not to have gluten in a diet for better
[5181.28 - 5186.40] athletic performance i'm writing a book
[5183.52 - 5188.32] next year on why wheat why we should not
[5186.40 - 5190.32] eat it even if you're not gluten
[5188.32 - 5191.76] sensitive there's enough proof in the
[5190.32 - 5194.00] pudding which is a simple thing all of
[5191.76 - 5196.32] you could do
[5194.00 - 5199.28] for 20 days don't eat any wheat waste
[5196.32 - 5201.60] product check your resting heart rate
[5199.28 - 5202.64] 20 days don't eat any gluten in your
[5201.60 - 5205.44] diet
[5202.64 - 5207.36] if your resting heart rate comes down
[5205.44 - 5208.96] gluten is a culprit in life try that as
[5207.36 - 5211.12] an experiment if you have the patience
[5208.96 - 5212.56] and time which are the best cooking oils
[5211.12 - 5214.80] to be used in a home
[5212.56 - 5216.72] hey there is no best cooking oil to use
[5214.80 - 5218.24] on your whole it is bio individual in my
[5216.72 - 5220.40] house there are two bottles of oil which
[5218.24 - 5222.64] has a man picture and a woman picture my
[5220.40 - 5224.96] wife is from the east coast of india i'm
[5222.64 - 5227.12] from the west coast of india completely
[5224.96 - 5229.04] genetic different profiles in terms of
[5227.12 - 5231.28] coconut oil works for me mustard oil
[5229.04 - 5232.96] works for her olive oil works for her
[5231.28 - 5235.12] olive oil doesn't work for me so you got
[5232.96 - 5237.12] to figure it out from a genetic
[5235.12 - 5239.60] perspective
[5237.12 - 5242.48] is soy fit soya milk really good for a
[5239.60 - 5245.44] 10 year old who competes
[5242.48 - 5248.48] near if your kid is a boy i would not
[5245.44 - 5250.80] give soya milk more than twice a week
[5248.48 - 5252.48] i'd have to work with my dietitian for
[5250.80 - 5254.80] your kid
[5252.48 - 5258.32] in terms of what could be the other
[5254.80 - 5261.04] dietary natural alternatives
[5258.32 - 5264.16] and if your child is a girl then soya
[5261.04 - 5266.00] milk is okay but these commercial
[5264.16 - 5268.32] companies i'm not too happy with the
[5266.00 - 5270.80] amount of sugar that they put into it so
[5268.32 - 5273.28] what i would do is i would go more with
[5270.80 - 5275.52] like tempeh which is fermented soya
[5273.28 - 5277.60] which tastes and feels like paneer and
[5275.52 - 5280.40] make natural dishes like that or make
[5277.60 - 5282.88] like a cottage cheese rasmalai
[5280.40 - 5284.72] but the rasmalai is is replaced with the
[5282.88 - 5285.76] tempe and it comes out really nicely
[5284.72 - 5288.40] just
[5285.76 - 5290.24] just replace paneer with with uh with
[5288.40 - 5291.68] with the with the tempe and you could
[5290.24 - 5293.20] make a sweet dish for your kid to get
[5291.68 - 5296.00] more protein
[5293.20 - 5298.08] is amway plant protein good um i used to
[5296.00 - 5299.60] work for amway many many years ago in
[5298.08 - 5301.92] the past life
[5299.60 - 5305.44] i don't believe any company is creating
[5301.92 - 5307.60] a bad product i believe you individually
[5305.44 - 5309.84] might select a good company's product
[5307.60 - 5311.60] that is bad for your gut
[5309.84 - 5314.08] you want me to repeat that
[5311.60 - 5315.60] i believe there is no bad company out
[5314.08 - 5318.16] there that creates a nutritional
[5315.60 - 5319.68] supplement what i do genuinely believe
[5318.16 - 5322.56] is that people
[5319.68 - 5323.76] choose these good products but that
[5322.56 - 5324.52] product
[5323.76 - 5327.92] is
[5324.52 - 5331.92] physiologically bad for your body
[5327.92 - 5332.45] so it's no one size that fits all okay
[5331.92 - 5334.40] um
[5332.45 - 5336.16] [Music]

[5435.60 - 5441.36] consider dietitians as angels
[5439.04 - 5443.76] who are put on this planet
[5441.36 - 5445.60] to change the way you eat
[5443.76 - 5446.80] whilst you will have a devil and you

[5446.80 - 5451.36] an angel on your shoulder you should eat
[5449.36 - 5452.64] that cake you should not eat that cake
[5451.36 - 5454.88] you should eat that cake you should not
[5452.64 - 5457.44] eat that cake well it's not two kicks
[5454.88 - 5460.16] it's two personalities inside of you
[5457.44 - 5462.64] by going in for nutritional counseling
[5460.16 - 5465.04] sessions and just talking to a person
[5462.64 - 5466.88] one on one you will change your behavior
[5465.04 - 5468.96] have you ever remembered in school when
[5466.88 - 5470.88] your teacher took you aside and said
[5468.96 - 5472.96] ryan you're not studying hard enough if
[5470.88 - 5476.48] you studied harder and did not look at
[5472.96 - 5478.72] all the girls you would be a much more
[5476.48 - 5480.16] smarter student
[5478.72 - 5482.48] i got that advice i didn't listen to
[5480.16 - 5484.24] much of it maybe if that teacher had
[5482.48 - 5485.36] persevered a little bit more i wouldn't
[5484.24 - 5486.88] be looking at the girl so much and
[5485.36 - 5489.44] studied a little harder you know you get
[5486.88 - 5491.84] the point so i want you to enroll with
[5489.44 - 5493.76] my nutritionist with my dietitians
[5491.84 - 5497.68] because after school you're not
[5493.76 - 5499.04] accountable to anybody think about it
[5497.68 - 5501.12] after 22 years of age are you
[5499.04 - 5502.64] accountable to anybody you have your own
[5501.12 - 5503.92] salary you do everything yeah once you
[5502.64 - 5505.92] get married you're accountable to your
[5503.92 - 5507.84] spouse your better half mostly husbands
[5505.92 - 5509.84] are accountable to their wives
[5507.84 - 5511.20] i don't think it's vice versa we may not
[5509.84 - 5513.20] the home ministers finance ministers
[5511.20 - 5515.04] they control everything if you're a guy
[5513.20 - 5516.32] who's uh controlling everything please

[5516.32 - 5521.20] do but jokes apart jokes apart we don't
[5518.56 - 5522.80] report into anyone
[5521.20 - 5524.72] so what is the reason that you will

[5524.72 - 5527.92] exercise plan ghanta you will do
[5526.32 - 5529.44] anything nothing you will do after this
[5527.92 - 5531.12] seminar is over it's gone it's over
[5529.44 - 5532.64] maybe some 10 15 people are watching

[5532.64 - 5536.32] do this stuff but i do this stuff
[5534.00 - 5538.48] because i'm hoping that one person turns
[5536.32 - 5541.04] out to be fardeen khan who watched a
[5538.48 - 5542.24] video of mine and then met dr ali irani

[5556.64 - 5561.36] word of wisdom
