[46.88 - 53.04] researchers analyze data from over
[49.40 - 55.52] 80,000 participants age 30 and above
[53.04 - 56.92] across 14 years their mission to
[55.52 - 59.48] understand how different physical

[74.64 - 80.56] racket Sports so powerful for longevity
[78.12 - 83.52] it is actually a mix of intense physical
[80.56 - 85.76] exercise and sharp mental engagement and
[83.52 - 87.96] here's the science behind it number one
[85.76 - 89.96] the cardiovascular health racket sports
[87.96 - 92.20] like tennis and squash are inherently
[89.96 - 94.48] fast-paced involving quick burst of
[92.20 - 96.08] activity followed by short rest periods
[94.48 - 98.28] this is a form of interval training
[96.08 - 100.20] which is highly effective at elevating
[98.28 - 103.00] heart rate and strengthening the heart
[100.20 - 105.24] muscle over time this reduces your risk
[103.00 - 107.56] of heart disease by improving blood
[105.24 - 109.76] circulation and lowering blood pressure
[107.56 - 112.84] plus these Sports also improve your
[109.76 - 115.52] lipid profile by increasing good HDL
[112.84 - 117.76] cholesterol while decreasing the bad LDL
[115.52 - 119.52] cholesterol the result a stronger heart
[117.76 - 121.68] and lower risk of heart attack strokes
[119.52 - 123.52] and their cardiovascular conditions the
[121.68 - 125.20] second benefit is Weight Management
[123.52 - 128.04] maintaining a healthy weight is crucial
[125.20 - 129.56] for longevity and Racket Sports excel at
[128.04 - 131.32] burning calories did you know that
[129.56 - 133.80] playing tennis can burn between 400 to
[131.32 - 136.00] 600 calories per hour the combination of
[133.80 - 138.68] aerobic that is cardio and anerobic
[136.00 - 141.20] strength exercises in these Sports

[141.20 - 146.24] building keeping your body composition
[143.88 - 148.56] in check so the key here is in reducing
[146.24 - 150.64] the risk of chronic conditions like type
[148.56 - 152.68] 2 diabetes maybe High hypertension and
[150.64 - 155.52] even heart disease the third point is
[152.68 - 158.92] increased bone density and strength as
[155.52 - 161.40] we age bone density naturally decreases
[158.92 - 163.20] leading to conditions like osteoporosis
[161.40 - 165.16] racket sports are weightbearing
[163.20 - 166.84] activities meaning they require to
[165.16 - 168.76] support your body weight during play
[166.84 - 170.92] this repeated impact from running
[168.76 - 173.00] jumping and changing directions
[170.92 - 175.04] stimulate bone growth and strengthen
[173.00 - 177.00] your skeletal frame studies even show
[175.04 - 179.52] that tennis players have greater bone
[177.00 - 181.64] density in their dominant arm compared
[179.52 - 183.40] to the non-dominant arm proof of these
[181.64 - 185.56] Sports powerful effect on the bone
[183.40 - 187.52] health number four muscle strength and
[185.56 - 189.28] coordination racket Sports involve a
[187.52 - 190.88] wide range of movements that Target
[189.28 - 192.24] multiple muscle groups you're sprinting
[190.88 - 193.80] lunging jumping and hitting the ball
[192.24 - 195.68] with Precision which works your legs
[193.80 - 197.36] core and upper body this not only builds
[195.68 - 199.16] muscle strength but also enhances
[197.36 - 201.08] coordination and balance this is crucial
[199.16 - 203.92] for maintaining physical function and
[201.08 - 206.24] Independence as you age stronger muscles
[203.92 - 208.36] also reduce the risk of Falls a common
[206.24 - 210.36] cause of injury in older adults the
[208.36 - 212.40] fifth benefit is the cognitive benefits
[210.36 - 214.52] and mental sharpness racket Sports
[212.40 - 216.48] demand mental agility whether you're
[214.52 - 218.20] strategizing in a game of tennis or

[221.92 - 226.00] actually the key to maintaining
[224.00 - 227.72] cognitive health and protecting against
[226.00 - 229.84] neurogenerative diseases like
[227.72 - 231.60] Alzheimer's Parkinson's and many other
[229.84 - 233.16] mental problems the combination of
[231.60 - 235.68] physical and mental exercise makes
[233.16 - 237.44] racket Sports in my opinion a very
[235.68 - 240.28] powerful tool for keeping your mind
[237.44 - 242.32] sharp as you age number six and talks
[240.28 - 244.08] about this stress reduction and
[242.32 - 245.68] emotional well-being the fastpaced
[244.08 - 247.28] nature of Racket Sports can be a great
[245.68 - 249.64] stress reliever physical activity
[247.28 - 251.44] triggers the release of endorphins those
[249.64 - 253.32] Feelgood chemicals in your brain that
[251.44 - 255.00] help reduce stress and boost your mood
[253.32 - 257.12] no wonder so many of us run to the club

[258.76 - 262.20] tennis or joining squash League can
[260.40 - 264.24] foster a sense of community and reduce

[267.92 - 271.76] contributes to overall mental well-being
[269.96 - 272.92] and longivity now put all of this
[271.76 - 276.04] together and it's no surprise that
[272.92 - 278.04] racket Sports have a 56% lower risk of
[276.04 - 279.48] death from cardiovascular disease as
[278.04 - 281.48] highlighted in the British Journal of
[279.48 - 283.52] sports medicine study the Synergy of

[301.20 - 305.12] joint but it lacks the weightbearing
[303.32 - 307.96] components essential for bone health
[305.12 - 310.12] cycling great for cardio but doesn't
[307.96 - 311.96] offer the same mental engagement or
[310.12 - 313.76] social interaction as racket Sports
[311.96 - 315.52] aerobics effective for fitness and
[313.76 - 317.28] muscle tone but may not provide the
[315.52 - 319.04] cognitive challenge or strategic
