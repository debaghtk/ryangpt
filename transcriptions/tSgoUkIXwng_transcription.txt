Transcript: which asked for monthly assessment quarterly assessment and annual assessment this is from a nutrition perspective now what do you ask is a coach you asked my dear friend you are with me playing what is your weight this month keep a track record what is my weight next month and like that whenever players come to me I have 12 months of data as a coach if your player is losing weight alarm bells should go off you need to see your nutritionist by the way this happens mostly in the girls because they are very conscious about your figure so they don't eat and they train a lot so they are burning muscle they are not burning fat keep this in mind so when you take this weight don't take a simple weighing scale it cost about $100 for a nice weighing scale which will measure your muscle and fat percentage or but mr. Fernando there is something called the DEXA scan that is $100,000 machine or we need that in our tennis facility I not required simple wings skill if you have data with you even if it has a 5% error it is better than having no data at all because as a coach if you come to know that muscle is dropping every tournament or every training after 3 months what should you do you should see go to the nutritionist go to the physiotherapist go to whoever you have to go to because something we are doing and you're losing muscle second thing don't check muscle check fat percentage these weighing scales are so modern now you step on them even your a your weight and my weight it will take so if you don't want to buy for children buy one for yourself at least your health will be good ok so fat percentage in Indian gene deposits around the stomach so in this part of the world we have heavy deposition on the midriff I am NOT talking about all people so today by Jamie small children 8 to 16 year olds have sixteen year olds coming tall 6 feet very good but when they stand at the weighing scale visceral fat visceral fat is a fat near the organs 5 6 I have a German player John placed and the net zero because the genetics is different the diet is different so keep that in mind okay water the weighing scales now measure percentage of water 60% is a normal level I recently had a 12 year old girl when she stepped on the scale it came error I was like huh took it out change the battery sister up arrow took it out not working so fortunately I have three for counseling rooms I went and got the other weighing scale and put it so error so now I was like you know one thing just hydrate well so what did you do she said yesterday I played singles and doubles blah blah blah it was four hours of playing and everything so she came back the next day and she stood on it and it said 55% water that means the previous day the scale was not able to read and I don't know for what reason I don't have an answer but it gave me a thought process when players are playing matches back-to-back Monday to Thursday why they losing in semifinals and finals because they are dehydrated internally the cell has become like a there's a gray pot I know what is grape in Hindi ungood are draped grape job Tsukasa hoja Tito Cobb anti-christmas to tomorrow brain Miyazaki's miss Jota keep the
