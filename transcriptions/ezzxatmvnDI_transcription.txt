take this from me I've worked with celebrities I've given people six packs for movies but those are occupational hazards and there are normal people like you and me that have to take one to two years to lose weight the weight you need to lose is fat fat percentage needs to drop you need to know your genetics you need to know your blood biochemistry therefore my sincerely appeal to you is get in touch with the dietitian or nutritionist and plan on a slow and steady plan because that is the correct way
