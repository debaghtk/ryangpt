[0.08 - 4.72] hey guys if you're not able to watch my
[2.28 - 7.12] long form content of podcast here are
[4.72 - 9.20] some short form clips for you to enjoy
[7.12 - 11.40] there are a lot of myths about skin care
[9.20 - 13.04] there are a lot of certified influencers
[11.40 - 14.92] that are there now today on Instagram
[13.04 - 16.80] which come and troll you and me and they
[14.92 - 18.48] think they know it everything they just
[16.80 - 19.80] have a camera and then they have a mic
[18.48 - 21.28] and then they're talking about as if
[19.80 - 23.32] they know the world but they don't have
[21.28 - 26.40] a clinical practice scary what are some
[23.32 - 28.56] of the common myths that are out there
[26.40 - 31.32] or Hocus Pocus stuff that makes your
[28.56 - 34.16] blood boil when you hear about it see
[31.32 - 36.76] today I should say the bloggers also
[34.16 - 38.20] read up a lot so they sound intelligent
[36.76 - 40.52] and they tell you the right things so
[38.20 - 42.08] they may not be much depth if you really
[40.52 - 43.80] to to sound intelligent but you don't
[42.08 - 45.52] have the clinical practice no depth and
[43.80 - 46.72] no clinical practice no degrees so
[45.52 - 49.36] that's something which you need to be
[46.72 - 51.68] very clear of who you're listening to or
[49.36 - 53.16] who you're who you're even as a
[51.68 - 54.56] completely qualified doctor there are a
[53.16 - 56.84] lot of times people get angry with me
[54.56 - 58.44] because I don't suggest a product but I
[56.84 - 61.28] can't how will I suggest a product
[58.44 - 62.80] online which one is the best sunscreen
[61.28 - 64.32] what kind of a question is that I can't
[62.80 - 65.96] tell you because I don't know your skin
[64.32 - 67.76] type I don't know your sun exposure I
[65.96 - 70.44] don't know where you live Ryan Fernando
[67.76 - 71.56] can you recommend a diet plan yeah hello
[70.44 - 72.92] I don't know your gender I don't know
[71.56 - 74.16] your age I don't know your body fat
[72.92 - 75.44] percentage and then I'm angry you only
[74.16 - 77.68] do it for celebrities you don't do it
[75.44 - 80.72] for me you can't do free for me I'm a
[77.68 - 82.92] poor person and everything so the same
[80.72 - 84.12] same page and then something I would
[82.92 - 87.32] have applied they say which one are you
[84.12 - 89.48] applying but that's for my skin so like
[87.32 - 91.72] that what boils me is when people end up
[89.48 - 94.32] coming so SK is bioindividual
[91.72 - 95.72] very very so one person could use a
[94.32 - 97.48] sunscreen and another person could use a
[95.72 - 99.88] sunscreen and they could have two
[97.48 - 101.44] different effects on the skin so even
[99.88 - 102.96] you're like looking at the skin and
[101.44 - 106.04] saying okay you can't use this sunscreen
[102.96 - 109.40] you got to use this sunscreen yeah ah I
[106.04 - 110.80] just thought it was SPF SPF is a general
[109.40 - 112.80] thing there are many factors that you
[110.80 - 113.68] see in a sunscreen SPF is one tell us a
[112.80 - 114.92] little bit about it because you got a
[113.68 - 116.52] lot of sun is going to it's only going
[114.92 - 118.24] to get hotter heat wave is coming up
[116.52 - 122.04] heat wave is coming up
[118.24 - 125.44] so right from the kids to older people
[122.04 - 127.44] talk to us about skincare routine um you
[125.44 - 129.88] know the free tips to everyone out there
[127.44 - 132.32] who listening in we got Dr Rashmi in
[129.88 - 134.48] here to me she's this she's the verat
[132.32 - 135.96] kohi of Dermatology so she's like
[134.48 - 137.84] hitting everything out of the let's get
[135.96 - 139.64] some free tips from her what what would
[137.84 - 142.88] you recommend from a skincare routine
[139.64 - 146.00] point of view I remember her hearing ctm
[142.88 - 148.16] yeah cleans started off in life yeah CM
[146.00 - 150.92] but I'm too lazy to do it so where would
[148.16 - 153.48] you take skincare routine for one of us
[150.92 - 156.92] so like you said the first thing for
[153.48 - 159.96] skin is hygiene I would start right from
[156.92 - 163.08] there so your scalp hygiene is included
[159.96 - 164.84] in skin hygiene so very very important
[163.08 - 167.60] so you need to have a clean a lot of
[164.84 - 169.32] times teenagers come to me with acne and
[167.60 - 171.72] these days teenagers are so paranoid
[169.32 - 173.68] about losing their hair mhm there's also
[171.72 - 175.76] early graying early balding that we see
[173.68 - 178.08] right so they are all oh yeah Big T as
[175.76 - 180.88] compared to like 10 years ago this is
[178.08 - 182.84] huge right now so therefore for they
[180.88 - 185.36] scared to wash their hair they think
[182.84 - 187.88] washing hair leads to hair fall which is
[185.36 - 190.80] a big myth not at all keep your scalp
[187.88 - 194.64] clean say that again from me washing
[190.80 - 197.32] hair will not lead to hairfall at all in
[194.64 - 200.20] fact accumulation of your dandruff your
[197.32 - 203.68] sebum your dirt on your scalp will lead
[200.20 - 207.60] to inflammation which leads to hair
[203.68 - 209.64] fall that's a sixer right now yeah
[207.60 - 211.04] because everyone's saying today I don't
[209.64 - 213.40] want wash my hair don't wash your hair
[211.04 - 215.36] and everything no not the doctor says
[213.40 - 219.80] you got to wash your hair but how do we
[215.36 - 223.80] do it yes so depends on scalp type okay
[219.80 - 225.20] so if you have a very dry scalp how do
[223.80 - 227.32] you know the difference between dry
[225.20 - 229.68] scalp and a and dandruff is my NE is
[227.32 - 231.48] your next question so I'm preempting it
[229.68 - 233.88] so if you have a dry scalp you will know
[231.48 - 235.52] that the day you wash your hair mhm
[233.88 - 237.20] immediately once you dry it it starts
[235.52 - 238.52] getting flaky it start getting itchy and
[237.20 - 241.20] a little
[238.52 - 242.92] sensitive um and then if someone kind of
[241.20 - 245.40] opens up your hair and sees the scalp it
[242.92 - 247.60] may feel a little red as well so now
[245.40 - 250.48] this you know is dry scalp
[247.60 - 252.92] flakiness so then you don't wash your
[250.48 - 255.04] hair every day you can wash it alternate
[252.92 - 257.44] day so that some oil can accumulate
[255.04 - 259.96] there wait for it to kind of accumulate
[257.44 - 262.96] but if you have an oily scalp then you
[259.96 - 266.12] can wash your scalp every single day
[262.96 - 268.12] with your chosen shampoo now if you do
[266.12 - 269.72] have dandruff then again you need to
[268.12 - 273.52] wash it every single day so you're not
[269.72 - 276.20] not accumulating the yeast and the fat
[273.52 - 277.80] of your skin which is with the skin of
[276.20 - 279.24] the scalp is putting out that's the food
[277.80 - 280.92] for the East so you're going to kill
[279.24 - 284.28] both so you're going to wash it off
[280.92 - 286.16] every day this is what you do now if you
[284.28 - 289.24] have we only talking about scalp right
[286.16 - 291.20] now so if you have a scalp a certain way
[289.24 - 293.96] and a hair a certain way most people end
[291.20 - 297.08] up asking do my scalp scalp is oily but
[293.96 - 299.72] my hair is dry now what do I do so
[297.08 - 302.72] that's when you wash your scalp with the
[299.72 - 305.24] said shampoo every single day and you
[302.72 - 308.00] don't have to shampoo your hair at all
[305.24 - 311.76] hair is dry hair is not dirty we're all
[308.00 - 313.68] in AC closed environments so you wash
[311.76 - 316.48] your hair just so that you get some
[313.68 - 317.96] hydration and shine on it once in a week
[316.48 - 319.44] with the shampoo but you shampoo your
[317.96 - 322.40] scalp every day and put conditioner for
[319.44 - 324.04] the hair and come out of the bath so
[322.40 - 326.68] this is what you would wash your hair
[324.04 - 328.84] and your scalp separately anti- dander
[326.68 - 332.12] shampoo can only go on the scalp but a
[328.84 - 333.92] hydrating shampoo can go on your hair so
[332.12 - 336.48] that's how you look for hair and scalp
[333.92 - 338.64] shampoo so that is scalp hygiene now
[336.48 - 340.12] skin hygiene depends again on your skin
[338.64 - 342.96] type now whatever is your skin you're
[340.12 - 344.88] having a bath I prefer a liquid soap to
[342.96 - 346.96] a solid soap only because you don't keep
[344.88 - 348.28] pulling applying putting it back and
[346.96 - 349.48] again picking up applying putting it
[348.28 - 352.64] back what's the
[349.48 - 354.28] logic there is it's a soap right and
[352.64 - 355.80] you're touching it on your skin there
[354.28 - 357.56] could be germs there could be dust
[355.80 - 359.36] accumulating do we wash our soap before
[357.56 - 361.92] really using two three people might use
[359.36 - 363.76] the same same thing in the house I just
[361.92 - 366.44] feel it is a
[363.76 - 368.56] little unhygienic concept about it
[366.44 - 372.16] though the whole world Liv my brain
[368.56 - 373.72] going like yeah I feel uh personally
[372.16 - 375.48] it's it's it's not something that I want
[373.72 - 377.24] to touch put back touch put back so it's
[375.48 - 379.00] easy to take it out of a dispenser use
[377.24 - 381.68] it and you're done what is sitting
[379.00 - 383.96] inside is still untouched right true so
[381.68 - 386.84] true and if 10 people in a house use one
[383.96 - 389.00] bathroom for example not all 10 are
[386.84 - 391.08] using the same soap and putting it back
[389.00 - 392.80] so you and the soap dishes sitting
[391.08 - 394.24] sometimes I've seen there'll be a soap
[392.80 - 397.12] dish there'll be a soap with a lot of
[394.24 - 399.00] water in it so nobody is even cleaning
[397.12 - 401.68] and emptying that so I find that whole
[399.00 - 403.48] thing a little unhygienic so it's easier
[401.68 - 405.40] for something coming out of a tube or a
[403.48 - 407.44] dispenser where you know what's inside
[405.40 - 409.56] is clean so that's the bathing ritual
[407.44 - 411.72] with bathing ritual and bathing how many
[409.56 - 413.28] times twice is okay more than that is
[411.72 - 416.16] not good for skin because you're ripping
[413.28 - 418.28] your own oils off I have a lot of
[416.16 - 420.92] athletes and they train like three four
[418.28 - 424.76] times a day wow okay so this has been my
[420.92 - 427.68] advice to them use the soap once a day
[424.76 - 429.48] on the entire body and in your private
[427.68 - 431.60] parts underarms and all all the body
[429.48 - 434.52] folds all the body folds you do that for
[431.60 - 436.12] body order and the that is two baths and
[434.52 - 438.64] in third or fourth B just use plain
[436.12 - 440.16] water is that okay that's okay maybe if
[438.64 - 442.64] they're athletes you may still want them
[440.16 - 444.48] to use whatever little soaps even at
[442.64 - 445.96] their body folds each time they have a
[444.48 - 448.12] bath because they to sweat it out
[445.96 - 451.80] correct but other than that yeah soap
[448.12 - 453.52] only once okay awesome awesome is there
[451.80 - 456.60] any other skincare routine that we now
[453.52 - 458.36] get into Beyond bathing yeah so I think
[456.60 - 461.04] hygiene wise this is what that you need
[458.36 - 462.64] to be very careful about and washing the
[461.04 - 464.44] face would again be not more than two
[462.64 - 466.96] times if you really have an oily skin
[464.44 - 468.32] than the third time I've seen a lot of
[466.96 - 470.36] people say oh but I'm just washing with
[468.32 - 472.92] water hey guys if you've enjoyed this
