Transcript: so um devika why did you decide to do a genetic nutrition testing for i can what was the predominant reason see i go to his pediatrician and they recommend me food food stuff to eat but more or less i'm very confused what to give him because they all give me conflicting foods to eat when i go to the emergency one and to my normal pediatrician like last week i went for uh because he was unwell and i asked her whether i could give her give him banana and i understand that banana is not supposed to be given when you have cold so the potassium you know the pediatric doctor at the emergency said that you can give the banana also when i was talking to suharsani who was the pediatric nutritionist for nutrition she recommended the genetic test to let me know whether what kind of foodstuff that i can give him at this small child you know in terms of the protein carbs and fat percentage which can be perfected right away uh rather than later and you know it also gives me the input of a lifetime so i can use it i can so you don't feel that spending 30 000 rupees on a genetic test is expensive no i don't think it is expansion because when you see that it is 30 000 rupees over what value that you get over a lifetime it's actually extremely cheap uh overall let's look at it this way it is 20 30 000 now it might be very very expensive tomorrow so it's much more cheaper than doing it today than doing it so ask me as a pediatric nutritionist uh what takeaways will you get from the genetic test see uh the genetic test is going to tell me uh what icon is going to have to eat in terms of the vitamins and they're going to have to eat in terms of this diet and um like you all know genetic test is a one-time test it's not gonna change today he's seven months of age it's not going to change when you become seven years so it's all about what he has to eat and what are his requirements now this generic test tells me his vitamin profile which means it tells me is vitamin b how are they in his body genetically is it going to be high is it going to be enough or is it going to be less so if i know at the age of 7 months that his vitamin b for example is going to be a little low i make sure that his diet has adequate amount of vitamin b coming in not only today but throughout his lifetime similarly it also tells me about his um you know for the mother's point of view it tells him about the brain performance the memory the reading and all of that but the type of exercise that he is going to benefit from genetically so if the mom knows that he's going to be good with cardiac i mean with the arabic exercises then she's going to make sure she puts him into a sport which has such kind of a training routine don't you feel it's too early at seven months to do the gene testing why is it too early it is not really because it's a one time test i can i'd rather know in the beginning of everything rather know it later on uh when i am not able to be able to change it like i believe that what you teach your child today is what he's going to implement later on at the age of five if you do this test your child is going to be the last person to eat what you ask him to eat uh you know he's seven months old and he's already started to eat solids so i think it's the right time to know you know what kind of solids that he's going to eat so we have the right balance in terms of carbs proteins and fat right from the beginning rather than know it later so in that sense it makes it easier for him to form a habit now so that it is it's in his lifestyle okay you
