creating my ENT the year doctor recently he said Ryan all the 20 to 40 year olds are going to be deaf in the future why because they're using these earphones in their years directly at high volume and they're also using the ones with Bluetooth radiation he says we don't have enough of research on how this is affecting people but he has told me people who have been using earphones whilst driving whilst working in call centers it has affected their earbuds so what can you do switch to wired headphones to avoid the Bluetooth radiation limit your use every day to 1 hour a day maybe use it in only one year and Alternate the years finally do what I do I've bought the wired earphones you can also listen to everything on a speaker so it's not directly blaring into your ear and it's not having the Bluetooth or EMF radiation right next to your year which is attached to your brains I think it's Common Sense people will troll me for the scientific data that is not out there but trust me there is common sense that says it is frying your brain
