[13.32 - 17.28] research a lot we look at the latest
[15.69 - 19.38] techniques we look at genetic testing
[17.28 - 21.39] blood testing and above all we look at
[19.38 - 23.46] scientific studies and then look at a
[21.39 - 26.94] high of 40 of us coming together and
[23.46 - 28.95] sharing our collective mind resources in
[26.94 - 30.96] terms of deciding whether we should give
[28.95 - 32.85] somebody a fish oil capsule we should
[30.96 - 35.28] give something cinema or you pick up of
[32.85 - 37.11] glutamine or why is beings going to be
[35.28 - 41.01] part of your you should connect with
[37.11 - 41.55] other medium so upfront navy beans black
[41.01 - 44.34] beans
[41.55 - 47.28] rajma china are going to be the guys
[44.34 - 49.20] that release rice and wheat in your diet
[47.28 - 50.70] the reason being is green is
[49.20 - 54.06] contributing too much of carbohydrate
[50.70 - 56.43] and the FTO gene which is based on
[54.06 - 58.50] carbohydrate sensitivity is actually see
[56.43 - 60.45] in a lot of Asian population that you
[58.50 - 63.69] don't need so much of grain in your diet
[60.45 - 66.15] you actually need more rajma China black
[63.69 - 68.34] beans or navy beans now researchers show
[66.15 - 71.46] people that is more about the leaves and
[68.34 - 72.38] I have a / a trauma and I've seen this
[71.46 - 74.66] in good client
[72.38 - 76.63] within recommended big meals for
[74.66 - 78.74] breakfast every morning or football
[76.63 - 80.57] ability I can't eat anything more
[78.74 - 83.00] because I'm so fully to the amount of
[80.57 - 85.19] protein the good carotid complex
[83.00 - 87.85] diverted that sustains you to the entire
[85.19 - 90.47] league yes I've heard reports works
[87.85 - 95.15] 2016-2017 but beans trust me is going to
[90.47 - 97.52] be the 2010 DB mantra so why is I may be
[95.15 - 99.47] shooting grain down a lot of us require
[97.52 - 101.36] some amount of great debt to drink
[99.47 - 103.16] because you need that because you need
[101.36 - 106.04] to stop ahead race so if you're in
[103.16 - 107.90] country I do like brown rice and I want
[106.04 - 110.87] you to go organic but most of the rules
[107.90 - 112.79] this year in 2080 try and attempt to buy
[110.87 - 114.98] organic because you're lessening the
[112.79 - 117.11] load in developing in terms the chemical
[114.98 - 121.37] processing so you live longer you're
[117.11 - 121.67] less cancer risk associated and brown
[121.37 - 123.50] rice
[121.67 - 125.48] well most of us more likely because
[123.50 - 128.90] Leslie pressure-cook you can do a brown
[125.48 - 131.36] basmati rice is what I say I calculated
[128.90 - 133.10] portions of akuto we are in ugly I
[131.36 - 134.24] normally have my brown rice and that's
[133.10 - 136.49] possible today
[134.24 - 138.48] but I need to keep our moving around in
[136.49 - 141.97] the office and towards the night
[138.48 - 143.98] Dean and my vegetables the other point
[141.97 - 147.37] that I wanted to focus on this year in
[143.98 - 151.48] 2080 will be cinnamon research showed
[147.37 - 153.61] that cinnamon okay are not four grams of
[151.48 - 157.09] cinnamon a day split up into small
[153.61 - 159.70] speakers moving your meals about your
[157.09 - 163.09] food salad hot cinnamon is able to
[159.70 - 166.57] reduce this little part and belly fat by
[163.09 - 169.03] up to four percent and cinnamon boosts
[166.57 - 171.46] incident sensitivity the number one
[169.03 - 174.97] criteria when people have triglycerides
[171.46 - 177.70] and cholesterol problem is because of an
[174.97 - 179.89] insulin resistance cinnamon is one
[177.70 - 183.31] component that is able to move you in
[179.89 - 186.94] the direction of better sugar management
[183.31 - 190.06] which in turn keeps you slimmer and
[186.94 - 192.07] healthier I not be true it because of
[190.06 - 194.11] anything and has long along with spinach
[192.07 - 196.00] because both beetroot and spinach have
[194.11 - 198.25] something on a slightly new path of
[196.00 - 198.85] dilation which means it dilates of blood
[198.25 - 201.58] vessels
[198.85 - 203.92] now beetroot above all because it's red
[201.58 - 205.54] in color and the pigment of red is going
[203.92 - 208.66] to have high anti-cancer properties
[205.54 - 211.72] especially keeping your clinic and I'd
[208.66 - 214.63] like to call as the municipality cleaner
[211.72 - 216.28] of your entire internal system now most
[214.63 - 219.88] people get beetroot the apple beet root
[216.28 - 222.40] juice is said to be don't like it I have
[219.88 - 225.55] discovered a new recipe and 2018 you
[222.40 - 227.38] should try this out be food alba make
[225.55 - 228.91] sure to block the organic taste would be
[227.38 - 230.92] fruit with more amount of raisins
[228.91 - 234.22] almonds and cashews and here
[230.92 - 235.99] ILD fact is not the problem sugar is the
[234.22 - 238.12] problem so when making this beautiful da
[235.99 - 240.73] try and make sure that you lessen the
[238.12 - 244.81] amount of sugar being used to prepare a
[240.73 - 246.40] little foie gras 92018 a new trend set
[244.81 - 247.51] up for me it's always been there my
[246.40 - 248.92] grandmother's - period
[247.51 - 250.81] your grandmother has done at your
[248.92 - 253.12] mother's done it my mother's done it
[250.81 - 254.92] offense so there we might have given to
[253.12 - 256.96] you the breakfast table I think our men
[254.92 - 259.42] should make a comeback because it's
[256.96 - 261.40] nutritiously back and I think the
[259.42 - 263.80] problem is everyone knows almonds are
[261.40 - 266.89] good we just have that habit anymore
[263.80 - 268.84] today's fast-paced lifestyle so in 2018
[266.89 - 270.19] what I'm saying to you is traditional
[268.84 - 272.38] knowledge that the other team and my
[270.19 - 275.23] team are had let's bring it back let's
[272.38 - 277.06] have 10 hours every morning sort the
[275.23 - 277.66] previous night for breakfast and when
[277.06 - 280.51] you feel it
[277.66 - 282.34] remember me right now finally in terms
[280.51 - 284.83] of my self defense I'm definitely gonna
[282.34 - 286.90] wanting you to have an omega-3 because
[284.83 - 289.45] it does vasodilation improves not
[286.90 - 290.11] function you lose the cholesterol
[289.45 - 294.64] profile
[290.11 - 296.86] boosts HDL cholesterol so if I am NOT
[294.64 - 298.87] eating fish three times a week then I
[296.86 - 300.97] want to get a special biopsy with me if
[298.87 - 302.29] you're a few of your vegetarian then you
[300.97 - 305.35] can try and look at boosting your
[302.29 - 307.47] omega-3 why of flax seeds a flaxseed oil
[305.35 - 310.03] supplements are also available
[307.47 - 312.40] additionally this year in your cabinet
[310.03 - 315.01] make sure you have more amount of zinc
[312.40 - 317.11] sulfate okay or zinc gluconate because
[315.01 - 318.43] you see most immune system is in our
[317.11 - 319.96] clinic at
[318.43 - 321.49] we have hundreds of people coming in and
[319.96 - 324.25] we do a lot of blood testing and
[321.49 - 326.38] additional mineral testing now what we
[324.25 - 328.48] are finding out is that people are
[326.38 - 330.64] lacking in certain minerals and zinc is
[328.48 - 333.16] one of them now Zeke is responsible for
[330.64 - 335.92] boosting your immune system if you
[333.16 - 337.78] notice 2017 they're both far more
[335.92 - 340.60] greater number of coughs and colds in
[337.78 - 343.27] your family check it out just recon this
[340.60 - 345.31] year 2018 keeper Daria who has had what
[343.27 - 347.80] cold when and how much it for how long
[345.31 - 349.93] because I am seeing people coming into
[347.80 - 351.73] updating with documenting assessment on
[349.93 - 353.20] an annual plan we seek there are a lot
[351.73 - 356.53] of people lost there are a lot of cool
[353.20 - 358.39] so we brought in sync to boost zinc in
[356.53 - 360.25] the blood and it also boosts
[358.39 - 361.99] testosterone Sookie are working on
[360.25 - 363.97] you also have been funding levels of
[361.99 - 365.95] testosterone in your Walker both men and
[363.97 - 368.29] women so Singh's gonna contribute to
[365.95 - 369.88] that you can take zinc continuously for
[368.29 - 372.25] a month or two and then take a break for
[369.88 - 374.32] a month or wetterstedt what I do is I
[372.25 - 376.12] take zinc on an alternate basis whenever
[374.32 - 378.37] a copper core is coming on I can feel
[376.12 - 380.17] the the the you know the mucous about
[378.37 - 381.91] the start or fielder could sneak in the
[380.17 - 384.37] throat then I stop taking that sake
[381.91 - 386.23] twice a day on that day to boost my
[384.37 - 387.88] system yes everyone says vitamin C but
[386.23 - 391.09] everyone knows about vitamin C I'm
[387.88 - 394.18] seeing brilliant zinc in 2018 and above
[391.09 - 397.03] all my favorite is glutamine powder
[394.18 - 400.21] glutamine is the most abundant amino
[397.03 - 402.19] acid in the skeletal muscle 60% of your
[400.21 - 404.11] skeletal muscle is made up of glutamine
[402.19 - 406.81] so you wanna have a scoop of glutamine
[404.11 - 408.70] in your orange juice wine a beverage or
[406.81 - 410.41] even in your green tea and when you're
[408.70 - 411.68] having this cocoa I mean it's also going
[410.41 - 414.05] to boost
[411.68 - 416.33] says the body Siddartha I'm gonna
[414.05 - 418.91] service the muscle and I wanna service
[416.33 - 421.79] the immune system so when you are
[418.91 - 424.22] clearly not more your muscles drop the
[421.79 - 425.57] glutamine resources as it is that all
[424.22 - 427.13] the element in the body will you eat it
[425.57 - 429.59] goes to the muscles and the immune
[427.13 - 431.63] system says oh my dear I don't have any
[429.59 - 435.05] new to me for me so maybe a
[431.63 - 437.18] supplementation can work I am allergic
[435.05 - 440.33] to build routine because of the milk and
[437.18 - 442.79] the lactose in it so what I try to do is
[440.33 - 445.13] I can't have a plant-based protein this
[442.79 - 447.20] year her discovered 2000 eating a pretty
[445.13 - 448.85] expensive new product no by the way
[447.20 - 450.29] there's no declaration I'm not running
[448.85 - 452.42] anything from this company I don't even
[450.29 - 454.19] know who the company owners are just not
[452.42 - 454.87] the product it's brilliant it's
[454.19 - 457.61] expensive
[454.87 - 460.97] amazing grass it's an organic proving
[457.61 - 463.61] power and it contains also the pea
[460.97 - 465.32] protein here routine quinoa reading and
[463.61 - 467.39] ham cooking now in India this is going
[465.32 - 469.55] to be bad because FSSA I said is that
[467.39 - 471.29] you cannot have improved in sold in
[469.55 - 473.03] India it's not on the list of food
[471.29 - 475.97] products so you most likely gonna have
[473.03 - 480.11] to even port de Skynet heaven packs the
[475.97 - 483.17] seal pound weight of protein as compared
[480.11 - 485.36] to even meat protein so it's one of
[483.17 - 487.43] those any lifters and dogs of the plant
[485.36 - 490.16] protein family and those were handsome
[487.43 - 492.11] other winding greens of it our diets are
[490.16 - 495.44] very acidic to this the more fruits
[492.11 - 498.14] be greater so the last body grass
[495.44 - 500.93] alfalfa's filled in after Elana broccoli
[498.14 - 502.82] and spinach now is this one that I have
[500.93 - 505.82] is a chocolate peanut butter flavor I
[502.82 - 507.86] really like it to have one not scoop
[505.82 - 509.60] which is 40 grams only about 20 grams of
[507.86 - 511.13] protein so those of you our fitness

[514.79 - 518.51] but there's only 50 percent protein in
[516.74 - 522.11] that I am working from a holistic
[518.51 - 523.82] perspective of lifestyle where I want
[522.11 - 526.31] the elements of anything else besides
[523.82 - 528.38] only protein to comment to my body keep
[526.31 - 531.71] in mind I'm also focused on dietary
[528.38 - 533.30] protein so what I'm recommending all of
