Title: Psyllium Husk - Explained by @DrPal   #beprohealth #podcast #nutritionguide #nutritionfacts

Description: Psyllium husk, derived from the seeds of the Plantago ovata plant, is a soluble fiber renowned for its health benefits. Often used as a dietary supplement, psyllium husk aids in digestion by absorbing water in the gut, forming a gel-like substance that promotes regular bowel movements. It is commonly used to relieve constipation, improve bowel regularity, and support overall digestive health. Additionally, psyllium husk may help lower cholesterol levels and regulate blood sugar levels. However, it's important to consume an adequate amount of water when taking psyllium husk to prevent potential digestive issues.
