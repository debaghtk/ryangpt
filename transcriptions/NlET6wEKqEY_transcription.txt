Transcript: they always say don't judge a book by its cover the perfect example of the adage is sitting next to me this evening Mr Ryan Fernando what is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the names Amir Khan vat kohi PV synu and suin Kumar to me they the physical perfection even though Ryan may look like someone who has just passed out of school he has over two decades of EXP experience and expertise in food biotechnology and Integrative Nutrition and this expertise has helped him help these Superstars achieve physical Perfection through Ryan so without further Ado let's hear it from the man himself so Ryan thank you so much how to eat like a celebrity this is that is a curious choice of topic for this talk could you elaborate on why this topic was chosen so you know I believe everyone's a celebrity in their own Liv the celebrities get paid to follow a diet obviously because let's say you take a verat kohi if his body is not F he can't perform or you take say Shahed kapor or Manoj Baja who I recently worked with their body has to look good on candr so I call this the vanity part of being a celebrity but post pandemic everyone's realizing that you can have you can change your house you can change your car you can change your clothes you can change just about everything but you can't change the human body you are born with this human body you will go in this human water and unlike your car which you can upgrade or change the model you can't change this so by bringing a certain Celebrity Status to your body I always tell people and if you leave today's session with no takeaway there's just one takeaway that I'm very grateful for all of you coming in here for today's session or picking up my book or listening to my videos which is you are the most expensive real estate you never own true you are the most expensive so when you put Dal chavel Roy when you put food into you when you put anything into you you are the Amir Khan verat kohi Anushka Sharma awara Ray of your own human body and that's why I keep using this term celebrity nutritionist it sounds nice I am not the celebrity but I do the nutrition for even arm admy and today even the arm admy is a celebrity so now Ryan coming to your book bestselling book let me remind you we bless a guide to a gluten-free life how does it help the Common Man or is it just for celebrities and sports persons so this was the second book that I wrote and um to be very truful to the audience there's no time to write a book nowadays cuz everyone everyone's consuming video content but fortunately by the grace of the Universe I wrote the book and I chose weakless as a topic because I I feel a lot of people treat Dal Shel Roy as given to them out of love and kaisha S of for example who is taught you how to eat your mother your mother your mother's taught how does your mother teach you love and culture how did my mother teach me love and culture how did your mother teach you love and culture is there any science behind the W food culturally you know so my logic as a nutritionist now is you know when you send your car for serviceing the guy says sir are servicing now we take one us we connect a computer to a car and you come to another full Diagnostics but Dal R is still doing ancient way so writing the book was me having a decade of experience at the clinic where I practice and so in this audience I can actually take a bed if you spend 2 minutes with me just on five questions I'll ask you my probability of telling you your gluten okay that is you can take it or gluten you can't take it is there the problem is when I tell you Glen come diagnosis but when you test it or you do a Diagnostics and you get the result I have to follow so weakless was kind of a blueprint to tell story and make people kind of go in that direction in hindsight I should have written a book which was about an office diet plan or a corporate diet plan when everyone goes to work how you plan a better then but I always listen to The Voice in the back of my head there's a voice that everyone has I'm sure all of you you know you get that ingry voice about where you should go who should meet or what should you do should I do it always listen to that voice inside of you a voice told me write a book on weat list it might help you people out there so I'm hoping if somebody needs it and even if one person changes their life I've done my job there is still time to write that other book that you're like thinking of you mentioned that the traditional way of eating I mean you've learned from your families your cultures so were they wrong in any way in U providing you the diet or the diet that each dge of follows we can never see our ancestors are wrong and what if I was Microsoft Windows version sery and today we have Windows 11 and the guy who R seven he was not wrong he took us to a certain place in society so our ancestors have brought us to a certain level and I just had this discussion with another fellow speaker which is society has advanced so much that maybe the crops that are grown on the soil is not having enough of minerals in the soil or maybe that the insecticides and pesticides are so high is different what my great-grandfather ate M that my grandfather ate no avocados and I can eat an avocado every day so my allergy reaction to no seasonality of food is affecting my body so therefore the way my ancestors eight was correct in their time and their day but we need to take bits and pieces of that fine unit so when we work in my clinic we actually don't go through a half an hour recall of what you do you can ask you what is your culture what is your background what do you normally eat and then when you give a nutrition plan to people they like but this is very close to what is already given but then we TW tweak it a little bit with science you ran one of your most quoted quotes is that muscle is the only reversible organ in the body what do you mean by that and how does it help with advancing AE I tell like I said at the beginning of the the whole session your mod is the most expensive real estate you'll ever own now whenever you buy a real estate you want it to appreciate in value unfortunately the human body which is actually your most expensive real estate is actually depreciating because of age but there was this research paper that was done so very interestingly let's say that this side of the never the research was done on two groups so that outside of or the 72y old in an old age home and they gave them Bingo Ludo Judo and all of those games the other side the 72 year olds got a gym in the basement and for 6 months one group play and one group Grumble Bingo 72 years retired and know what do you want us to do here and this group grumbled about going to the gym and working out 6 months later they came back and did a biopsy for those of you who are not in medical biopsy means you take out a piece of your muscle all tissue so you biopsy of the quadricep muscle and they found out in the group that was Ludo Bingo Judo housi and all their muscle age Ed by 6 years the group that had the gene or did the resistance training the muscle regress ringr meaning went back in time by six years so that study gave encouragement to scien is that if people take up resistance training or strength training at any point in their life irrespective of their age they can make the muscle grow younger so I I highly encouraged I am highly encouraged especially the women in the audience especially the women in the audience yes you running yes new your Zumba class yes new your dance class yes Yoda yes Pates but take up weight training because when you're 70 years of age and this is the 35th literature festival and you make me again you'll be like ly and check out my muscles and I'm still able to climb these stairs up so that's most important muscle anyone who is at any age who can afford testing we look at lipid profiles foros level lipin a lipin b sing reactive protein ESR now these levels are high and I've seen this athletes young athletes they're very high I tell the parents your kid is one designing what hyperactivity number one number two when people wear exercise variables and contract your heart haate most people go to the jail first of all they training and I am Superman and J's Bo so they push the body they may have an underlying isure so when you put when you start compounding these things it becomes a very H recipe and obviously if you look at the vaccination Posta Spike protein the spike protein which is produced by the technology in the vaccine to protect us against Co which is a good thing has the spike Prov attenuated Spike protein so that where the locations of action heart ovaries and women so when people agressively work out chances of light lot are also higher so now if you put many Cascades you look at the whole probability of let's say that one unfortunate or unlucky Soul had all of these permutations and combinations I for passim on and then they come to the protein Park which I genuinely Caron the industry is promoting too much of protein today so you have too many of the supplement manufacturers saying you need to take a protein supplement like I go in the gym that I don't take a protein supplement cuz I work for supplement companies before I started my own nutrition gaming and I got threee protein supplements and no matter how much of protein supplement I took I did not become Manus was Neer so the thought process over here is the Showmanship so today in the gyming industry the youngsters are are going after what we call a show Muscle instead I ask them to go after go muscle so you need to have go muscle rather than Show Muscle so in the art of chasing show Muscle they now dunk more protein minus carbs minus fiber causes gut problems causes various issues which maybe the body shouldn't be getting 200 g of protein a day so when you put all of these things together I think it's it's end Gym trainer giving advice to an influential person and and I've seen this even recently in my gym there was a highly qualified medical person who was taking advice from the Gym trainer and IA the person as old and I said listen you are so highly educated but just because Danka is a great body listening to the advice so sometimes he the way people look today and all this capture people are easily swayed to start changing their diet to these exotic diets they try to fire follow those diets and get this show body and somewhere along the line if they've not found this underlining condition then it's a recipe for disaster for them and how do you go about deciding on what foods are beneficial for someone and what not I mean are there some tests you perform some parameters you judge how does the whole thing work when someone approaches you for the first time so you see um as I said earlier I was working with supplement companies and we were selling these multivitamins hble drug and protein MERS and all and then every time we told somebody to take a PR they said by now if you understand the world of nutrition there are Specialists called dietition or nutritionist the difference is a dietician can work in a hospital or nutritionist Works in general lifestyle conditions when such individual prescribe a diet what do the go with in the fast it was Sir what do you like to eat or you like to eatly a k toly so they need portion control and I in a two netive practice we started off at a wing scale so we looked at your BMI then broughten down lower then you got this Advanced wi scale this Advanced wi scale has F percentage and visle F so was able to shock people visal fat is Shifting and your body age sir what is your clinical age oh my my birth centy age is 40 but were Vis Fant age is showing now you're 65 so we would sh people and then get them to follow the diet then we went into blood testing then we went into genetic testing so the genetic testing Where You observe the foods is called nutrigenomics so for example I have a caffeine sensitivity Gene my dad's a South indiia he loves coffee I love coffee but when I did the genetic test it was like you are a slow responder to caffeine and if I drink more than four to five cups of coffee because I'm a slow responder to caffeine my risk of heart attack is higher however sort of if let's say you have a fast processing caffeine Gene you should drink six cups of coffee a day so nutrition is becoming diagnostically treatable from what you should be taking and at the same time the latest now is the microbiome which is the poop analys of the stool analysis and the huge data coming out of that so much so that rheumatoid arthritis in one of the latest articles that I'm been reading is not being caused by a nonv it's being caused by a bacteria in your gut that has the ability to pump up the rheumatoid factor in your body and Par in the last 2 years you may have seen a lot of companies for those of you who are diabetic the cgn devices come out continuous glucose monitor we've always had that pin prick and keep testing our glucose levels been around for about 15 20 years now but the singam one is giving people real time data oh I had Biryani in nakur for lunch and my sugar went up to 210 so suddenly what happens is there's an awareness coming out so as a nutritionist when I take all of these factors and marriage into technology which is a software I now get a nutrition plan which is bioindividual and very accurate unforunately to do this seismic activity is quite expensive and time consuming but the good news is the costs are dropping every year and with the Advent of artificial intelligence I Believe by 2030 Ryan Fernando will retire and there will be an alar of ran fando telling you you should be eating this and you should be doing that and and I predict that that P that comes on it it'll be like so then Biryani is too heavy for you mute mute mute I'm not listening to you today so that's going to be the future yes the wonders of Technology Ryan wheat and maida form the cracks of the Indian diet here in this book of yours you talk of avoiding these I'm certain most of us here would like to know why and how followed by what alterations we need to make in our diets to supplement the benefits of wheat and gluten so you know like anybody in the room I'm first human then I became a nutritionist and then I got confused okay why did I confused because people say is this food good or is this food not good I I believe you should approach food like a judge you see if you go into a Court rule you have a defense attorney and you have a prosecuting attorney so imagine there was father sitting in front of us you're the defense attorney I'm the prosecution there should be the audience here is the judge now if you suddenly say that maida is not good you are becoming a if you say no no no MAA is very good you be the defender everybody should behave with the food in their body as a judge have an independent Cod of does this food agree with me or does not agree with me so when I looked at all the foods on the planet a lot of the inflammatory conditions were coming also in Daily and weit now I didn't write a book on milk because I probably would have got a assassination letter or a Hitman letter saying that the milk power lob is too powerful in the country please don't assassinate milk but jokes are far weeds traditionally C company meat was only this tall about 6 in I believe through genetic modification with grasses that have Bren uh gluten the two diin and gluten have somehow changed the complexity of the way this molecule of gluten exists in let's say me MAA which gives beautiful properties of uh softness tension all of that stuff and so one maybe somewhere in an evolutionary point of view the Indian subcontinent did not grow that much of wheat if you go back into history we more of milet and rice and less of wheat no because somehow there was an Green Revolution this came in and then as a nutritionist I'm reading a lot of this require more glyco phosphates and get rid of the weeds and then that's coming into our system insecticides pesticides Etc all of those things so I am not saying that in wheat or maida or dry orani which contain are for I wrote this book cuz I had adult acne all my life till 36 years of age till I went and did the genetic testing and found out that I asum Goan 50% Goan dad's a Taman I'm not supposed to eat bread but I was dra born and brought up on eating bread at breakfast lunch and dinner so when you go home to your mom and your mom says k cut you're not a big sh your I fed you this food all your life you just eat the bread I don't I don't eat at home at all I don't go home at all if I go home I'm like Mom Mom it's no time my mom doesn't go and this time when I went home to go I didn't dat a single minute she she will me the bread how do you convince culturally your mother your family your friends your society that this food doesn't agree with me but that person not sitting and holding your hand next to the toilet [Laughter] no so the whole idea of the writing the book was to let people know that hey there's something in this story over here let me check it out and I believe for every 10 Indians maybe three are sensitive to gluten maybe seven are not so as I said earlier I wrote the wrong book but if I can help three people figure that out and not get adult acne and have to suffer through it their whole life there's something allergic ritis children with deficient immune system if your kids get frequent cavities just do the gluten DNA test if you find out that K allergic to gluten suddenly the cavi stop so I written about this in the book and these are small Snippets that have been taken from just observation so people say where is the scientific proof and I just have this one thought which is my scientific proof is not 10,000 people in a in a specialized trial it's you sitting in front of me telling me all your symptoms I I give the best possible diet and I keep observing you for 6 months to one year and if I see improvements I keep that in my head and then as you keep working with people you suddenly begin to form patterns or Trends and that's where you know you sit as a judge and you figure out should I convict gluten as you know guity or not guen going further what is food intolerance and how does a lay man go about discovering and avoiding it you see you don't eat out of seasonality anymore you don't know if you can go back to your grandmothers or great grandmother's time they got certain fruits like for example I asked for orange juice today in the hotel and I got orange juice I'm in the city of oranges right but there's a season so I was told it's not the season but you still have on orang is available which means I can still consume it so forood in tolerance arises when I believe that you give too much of the same food every day and you got up sometimes say I'm fed up of this and the security systems in your intestinal barrier begin to break down and you get an absorption of certain foods that able to cross into your bloodstream and suddenly start slapping you so when it start start slapping you which is what I call as a juga antigen antibody reaction we tend to get these alarming signals from the body no lock no sinus you know Mal absorption of vitamins and minerals so when you look at all of these things eating almonds every morning every day for five years may not be the right thing because does an Armen tree grow on NP no why would you eat arm for 360 no my grandmother said five AR are very good for the bread so I'm not Prosecuting alond I'm saying the way you been meting is too much on the same phone too long too often get in seasonality so yeah intolerance to the for in I'll give you a simple example when I did my blood test for food and Dons eggs came on the list I love eating eggs I had eggs this morning but I will not do it more than one a week so Monday till next Saturday I will not touch egg because if I I get a pimple or two but like but Ryan how do you know you got a pimple because of eggs because the blood test stole me and then I purposely ate eggs for seven days and I like oh I got pimples and then I didn't Dr the eggs for green no pimple then again I ate EG oh I got a pimple so food intolerance is something that everyone can discover on their own by simple things like fasting you fast we have forgotten the art of fasting our ancestors did fasting in every religion in Christianity we did fasting in Hinduism you did fasting in Islam you did fasting why don't we fast anymore it's because life has become so fast and L why is because our ancestors our ancestors knew that fasting was something to reset your gut to remove the bombardment of food so I think that's one way you can avoid the food to it's by fasting in my book is actually from a perspective it was picking up one topic as I say I didn't feel there was a resource out there to help people understand it really well in fact a daughter came to me and said sir I gave your book to my mother and then she understood that why she needs to remove it from my diet I'm a huge believer in mixing up the diet okay but at the same time when somebody says I do the nine Green Mix or four Health Green Mix or I do joar and vaja or I do this mixer and not let me say one thing no grain has got the accurate nutritional value in it meaning Jo are grown out this part of the world and Jo are grown in let's say utar Pradesh there will be nutritional a variances in that so whenever you do mix of any green the first thing you look for in a kid is how was your party was a part good was your party bad right so you come to looking at clinical symptoms if you want to go into deep diet feed your kids that for 6 months look at the weight of the king look at the height of the king and if possible do a genetic test if possible do a blood test and you can't do any of this just look like a ancestor the kid is feeling good K not farting up the hours it's absolutely fine for me to pick one super food or one super combination I don't think any nutrition should be doing that the nutrition should be going in the philosophy is very very important and the mummies are the people who buy the food that's the most important thing toing with zato swingy and also will due respect to all the women in the room while you hold a ker and manage the kitchen which may not be true about our elders our elders and the moms handle the kitchen this transition has got into the convenience of the kitchen convenience of the kitchen you rely on Brands to tell you what is good right so I'm sure many of you are watching that somebody some brand will claim ke 4tify joar flower with healthy XY Z and look at it it's only 1% so I think it's the responsibility of mothers to look at the nutritional ingredient and then look at I don't know n the blood group the blood test your culture what your kid is into what is your kids profile all of that stuff I think whenever you decide to put a food into your body it's like maam what phone do you have what phone do you use OnePlus I have a OnePlus he has an iPhone what phone do you use I iph everyone has different phones me one so food is like that he would say no no no we have to just figure out like for example if I want to be a villain soy bean is very bad why you giving soy bean so now I'm taking prosecution approach I'm not saying who is the person getting exposed to soybean maybe it is actually good soine is very good for men above the age of 45 because it drops bad cholesterol because of ganin and deadin in it so I like to say one food is thumbs up or one food is thumbs down I am judge sitting in a room saying that boss let me see the patient let me see the client and then we decide first of all I mean the pre YouTube was our grandmother so from generation to generation that n got handed down now today people who don't go into kitchens are also Experts of nutrition so my thought process is entertainment like sometime I get very angry recently on LinkedIn there's this elderly gentleman I won't take the name but he was a finance banker and he's getting 6,000 likes 6,000 6,000 shares I'm looking at it and I'm like okay so I think again as I said to her the reason I have become very successful is I refuse to take a sign in general consensus I I refuse to create a video that will say that you have to look at the person and buyo individually give advice for that one person so I think that's the approach and for all the dietitians or nutritionist in the room artificial intelligence is going to take away our jobs from a perspective of telling you what's right or wrong in the bio individuality marrying all the test and bio so diet plan Automatic by technology you want to be in this profession become a great health counselor analyze because the human race I'm telling you will not follow the watch or the phone for a diet plan it needs motivation because the biggest Tempest on the planet is your taste buds I'll tell you eat this food T so the most important thing is watch your taste parts listen to YouTube with a pinch of salt the human race has genes in It software code is there in the human body so you have something known as Mt HFR Gene let's call it anti mtfr this ATI Gene may be on or off in people if the Auntie is on it is able to take vitamin B9 and convert vitamin B9 into security gar goes inside your bloodstream and starts slapping cholesterol cherol so cholesterol gets very scared and goes to the side and forms flock so to control you need more me fatey Dy mtfr gen down then your processing of methy folate is very low home assist says and then the H goes up slaps cholesterol and creates a high formation of the book so it's a very good qu I had a running coach coming to me ah run run run running coach huh runs half a dozen marathons in the year gets Vlogs his MTF mommy daddy so you got that so thetion the assumption that physical activity confers a blanket protection on you is suspect which is why I tell people you can't outrun a bad diet you can't out bad genetics but you can change it don't drink coffee because because coffee contains caol which raises your homos levels get a blood test for vitamin B9 and b12 or B complex because if these are low you could take vegetarian supplement from a food perspective pumpkins mustach all foods contain B9 V12 but when you take folic acid B9 and your anti mtfr is not working thing it will not absorb folic acid so you need to take a supplement called methy folet I would suggest get a blood test done one last question from my for B to everyone here right how does a person say from nagpur get in touch with you and how do you take that case forward so obviously IND know Google is we why Google running in Fernando and the website comes the Instagram GES and all that GES I practice and work with a clinic called Quan nutrition Quan Latin means incapacity of so I work with 75 other dietitians on my team and if you follow my YouTube videos or my Instagram videos hopefully I'm one of those YouTubers that can convince you cuz I've convinced amen Khan and shikan and robinan how to get better and hopefully K is going to have the highest number of centuy that nobody ever is going to beat you all right so thank you everyone and thank you for coming today one that's [Applause] it [Applause]
