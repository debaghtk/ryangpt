[0.06 - 4.86] so Kenny why do you think nutrition is
[2.64 - 6.84] important I think it's very important
[4.86 - 9.12] because as an athlete and as just you
[6.84 - 10.74] know for daily use uh
[9.12 - 13.50] um you know it's very important for your
[10.74 - 14.34] body to be at the utmost like be at its
[13.50 - 15.84] peak
[14.34 - 17.10] um for a Sprint team for me it's very
[15.84 - 18.90] important because I need to make sure
[17.10 - 20.82] that I'm recovering right and making
[18.90 - 22.80] sure that I'm having all the energy to
[20.82 - 24.36] be able to Sprint the uh the first 100
[22.80 - 26.34] meters and then the last 100 meters and
[24.36 - 28.38] the 200 meters so
[26.34 - 29.88] um if you had to choose any foods that
[28.38 - 31.32] really give you energy what would be
[29.88 - 34.44] your best
[31.32 - 35.76] um the good stuff good stuff and the bad
[34.44 - 37.80] stuff
[35.76 - 39.90] well we just ordered pizza so I say
[37.80 - 42.24] pizza as the bad stuff and the good
[39.90 - 46.80] stuff I like uh I like steak medium rare
[42.24 - 49.80] and sweet potato with broccoli
[46.80 - 51.30] awesome and um what is your advice to
[49.80 - 53.46] Young athletes
[51.30 - 55.98] um while watching you if you had to go
[53.46 - 59.10] back in a time capsule and meet can you
[55.98 - 60.96] use 14 years of age nutrition point of
[59.10 - 63.00] view what would you tell that kid
[60.96 - 64.50] I would tell them to do their best with
[63.00 - 66.54] their nutrition because I mean when I
[64.50 - 68.64] was in high school in college I ate like
[66.54 - 71.04] trash uh eating hot Cheetos having
[68.64 - 72.48] Skittles before races and I mean if you
[71.04 - 74.22] have a dream to become an elite athlete
[72.48 - 76.14] I think it's better to start out
[74.22 - 78.36] um you know sooner than later especially
[76.14 - 79.86] at a young age and it's also just
[78.36 - 81.84] healthier for the body you know finding
[79.86 - 83.70] out that I had uh the whole gluten
[81.84 - 85.02] problems and all that um I didn't find
[83.70 - 86.58] that until later but you know it's
[85.02 - 88.26] continuously damaging the body when
[86.58 - 90.48] you're putting all those toxins in so
[88.26 - 92.40] you know that's the advice just uh if
[90.48 - 95.34] you have a dream to become an athlete uh
[92.40 - 97.20] Elite athlete at the highest stage start
[95.34 - 99.26] early and it'll make everything easier
[97.20 - 101.76] later on awesome
[99.26 - 103.98] because I'm writing a book on gluten at
[101.76 - 106.98] the end of this year on how you should
[103.98 - 110.16] do the testing and come to know about it
[106.98 - 113.36] I mean gluten sound and pastries and
[110.16 - 116.70] bread and pizza all my favorite things
[113.36 - 119.04] yeah but now that you found out that
[116.70 - 122.16] you're Gluten Sensitive and you're
[119.04 - 124.02] eliminating it from your diet did you
[122.16 - 125.94] actually see a difference in your
[124.02 - 127.92] training in the weight room in your
[125.94 - 129.60] performance and yeah you did see a
[127.92 - 130.92] difference which is making you kind of
[129.60 - 131.76] give up these things that you really
[130.92 - 134.16] like
[131.76 - 136.14] what's the thought process in that
[134.16 - 137.64] former not from a like oh my body's
[136.14 - 139.62] feeling better but just from the battle
[137.64 - 141.48] that goes on in your head when you you
[139.62 - 144.00] know to have or not to have
[141.48 - 145.50] uh I mean initially it was really hard I
[144.00 - 147.66] mean I got the test done found out my
[145.50 - 149.28] gluten levels were through the roof and
[147.66 - 150.66] went back home I had to look through
[149.28 - 153.66] everything and it's kind of like wow I
[150.66 - 155.22] can't eat this uh uh mentally it's so
[153.66 - 157.56] you're more aware of it now when you go
[155.22 - 158.88] to places yeah I checked for everywhere
[157.56 - 161.10] I go I check to make sure if it has
[158.88 - 162.36] gluten-free or not um I have cheat days
[161.10 - 164.40] sometimes but that's when I really
[162.36 - 166.20] deserve it and that's usually in the off
[164.40 - 168.18] season but I mean it's a battle every
[166.20 - 169.86] day I always you know go to the store
[168.18 - 171.48] I'm like I want this because I know it's
[169.86 - 173.46] going to taste better
[171.48 - 176.16] um but you know I gotta make sure to not
[173.46 - 177.96] take it because I do feel better and it
[176.16 - 181.02] helps me perform better at a better
[177.96 - 183.78] level and all that but um
[181.02 - 186.24] yeah just it's what's really hard about
[183.78 - 188.76] it is just the taste and
[186.24 - 190.80] finally it's tough but it's also like
[188.76 - 193.74] the gluten-free stuff it's healthier
[190.80 - 195.66] obviously but it's hard to find a a
[193.74 - 198.18] brand or uh somebody that actually makes
[195.66 - 200.96] it tasty like when you travel and all
[198.18 - 200.96] for the world championship
[201.90 - 204.44] are you like
[205.62 - 209.88] not on a nutrition plan yeah I have to
[208.08 - 211.74] be more prepared I gotta make usually
[209.88 - 213.36] when I go to competition overseas I
[211.74 - 214.98] don't usually eat the food that's down
[213.36 - 217.32] you know at the hotel because first of
[214.98 - 219.00] all it doesn't taste that good and then
[217.32 - 220.86] um it's not what I what I need you know
[219.00 - 223.80] we are we have a plan to make sure that
[220.86 - 227.28] I I'm you know the race is you know I
[223.80 - 229.32] get the job done at the race and um
[227.28 - 231.12] what I usually do is just order from out
[229.32 - 232.86] and I just make sure just to get what I
[231.12 - 234.72] need and make sure that it's gluten free
[232.86 - 237.00] so that's how I kind of manage that
[234.72 - 238.44] aspect when I go overseas but in the US
[237.00 - 240.42] it's a lot easier because I can kind of
[238.44 - 242.16] bring my own stuff and I'm familiar with
[240.42 - 243.66] the companies and all that but overseas
[242.16 - 245.04] is a little tougher but I still get it
[243.66 - 247.98] done
[245.04 - 250.16] weight room or track which is your
[247.98 - 250.16] favorite
[250.38 - 253.68] depends on the training yeah it depends
[252.24 - 254.76] on the training if the if the track is
[253.68 - 256.02] really hard I don't want to go to the
[254.76 - 258.54] weight room but then there's if it's
[256.02 - 260.22] easy I love going to the weight room
[258.54 - 262.08] it supplement that you have when you
[260.22 - 265.26] work out then you can feel the
[262.08 - 267.90] difference is it a hydration drink is it
[265.26 - 269.76] a RCA is it a protein powder what do you
[267.90 - 270.96] feel what what do you look forward to
[269.76 - 273.24] taking
[270.96 - 274.22] well it's not the beat the beat uh what
[273.24 - 278.82] is the beat
[274.22 - 282.00] yeah I take them but I I
[278.82 - 284.00] you what's the
[282.00 - 286.44] I forgot what it's called but it's some
[284.00 - 289.92] hydration drink that I put in the water
[286.44 - 291.72] in it okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so
[289.92 - 293.28] you like that yeah because it has a
[291.72 - 295.88] glitch is my thirst and it has a little
[293.28 - 299.04] uh good taste to it so
[295.88 - 301.20] what's your advice to uh people on
[299.04 - 304.20] working with professionals from the
[301.20 - 306.36] coach to the physio to the master to the
[304.20 - 308.76] nutritionists to the Mind core you know
[306.36 - 311.28] you're you're up there with some of the
[308.76 - 313.62] best in the world you want a silver uh
[311.28 - 315.66] at the Tokyo Olympics
[313.62 - 316.86] what is your perspective of working with
[315.66 - 318.66] the team
[316.86 - 320.28] uh it's good for basic communication
[318.66 - 321.84] with everybody the coach knows what's
[320.28 - 324.30] going on with the mental health and the
[321.84 - 326.58] nutrition so we can all communicate to
[324.30 - 329.10] each other and how much of a how much of
[326.58 - 331.32] like you know a load is it on you or how
[329.10 - 333.44] much of a relief is it on you what goes
[331.32 - 335.46] through your mind when you're like okay
[333.44 - 337.98] weight training I want to follow my
[335.46 - 340.08] Fitness training or follow the code is
[337.98 - 341.88] does it get heavy because for athletes
[340.08 - 344.10] out there everyone assumes being a
[341.88 - 346.38] champion is quite easy now every
[344.10 - 348.66] Champion has an entire supportive so
[346.38 - 350.52] what's it like what what goes on in your
[348.66 - 352.44] head because I know I keep telling you
[350.52 - 354.80] you gotta eat this and you're like I
[352.44 - 357.54] wish I could just die in a pizza yeah
[354.80 - 359.40] it's it's hard more mentally taxing um
[357.54 - 361.56] so it's momentum yeah more mental
[359.40 - 363.60] because you know I I have all these you
[361.56 - 365.22] know duties I got to do the these uh
[363.60 - 367.20] check marks I gotta bring on it and it's
[365.22 - 368.46] a lot of work but I mean it's worth it
[367.20 - 370.68] because at the end of the day when I end
[368.46 - 372.60] up getting the gold or silver you know I
[370.68 - 374.70] did what I needed to do to get to that
[372.60 - 376.14] point and it's a good feeling to to know
[374.70 - 378.12] that I actually did everything to get up
[376.14 - 379.62] to that point and you I come in more
[378.12 - 380.88] confident too when I know that I'm doing
[379.62 - 382.62] everything you know if I don't have my
[380.88 - 383.94] beaded or if I don't have this and that
[382.62 - 385.74] right before the race I'm gonna be kind
[383.94 - 387.12] of like okay you know I didn't do that
[385.74 - 388.56] so what's going to happen but if I do
[387.12 - 390.78] everything I'm like okay I'm confident I
[388.56 - 392.70] got everything done and let's go this
[390.78 - 395.94] can he cook
[392.70 - 398.34] barely uh if you had to make something
[395.94 - 400.86] for yourself what would you cook I can
[398.34 - 403.20] make salmon some uh some honey some
[400.86 - 404.76] honey drizzled salmon I just started
[403.20 - 406.38] cooking that and I can make a burger but
[404.76 - 407.82] I'm learning right now
[406.38 - 410.16] um I mean so far I've been ordering out
[407.82 - 412.14] all the time but so when you want it out
[410.16 - 414.00] are you kind of going to the menu like
[412.14 - 415.62] looking up where what's available and
[414.00 - 419.42] stuff like that yeah I look to see what
[415.62 - 419.42] it is and uh earlier would you do that
[423.47 - 426.55] [Music]
[427.04 - 430.92] yeah because I was tired I'd be like oh
[429.30 - 432.54] this is tasty okay listen I didn't think
[430.92 - 434.64] about any of the negative effects this
[432.54 - 437.04] has been replaced now with more planning
[434.64 - 439.14] on okay I gotta get my carbs yeah is
[437.04 - 440.46] there some protein in this yes yeah I
[439.14 - 441.72] gotta get some but I also try to still
[440.46 - 443.94] make sure it tastes a little good so I
[441.72 - 445.38] can enjoy you know
[443.94 - 448.50] cool
[445.38 - 450.54] any last advice to track and field
[448.50 - 453.36] athletes across the world
[450.54 - 454.74] uh just listen to your coaches and you
[453.36 - 456.30] gotta and then make sure to find a good
[454.74 - 458.04] team because if I didn't have a good
[456.30 - 460.56] team I want to be at the position I am
[458.04 - 462.48] right now uh be very difficult for me to
[460.56 - 464.76] even figure out what to do to make sure
[462.48 - 467.04] that I am you know running at the
[464.76 - 470.22] highest level but having a good support
[467.04 - 472.62] system you know nutritionist coach you
[470.22 - 473.94] know mental health coaching you know
[472.62 - 476.34] lifestyle coach you know everybody
[473.94 - 477.66] family it's all very important because
[476.34 - 479.76] you know it's going to make everything
[477.66 - 481.44] easier for you when you you know hear
[479.76 - 483.78] The Gunshot off and then at the end of
[481.44 - 487.32] the race if you were not a track and
[483.78 - 490.92] field athlete what would you be
[487.32 - 493.56] I love sports everything Sports uh so if
[490.92 - 495.24] I wasn't in track I would be I in
[493.56 - 496.80] football because I love football I think
[495.24 - 498.90] I love football more than track but
[496.80 - 500.82] track is safer so there's an
[498.90 - 503.04] intellectual part of Kenny
[500.82 - 505.32] if you were not into sport what other
[503.04 - 507.12] profession would you have chosen in
[505.32 - 510.06] another lifetime I was thinking of
[507.12 - 511.68] taking up uh Sports Medicine
[510.06 - 514.20] maybe be an athletic trainer or
[511.68 - 515.64] something like that so I I took a class
[514.20 - 517.44] in high school and then I was planning
[515.64 - 518.76] on taking one in college but they didn't
[517.44 - 520.02] have the class so I was going to do it
[518.76 - 521.52] later but
[520.02 - 523.76] um you know now I'm doing this so I got
[521.52 - 526.80] to figure out what I want to do now yeah
[523.76 - 528.84] maybe that or do some business or
[526.80 - 529.92] something like that but awesome really
[528.84 - 532.16] Kenny
[529.92 - 532.16] foreign
