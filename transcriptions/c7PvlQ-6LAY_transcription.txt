Transcript: I have a question yeah so where do we get high acidity and taking supplement for long time very well very good question so first question is acidity acidity everyone knows acidosis and athletes it's not because it builds up to such a level and click so normally pure that is one one aspect second this because of long intervals of training athletes don't eat enough second is lot of the athletes eat outside coaches it outside trainers it outside can can can disturb your gastric mucosa okay acidity can be genetic it can be genetic now do supplements cause acidity yes I believe that to a certain extent when you look at a food allergy test okay when you look at food allergy test if you're taking foods like gluten lactose and they're not agreeing with you the gut and the intestine are releasing unnecessary amount of enzymes to digest that food which I don't like so in terms of healing we can acidity can be treated from the range of things but from a nutritional point of view our basic premise is the alkaline diet the alkaline diet is coming from the prospect of finding more alkaline foods and you could use soda bike up in your sports drinks to reduce the acidity to reduce acid also so from that direction we can use supplements to reduce acidity things like I have had athletes with omega-3 when they take an accessory in acidic so even what was the other one there's one more that very frequently causes at 75 it's fabulous lot of carpet sometimes Lewis acid a caffeine aspirin for the longest period of time aspirin has been used as the ECA stack if you remember the effort in caffeine and aspirin will be out for the c√©vennes athletes take this they tend to have greater moderate is trying can you take medicines for acidity and does it help so so what is the medicine do so I always say no if you get cut like you have to find out how you got cut so how you have to discover why you're getting a setting is it improper diet timing is it improper food in the diet is it overload or supplement is it genetic now the short short term fix will be medication okay because medication your proton pump inhibitors and all of that stuff will reduce your as I said production and medical yes if a person is in pain the correct prognosis is to go to a doctor and get a prescription to take care of that side by side work of the country does probiotic help in acidity throw by this hundred percent specifically lactobacillus acidophilus and before the doctor really has been a acidity what has worked in my clinical practice has been glutamine glutamine early morning on an empty stomach helps in healing the intestinal mucosa so I know what five grams of glutamine early morning also when you have protein and 5 gram teaspoon every two three hours it forms a bolus so the acid attacks the the the protein forms of bolus which is a common problem like it's well suffering stomach and protects the lining of the stomach from getting attacked so you can actually use food to kind of cheat and prevent a society so apple churning of vinegar so take it in empty stomach does it help I've had both cases I had both cases so I'm Oprah doctor to see fit you should Google up this kind of this - Dominic he's the world renowned professor on alkaline cure so he recommends apple cider vinegar or any morning but when I have recommended apple cider vinegar to certain equal it actually increases so it's the the acid-base balance varies for positive food so again that's why people like me are in business because they never one right answer okay so you have to do the trial and error
