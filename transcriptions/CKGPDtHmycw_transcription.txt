[0.08 - 4.72] according to a 2023 Economic Times
[2.48 - 7.28] article India experiences around 1 lakh
[4.72 - 11.28] 185,000 Strokes each year which is
[7.28 - 14.36] roughly one stroke every 40 seconds and
[11.28 - 17.20] one Indian died every 4 minutes because
[14.36 - 20.68] of stroke high blood pressure is a major
[17.20 - 24.00] risk factor for strokes in India 75% of
[20.68 - 26.60] stroke cases are directly linked to high
[24.00 - 29.44] blood pressure or high BP blood clots
[26.60 - 32.80] can travel from the brain and block
[29.44 - 35.28] blood flow leading to a conditions like
[32.80 - 37.52] atrial fibrillation can increase the
[35.28 - 39.96] risk of a blood clot formation did you
[37.52 - 42.28] know that 20% of The Strokes in India
[39.96 - 44.56] are actually caused by blood clots now
[42.28 - 47.68] how are these connected imagine your
[44.56 - 50.40] blood vessels as highways high blood
[47.68 - 52.76] pressure is like driving too fast on
[50.40 - 55.44] these highways the pressure can damage
[52.76 - 57.84] the walls of your blood vessels making
[55.44 - 60.84] them more likely to develop rough
[57.84 - 63.88] patches or potholes and these rough
[60.84 - 66.80] patches can catch blood cells and
[63.88 - 69.12] actually form clots a blood clot is like
[66.80 - 71.52] a traffic jam on your blood vessel
[69.12 - 74.36] Highway if this clot is big enough it
[71.52 - 77.16] can block the blood flow to your brain
[74.36 - 79.48] this blockage is actually what causes a
[77.16 - 82.96] stroke so in summary high blood
[79.48 - 86.48] pressures damage blood vessels damaged
[82.96 - 89.32] blood vessels can form clots clots can
[86.48 - 91.96] block blood flow to the brain hence
[89.32 - 94.84] causing a stroke the good news is many
[91.96 - 97.60] strokes can be prevented regular
[94.84 - 101.00] exercise a healthy diet and managing
[97.60 - 103.52] stress are the crucial steps 70% of all
[101.00 - 106.24] Strokes can be prevented by adopting a
[103.52 - 108.64] healthy lifestyle what to do let's start
[106.24 - 111.16] with nutrition here are some simple
[108.64 - 113.00] changes so my first tip from a nutrition
[111.16 - 116.60] point of view is to spice it up Indian
[113.00 - 119.12] spices like turmeric Hali cumin jira and
[116.60 - 121.36] coriander da are known for their health
[119.12 - 123.60] benefits use them generously in your
[121.36 - 125.44] cooking to enhance flavor and it also
[123.60 - 127.64] reduces the need for excessive salt
[125.44 - 129.80] another key point no fried foods one big
[127.64 - 132.08] wayte to cut down on all the sodium
[129.80 - 134.64] which is in there of the processed foods
[132.08 - 136.56] which account for 75% of all the sodium
[134.64 - 138.52] in the food supply chain cut down your
[136.56 - 141.12] French fries cut down your fried chips
[138.52 - 143.52] cut down your packaged foods that are
[141.12 - 145.52] baked or fried they tend to have a
[143.52 - 148.44] higher sodium content not to mention the
[145.52 - 151.08] oil content another great tip is that I
[148.44 - 153.28] always add onion and garlic to my food
[151.08 - 156.32] they're full of potent cloth fighting
[153.28 - 158.56] compounds such as allisin now allisin is
[156.32 - 160.68] a sulfur containing compound
[158.56 - 162.24] specifically found in garlic and is
[160.68 - 164.48] believed to have blood thinning
[162.24 - 166.64] properties so the thinner your blood the
[164.48 - 169.56] better your flow lesser the chances of
[166.64 - 172.08] blood clots flavonoids this is found
[169.56 - 174.76] both in onion and garlic and has
[172.08 - 176.84] tremendous antioxidant and
[174.76 - 179.20] anti-inflammatory or reducing the
[176.84 - 181.32] inflammation inside your blood vessels
[179.20 - 183.72] these comp compounds can actually help
[181.32 - 185.08] prevent blood clots by inhibiting
[183.72 - 186.60] platelet aggregation meaning the
[185.08 - 188.88] platelets don't come together and Clump
[186.60 - 191.12] up and it also reduces inflammation and
[188.88 - 193.12] both of these factors plat agregation
[191.12 - 195.24] and reducing inflammation are a factor
[193.12 - 197.04] for stroke many years ago I decided to
[195.24 - 198.96] give up drinking normal tea and I added
[197.04 - 200.60] green tea to my diet now I drank two
[198.96 - 203.00] cups of green tea every day for the last
[200.60 - 204.96] decade and the reason was a 1967 study
[203.00 - 207.36] that had researched on where they saw
[204.96 - 209.60] rabbits in a British scientific journal
[207.36 - 210.96] and there was photos of the aota which
[209.60 - 213.08] is is the blood vessel going to the
[210.96 - 216.40] heart now they fed these rabbits a high
[213.08 - 218.68] fat diet one group they gave them water
[216.40 - 221.00] and another group they gave them the tea
[218.68 - 223.64] now the rabbits that got the tea
[221.00 - 225.44] exhibited only onethird of Artery damage
[223.64 - 228.28] as compared to the guys who got water so
[225.44 - 230.52] greeny has been an amazing addition to
[228.28 - 232.44] protect my blood vessels yes you can say
[230.52 - 234.32] it's a rabbit study but you know what I
[232.44 - 236.32] like to run fast in life and I do
[234.32 - 238.88] believe that I eat carrots like a bunny
[236.32 - 242.20] so please add green tea to your life now
[238.88 - 245.92] if you can there's another tip consume
[242.20 - 248.24] fish specifically fatty fish the fatty
[245.92 - 250.52] fish literally changes the shape of
[248.24 - 253.04] blood platelets so they can't lock
[250.52 - 254.88] together and form unwanted blood clocks
[253.04 - 257.56] while not as widely consumed as in some
[254.88 - 259.88] Western countries certain Indian fish
[257.56 - 264.48] varieties such as Indian salmon salmon
[259.88 - 268.04] mackerel sardines anues are all rich in
[264.48 - 270.28] Omega-3s this omega-3 is what protects
[268.04 - 273.32] your platelets and reduces es your blood
[270.28 - 275.44] clots another good source of Omega-3 is
[273.32 - 278.12] krill oil this supplement is derived
[275.44 - 280.92] from Krill a tiny crustation and is a
[278.12 - 284.72] great source of Omega-3s especially the
[280.92 - 287.88] EPA also alal oil for vegetarians and
[284.72 - 290.28] vegans the algae in the ocean the oil
[287.88 - 293.04] taken from them offers plant-based
[290.28 - 294.76] sources of Omega-3 another favorite that
[293.04 - 296.96] I recommend at my Quan nutrition clinics
[294.76 - 299.24] when I practice is flax seeds and chia
[296.96 - 301.72] seeds both these superfoods contain
[299.24 - 304.48] veget forms of Omega-3 and they can be
[301.72 - 306.88] added to your yogurt smoothies or salads
[304.48 - 309.16] another great one Indian mustard while
[306.88 - 311.40] it contains smaller amounts of Omega-3
[309.16 - 313.20] as compared to fish or seeds Indian
[311.40 - 315.28] mustard can still contribute to your
[313.20 - 317.92] overall intake another thing that's
[315.28 - 320.32] missing in India is we're not having
[317.92 - 322.64] enough of salad please have at least one
[320.32 - 325.44] serving of salad in a day and include
[322.64 - 327.28] carrots in those why do I say carrots
[325.44 - 331.64] well there was a Norwegian study done on
[327.28 - 334.60] men who ate the most vegetable had a 45%
[331.64 - 336.64] lower risk of stroke and carrots have
[334.60 - 338.20] something called as beta carotene a
[336.64 - 341.24] pigment found both in fruits and
[338.20 - 343.76] vegetables where the body converts it
[341.24 - 346.36] into vitamin A and this actually
[343.76 - 349.08] prevents Stroke by reducing oxidative
[346.36 - 352.20] stress so eating one karat a day can
[349.08 - 356.20] slash your stroke Risk by
[352.20 - 357.96] 68% another silent hero is potassium
[356.20 - 360.36] whilst in my clinic when I practice I
[357.96 - 362.60] want to reduce sodium
[360.36 - 364.60] I love to increase potassium because it
[362.60 - 367.00] can reduce your stroke chances by up to
[364.60 - 370.12] 40% and this was an analysis done on a
[367.00 - 372.08] group of about 859 men and women in
[370.12 - 374.84] Southern California USA and they were at
[372.08 - 377.48] risk of stroke it showed that potassium
[374.84 - 379.64] regulates your blood pressure so what
[377.48 - 381.72] are the potassium rich Indian foods and
[379.64 - 385.12] what could be the dosage this is my
[381.72 - 388.32] advice to you banana one banana medium
[385.12 - 391.56] size contains 420 Mig of potassium notee
[388.32 - 394.64] that down spinach poock one cup of
[391.56 - 397.08] cooked spinach contains about 890 mg of
[394.64 - 399.20] potassium potato who would think the
[397.08 - 402.60] potato would have potassium but with the
[399.20 - 405.28] skin it contains about 925 mg of
[402.60 - 408.60] potassium tomato 1 medium tomato
[405.28 - 411.08] contains about 280 mg of potassium so
[408.60 - 412.28] when you reach a balanced diet of these
[411.08 - 415.72] you should be getting enough of
[412.28 - 418.16] pottassium rajma nobody talks about it 1
[415.72 - 421.52] cup 200 g of cooked rajma contains
[418.16 - 423.76] approximately 7 140 mg of potassium not
[421.52 - 425.44] to mention that the fiber rajma is
[423.76 - 427.80] amazing for blood pressure and
[425.44 - 430.16] prevention of blood clots almonds my
[427.80 - 433.28] favorite 10 to 12 pieces of almond
[430.16 - 434.92] contain about 100 mg of potassium so
[433.28 - 437.04] I've given you in this entire list
[434.92 - 439.72] revine the video watch it again note it
[437.04 - 443.96] down because you need to have a daily
[439.72 - 445.76] intake of 4700 mg of potassium most
[443.96 - 448.32] people are getting high sodium and very
[445.76 - 450.12] low potassium bump up your potassium for
[448.32 - 452.52] your BP blood pressure pressure stroke
[450.12 - 454.84] issues now you have to limit salt I
[452.52 - 457.20] can't stress enough that how reducing
[454.84 - 459.28] Salt drops your blood pressure you know
[457.20 - 460.88] cutting back on salt even if it does not
[459.28 - 462.64] raise your blood pressure has huge
[460.88 - 465.92] benefits you see there was this one
[462.64 - 469.76] study on rats where all the rats was fed
[465.92 - 472.52] a high salt diet and they died within 15
[469.76 - 476.00] weeks and those that were on a low salt
[472.52 - 478.36] diet only 12% of the rats died so it is
[476.00 - 480.24] given to know that doctors worldwide
[478.36 - 481.88] over when do you have BP say cut salt
[480.24 - 484.72] cut salt cut salt and that's what you
[481.88 - 486.76] need to do now when you eat outside food
[484.72 - 488.36] you have no control over the salt when
[486.76 - 490.68] you eat junk food you have no control of
[488.36 - 492.60] the salt which is why homecooked
[490.68 - 495.64] designing your food at home is very
[492.60 - 499.08] important by the way in this rat study
[495.64 - 501.08] even the high salt rats brains it
[499.08 - 503.84] revealed in autopsies that there were
[501.08 - 506.12] injured arteries and dead tissue caused
[503.84 - 508.44] by a series of mini strokes in those
[506.12 - 510.56] rats before they died so Food For
