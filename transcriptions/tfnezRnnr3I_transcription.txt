[0.08 - 4.72] hey guys if you're not able to watch my
[2.28 - 7.44] long form content of podcast here are
[4.72 - 9.20] some short form clips for you to enjoy
[7.44 - 11.96] how do you convince people how do you
[9.20 - 13.88] convince women that muscle is important
[11.96 - 16.96] I always say muscle is an age reversible
[13.88 - 19.64] organ yeah but obviously you meet them
[16.96 - 21.88] in your class you do dance but you
[19.64 - 24.40] encourage them to do resistance training
[21.88 - 27.00] so what's your take on on muscle for
[24.40 - 28.44] women I say the same thing that you say
[27.00 - 30.08] by the way that muscle is the only age
[28.44 - 33.44] reversible organ in the body and I I
[30.08 - 37.36] think more than anything else um we want
[33.44 - 41.16] to age gracefully right aging gracefully
[37.36 - 43.12] is is denied to most people like I look
[41.16 - 46.04] at my own parents today and I'm like
[43.12 - 48.20] they're they're 70 they've been fairly
[46.04 - 53.44] active all their life Etc but they don't
[48.20 - 55.56] have the strength so being active and
[53.44 - 58.48] you know not having the strength when
[55.56 - 62.48] you're at 70 doesn't match doesn't make
[58.48 - 63.96] sense but if you build enough strength
[62.48 - 66.00] by doing the right amount of resistance
[63.96 - 68.68] training weight training at least two to
[66.00 - 70.36] three times a week you are going to be
[68.68 - 72.16] able to age gracefully I mean you need
[70.36 - 73.84] the muscle mass you need your joints to
[72.16 - 77.44] function better you need a strong
[73.84 - 80.96] posterior chain to be able to walk
[77.44 - 82.40] without losing balance at 70 75 80 right
[80.96 - 84.44] but you know we keep saying this to our
[82.40 - 86.72] parents you need to wait train and stuff
[84.44 - 89.08] like that and I think nobody told that
[86.72 - 90.92] to them in their 20s 30s and 40s so they
[89.08 - 93.76] cannot develop up a new skill set in
[90.92 - 95.92] their 50s and 60s I agree but even at
[93.76 - 98.68] 50s and 60s to start doing some
[95.92 - 102.00] unilateral training and V not too late
[98.68 - 103.96] amazing impact yes in fact I would like
[102.00 - 106.80] to share with people there was this uh
[103.96 - 109.04] scientific research done which was these
[106.80 - 110.56] old age people they put them in a home
[109.04 - 112.60] yeah and in one part of the home they
[110.56 - 114.96] gave them board games and in another
[112.60 - 117.96] part of the uh old age home they gave
[114.96 - 120.16] them a gym resistant training chiefly
[117.96 - 121.88] leg extension 6 months later did the
[120.16 - 124.08] biopsy of the two groups the board game
[121.88 - 126.44] group and the knee extension group who
[124.08 - 129.72] did exercise and they found that muscle
[126.44 - 131.60] regressed by 6 years at the age of 72 so
[129.72 - 135.72] I think it's very keen to understand
[131.60 - 137.76] that um we have to encourage women to
[135.72 - 140.76] work out and you're a living proof
[137.76 - 144.00] example of it whil you publicly told us
[140.76 - 148.28] your age is 43 yes but her metabolic age
[144.00 - 150.32] is 31 so she's far a decade younger and
[148.28 - 152.28] I meet so many women in the clinic and
[150.32 - 155.60] that's why I was so inspired to have
[152.28 - 159.52] shamri as my first female guest on board
[155.60 - 161.88] because the paradigm shift is that women
[159.52 - 164.36] need to take care of their bodies yes
[161.88 - 167.76] they cannot have an excuse of husband
[164.36 - 169.40] children career yeah and our hormones
[167.76 - 171.40] you you you oh yeah we have only one
[169.40 - 173.88] hormone testosterone you have multiple
[171.40 - 176.08] hormones exactly if you want to like
[173.88 - 178.16] really keep that balance with the
[176.08 - 180.28] hormones and Etc there's nothing better
[178.16 - 181.76] than weight training nothing better than
[180.28 - 183.44] weight training and also training
[181.76 - 185.48] according to your cycle so on and so
[183.44 - 188.72] forth there's like there's we can go
[185.48 - 191.00] into depth of that later but every woman
[188.72 - 195.28] must pick up weights and it doesn't have
[191.00 - 197.88] to be heavy light or heavy the choice is
[195.28 - 199.44] ours we figure over a period of Time how
[197.88 - 202.56] important is it to have a personal
[199.44 - 204.12] trainer well it depends on a goal I
[202.56 - 207.36] think having a personal trainer is
[204.12 - 209.32] phenomenal it can really change the way
[207.36 - 210.88] you train because you would have seen a
[209.32 - 213.32] version of yourself which you wouldn't
[210.88 - 214.84] otherwise see in a group class because
[213.32 - 216.24] here the focus is just you right the
[214.84 - 218.72] trainer is trying to get the best out of
[216.24 - 220.76] you so I think everyone can experience
[218.72 - 222.96] getting a personal trainer to really
[220.76 - 224.20] identify what they're capable of and to
[222.96 - 226.40] have all the you know the right
[224.20 - 228.80] correction guidance postural changes and
[226.40 - 231.44] Etc but since personal training is
[228.80 - 234.64] expensive I would say even if you do you
[231.44 - 237.88] know group classes but if you wait
[234.64 - 240.60] train how often do you weit train every
[237.88 - 242.88] day you weit train every day is Sunday a
[240.60 - 245.04] rest day Sunday is yeah rest day I try
[242.88 - 247.56] to do some Mobility on Sunday at home
[245.04 - 250.76] with my daughter uh she's just I mean I
[247.56 - 252.88] do it she just jumps jumps in but um
[250.76 - 254.56] Saturday mostly would be a long run
[252.88 - 257.24] because I enjoy running and I feel like
[254.56 - 261.48] the human body is naturally designed to
[257.24 - 263.96] run so we can't kind of lose that you
[261.48 - 265.96] know ability and mobility and everything
[263.96 - 268.08] so weight training is something that's
[265.96 - 271.08] that's it should be non-negotiable for
[268.08 - 273.40] all women uh not just from a strength
[271.08 - 277.88] point of view because personally for me
[273.40 - 280.64] it's made me a very confident person
[277.88 - 282.32] nothing no education no you know
[280.64 - 284.48] different types of jobs has been able to
[282.32 - 286.96] give me the confidence that weight
[284.48 - 290.16] training has given me so yeah it just
[286.96 - 292.12] boosts your confidence five workouts
[290.16 - 294.36] that you would give any woman out there
[292.12 - 297.40] watching five workouts like she doesn't
[294.36 - 299.28] have time she has 20 minutes in the day
[297.40 - 301.00] yeah five exercises that she could do
[299.28 - 303.92] maybe five workouts is the wrong thing
[301.00 - 306.12] yeah exercise five exercises plank it's
[303.92 - 308.48] what your core and your spine really
[306.12 - 311.84] needs so it's mandatory and how much
[308.48 - 316.40] should a person hold a plank honestly
[311.84 - 318.24] even 45 seconds 60 seconds is more than
[316.40 - 319.80] enough I mean we don't want anyone to
[318.24 - 323.52] hold for 10 minutes and 5 minutes it's
[319.80 - 326.00] not a challenge right you do a 30 to 45
[323.52 - 328.08] seconds flank and repeat like three to
[326.00 - 331.64] five and what should be the rest in
[328.08 - 335.00] between 15 seconds 15 second yeah more
[331.64 - 337.32] than enough 15 that's flat squats
[335.00 - 340.24] foundational movement especially if you
[337.32 - 342.48] can learn to deep squat if you practice
[340.24 - 344.92] about 10 minutes of deep Squat and you
[342.48 - 346.72] can accumulate there's there's one
[344.92 - 348.96] Instagram video of you talking about
[346.72 - 350.72] this even from a constipation point of
[348.96 - 353.16] view bow movement point of view and
[350.72 - 355.36] everything yes it's what we if you
[353.16 - 357.84] notice a toddler an infant to a toddler
[355.36 - 359.80] when they move squatting deep squatting
[357.84 - 361.24] is the first movement you know want to
[359.80 - 363.80] share something with you and share with
[361.24 - 366.28] all the women out there I recently went
[363.80 - 368.40] for a wellness Retreat and there were a
[366.28 - 370.16] phenomenal number of women over there
[368.40 - 372.84] and we were doing a yoga class where we
[370.16 - 375.40] had to go into a squat Po and I can tell
[372.84 - 377.92] you without a doubt about 80% of the
[375.40 - 379.92] women were not squatting properly they
[377.92 - 381.36] were on their toes or they were half
[379.92 - 383.28] squatted but they couldn't get into a
[381.36 - 386.16] deep squat so I think this is something
[383.28 - 388.84] that's crucial that women if you can't
[386.16 - 392.84] squat well and hold that position and
[388.84 - 395.68] then get up we need to really work on
[392.84 - 397.76] this with your trainer yes with you
[395.68 - 401.48] practicing it on a daily basis what's
[397.76 - 404.68] the third exercise okay squat plank
[401.48 - 407.00] lunges because lunges allows you to
[404.68 - 408.68] focus on balance and stability which is
[407.00 - 410.96] what you need as you age because as we
[408.68 - 413.56] age we lose balance and stability
[410.96 - 415.24] because it's a single leg movement it
[413.56 - 416.92] allows you to focus on balance and
[415.24 - 419.00] stability and excellent for your glute
[416.92 - 420.68] for your butt butt being the largest
[419.00 - 423.76] muscle and know how we need to keep it
[420.68 - 425.76] really strong uh also recent some
[423.76 - 427.68] studies show about how your posterior
[425.76 - 430.24] training especially your glutes and your
[427.68 - 432.00] hips can help in longevity because
[430.24 - 435.76] you're going to avoid more Falls and
[432.00 - 437.44] stuff like that so lunges right uh
[435.76 - 440.20] something that can take the heart rate
[437.44 - 443.64] up and can give you a you know a great
[440.20 - 445.92] quick cardio activity burpees it's my
[443.64 - 448.24] favorite Yona does my little one does
[445.92 - 450.20] burpees like with the finest technique
[448.24 - 452.76] and she learned it on her own but
[450.20 - 455.32] burpees is phenomenal for a quick burst
[452.76 - 458.08] of cardio you know you suddenly hit like
[455.32 - 459.96] zone three zone four come back so it's
[458.08 - 462.04] phenomenal the last
[459.96 - 464.28] exercise I don't know if this is an
[462.04 - 466.64] exercise but I feel every human being
[464.28 - 469.20] must walk more I was about to add this
[466.64 - 471.08] as my sixth one she came in so yes we've
[469.20 - 473.52] got walking tell us about walking and
[471.08 - 477.64] why oh my God I
[473.52 - 479.52] mean it's just what we're supposed to do
[477.64 - 481.04] I know we could have done this podcast
[479.52 - 482.80] Al walking but then there'll be too much
[481.04 - 484.16] distraction but walking is just
[482.80 - 487.64] something you're supposed to do and
[484.16 - 489.28] walking is best for fat loss I mean so
[487.64 - 491.44] many people struggling out there to Fat
[489.28 - 493.20] Loss you eat right you walk a lot you'll
[491.44 - 495.88] see that fat kind of melting away right
[493.20 - 498.32] it's one of your best Zone to training
[495.88 - 500.16] and we all need to do zone two training
[498.32 - 502.12] almost every day so it's the finest zone
[500.16 - 504.08] two training it's what the body is
[502.12 - 507.16] designed to do like we say sitting is a
[504.08 - 509.08] new smoking yeah awesome and I always
[507.16 - 511.56] tell people that when I work with the
[509.08 - 513.36] films Stars One prescription to all of
[511.56 - 516.68] them is please walk and they look at me
[513.36 - 518.92] very quizzically but to fat burn when
[516.68 - 522.84] you are walking your heart rate is in
[518.92 - 525.92] that targeted Zone where the substrate
[522.84 - 527.92] utilization meaning the source of fuel
[525.92 - 529.80] inside your body is not glycogen from
[527.92 - 532.52] the muscle which is the carb but
[529.80 - 536.12] actually fat the higher you go in your
[532.52 - 538.68] heart rate the more is glycogen as a
[536.12 - 541.12] fuel or a Battery Source the lower the
[538.68 - 542.44] intensity the more the fat you burn
[541.12 - 546.00] which is why we have something known as
[542.44 - 548.60] neat non exercise adaptive thermogenesis
[546.00 - 550.84] which is what your mother and what my
[548.60 - 552.68] mother and our grandparents did which is
[550.84 - 555.16] being fidgety around the house and
[552.68 - 556.48] cleaning and cooking and jaru and POA
[555.16 - 558.32] which is why a lot of you in the
[556.48 - 560.08] pandemic lost weight because the
[558.32 - 561.44] housekeeping didn't turn up so you were
[560.08 - 564.48] fidgeting you were constantly on the
[561.44 - 566.88] Move now speaking of constantly on the
