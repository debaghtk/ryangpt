Transcript: hi uh my name is ryan fernando and a sports nutritionist yesterday's french open semi-final rafael nadal in june 2022 uh had his opponent alexander retired her due to a broken ankle now many of you may ask how does you know you've not seen many people break the ankles live on court my take is a nutritionist and i've had a few athletes actually break their bones during tournaments practice etc i had robin singh famous footballer a massive guy break his anchor the underlining story is nutrition deficiency or nutrition excess hear me out on this okay because once i explain it it'll you'll get the logic as an athlete you see when you're an athlete you take a lot of protein so when you take a lot of protein protein tends to be acidic in nature so when you put it in your body it raises the the the acidity level of the human body so the ph drops now normally when we eat a lot of vegetables and fruits the body becomes more alkaline so when you take a lot of protein imagine the protein making the blood acidic so now when the blood is acidic the bones have calcium so the calcium says hey boss i can make the blood more alkaline if i dump some calcium into the blood so the calcium begins to leach out of the bones in acidic environment because of high protein diet at least take high protein because of high amounts of fitness but they don't balance it with fruits and vegetables second point there are genetic receptors for the absorption of calcium magnesium and vitamin d i predict that if we do a test for alexander in his calcium magnesium and vitamin d he will be chronically low this is what has happened for many athletes that i have tested who have had bone injuries poor broken bones so nutritional discipline by eating more protein but not taking enough of fruits and vegetables not checking your acid-base balance in your body and not checking your vitamin d levels could lead to career ending injuries could lead to catastrophic events like the recent french open so food for thought protein high bone leeches bone is brittle bone breaks under high athletic competitive pressure vitamin d causes bone formation to be better vitamin d lacking calcium lacking magnesium lacking can also cause for your bone to not have the raw material to be tagged thank you ryan fernando food for thought
