Transcript:
[0.12 - 5.20] you trained ranir Kapoor in that role
[3.16 - 8.04] but could you just tell us like how
[5.20 - 9.96] intense did it get when we started we
[8.04 - 12.88] were nowhere close to that so somewhere
[9.96 - 15.36] it had to start literally from Basics it
[12.88 - 17.24] can be achieved in a smaller time frame
[15.36 - 18.88] but it's not the healthiest way to
[17.24 - 21.00] approach it I know certain film stars
[18.88 - 24.04] even in the ' 80s who work out I needed
[21.00 - 26.32] to you know be in shape and started
[24.04 - 28.60] going to the gym what is it that one
[26.32 - 31.12] drives them to work out is it that
[28.60 - 32.60] celebrity paycheck that getting one F
[31.12 - 34.36] day the doctor just said you know we
[32.60 - 36.48] need to check you for osteoporosis then
[34.36 - 38.72] I started reading that stress excessive
[36.48 - 40.24] stress is somewhere connected to most of
[38.72 - 41.88] the lifestyle diseases and this we
[40.24 - 44.04] talking about cancer you know Cristiano
[41.88 - 46.96] Ronaldo says discipline but these guys
[44.04 - 49.48] have willpower so is there some sort of
[46.96 - 51.92] Mantra I Can chant or some beads I can
[49.48 - 53.40] wear yes there is a beautiful Mantra You
[51.92 - 56.76] Can chant because you believe in
[53.40 - 58.44] manifestation so the Mantra is I will
[56.76 - 60.60] not exercise but I can take care of the
[58.44 - 62.68] mind it does not work other way around
[60.60 - 64.52] also I can eat the healthiest of foods I
[62.68 - 66.28] can exercise regularly but I will not
[64.52 - 68.52] take care of the mind and the biggest
[66.28 - 71.51] reason for the elevated levels of Stress

[215.92 - 220.04] exercise I did CrossFit for 2 days and

[226.52 - 231.88] mind power that she has CrossFit you're
[229.56 - 234.12] a fit guy what is it and why did you
[231.88 - 237.80] bring CrossFit to India and what's your
[234.12 - 239.84] take on it so I um I was training
[237.80 - 242.52] already in Melbourne I was a personal
[239.84 - 244.96] Fitness coach already in Melbourne and I
[242.52 - 246.64] had a trainer everybody needs a trainer
[244.96 - 248.24] if everybody wants to get better you
[246.64 - 250.72] need a mentor you need a guide you need
[248.24 - 254.16] a trainer in some way or the other so I
[250.72 - 256.52] told him I want to learn handstands and
[254.16 - 259.20] month one month two month three we're
[256.52 - 261.48] trying just not getting it so one day we
[259.20 - 263.88] were on uh Google just looking up how to
[261.48 - 266.52] improve handstands and this crazy
[263.88 - 268.92] website opened up crossfit.com and we're
[266.52 - 271.28] like wow what is this website it looks
[268.92 - 273.12] kind of crazy very simple at that time
[271.28 - 274.84] there was the the websites it was
[273.12 - 276.24] literally like a simple blog just like a
[274.84 - 277.72] WordPress blog there was nothing there
[276.24 - 279.84] was no pictures nothing there was just
[277.72 - 281.76] the workout written maybe a small
[279.84 - 284.68] screenshot of some workout that's about
[281.76 - 286.44] it and I said looks interesting let's
[284.68 - 289.84] let's try it and the first workout we
[286.44 - 292.76] did was uh called Nate which was 20
[289.84 - 296.36] minutes as many rounds as possible of
[292.76 - 298.56] two muscleups for what are muscleups so
[296.36 - 300.68] muscleups is basically something where
[298.56 - 303.36] you kind of do a p up and then then you
[300.68 - 306.04] get over the bar and press like a
[303.36 - 307.76] gymnastic move basically yeah so muscle
[306.04 - 311.00] up two muscle ups four handstand
[307.76 - 313.48] push-ups and um eight Kettle belt swings
[311.00 - 316.76] that was my first workout 10 minutes
[313.48 - 319.44] into that workout I was blown away I was
[316.76 - 321.16] already throwing up in this big bin in
[319.44 - 323.36] Fitness First and people were wondering
[321.16 - 326.04] what the hell's going on and I was like
[323.36 - 329.44] oh my god I think I'm I think I found my
[326.04 - 331.40] thing this is this is this is it and
[329.44 - 333.04] that was the last day I probably
[331.40 - 335.36] remember doing any bicep curls or
[333.04 - 338.16] anything for like 15 years it was just
[335.36 - 340.64] CrossFit I don't know what it was but it
[338.16 - 343.12] it I think the reason why I loved it so
[340.64 - 345.28] much was probably because of the
[343.12 - 348.08] movements they were so beautiful when
[345.28 - 350.76] done correctly they make you feel very
[348.08 - 353.00] different but more than anything in
[350.76 - 354.32] those 20 minutes or 15 minutes or 10
[353.00 - 357.28] minutes or whatever the length of the
[354.32 - 360.56] workout was you could not think about
[357.28 - 363.08] anything else but the next rep all that
[360.56 - 365.24] is going through my head is Warrior mode
[363.08 - 367.88] it I would say definitely it would be a
[365.24 - 371.32] warrior Yogi mode like literally there
[367.88 - 373.68] was it was you're at it you're sweating
[371.32 - 375.88] you're you're grunting your whatever I
[373.68 - 379.48] never grunted in my workouts I remember
[375.88 - 382.04] I still don't but it literally did it
[379.48 - 384.60] allowed you to be in a space which was
[382.04 - 386.40] you could say it's like it's your cave
[384.60 - 388.64] you know your your space it didn't it
[386.40 - 390.84] literally didn't no matter what worry
[388.64 - 393.92] you you had in the world World it for
[390.84 - 397.96] those 20 minutes it just did not exist
[393.92 - 400.28] it was insane for 15 years I've done it
[397.96 - 401.28] the boxes franchises training clients
[400.28 - 404.04] training
[401.28 - 407.00] trainers I still do a lot of programming
[404.04 - 409.12] in CrossFit for a lot of clients and I
[407.00 - 410.76] absolutely love the movements that I've
[409.12 - 413.64] learned through CrossFit the power
[410.76 - 415.52] cleans the muscle ups the handstands a
[413.64 - 417.60] lot of movements which already existed
[415.52 - 419.60] they were just brought together by the
[417.60 - 422.84] founder of CrossFit to make it made it
[419.60 - 425.00] into this program but I feel that this
[422.84 - 427.48] was and this is like 15 years 20 years
[425.00 - 429.60] back almost but I feel that today and
[427.48 - 431.20] this is my perspective I can be wrong
[429.60 - 434.16] people have their own perspective but I
[431.20 - 435.64] feel that today my body is not the same
[434.16 - 438.76] just like what we were talking earlier
[435.64 - 440.68] about our bodies evolve over time things
[438.76 - 442.36] change you're not the same person how
[440.68 - 444.88] you were maybe even two years down the
[442.36 - 447.84] line uh two years back so today I feel
[444.88 - 450.56] CrossFit is definitely not the intensity
[447.84 - 453.04] of CrossFit is not a kind of intensity
[450.56 - 455.68] or workout that I can put my body
[453.04 - 460.12] through the healing is a little bit
[455.68 - 461.96] slower um you know it's not it's not
[460.12 - 463.36] ideal because I'm not competing anymore
[461.96 - 464.60] I'm not training for a goal at that time
[463.36 - 467.00] I was training for the CrossFit Games
[464.60 - 469.68] and I did all of that so the athlete
[467.00 - 471.48] mode was always there and vinda has
[469.68 - 473.52] taught me that to become a good coach
[471.48 - 475.88] you somewhere need to get out of that
[473.52 - 478.60] athlete mode you need to see yourself as
[475.88 - 480.96] a coach that competitiveness and all of
[478.60 - 482.60] that because I've been an all my life in
[480.96 - 484.84] National level swimmer water polo
[482.60 - 486.68] Captain all of that I've done all that
[484.84 - 489.52] so literally that athlete mode has
[486.68 - 492.16] always been there but to become a good
[489.52 - 493.96] coach to become a really good coach and
[492.16 - 496.36] for people to see you as a coach not an
[493.96 - 498.84] athlete you need to First transform
[496.36 - 501.32] yourself from that mentality of being an
[498.84 - 503.36] athlete to becoming a coach so I think
[501.32 - 505.56] from a coach perspective I still do a
[503.36 - 508.16] lot of the movements from Crossfit I do
[505.56 - 509.96] my deadlifts I do my cleans all of that
[508.16 - 512.68] I incorporate them in my work out but at
[509.96 - 515.76] a more I would say lower intensity so
[512.68 - 519.92] shiv basically what I'm hearing from you
[515.76 - 522.80] is that one there are different workouts
[519.92 - 525.04] and there's a certain time for you to do
[522.80 - 526.84] that workout in your life absolutely and
[525.04 - 529.44] it's very important that the coach who's
[526.84 - 531.76] coaching you should be able to kind of
[529.44 - 533.72] figure out your frequency absolutely but
[531.76 - 537.12] I love one concept where you said
[533.72 - 539.20] Warrior Yogi uh and and speaking of Yogi
[537.12 - 542.04] you said you go into a cave in your mind
[539.20 - 543.76] and you're just with any workout that
[542.04 - 546.04] you are there at that point in life now
[543.76 - 548.48] I do karate and when I do karate it's
[546.04 - 550.32] absolute Bliss for 60 Minutes corre even
[548.48 - 553.08] though you're sweating and you know well
[550.32 - 555.60] not puking in a bucket but uh you know
[553.08 - 559.36] it's it's at that so rinda I wanted to
[555.60 - 561.96] pick your mind on this part as a mind
[559.36 - 564.96] coach as a person who coaches people
[561.96 - 566.96] from mental grit motivation you know the
[564.96 - 569.48] law of attraction as we spoke earlier
[566.96 - 570.28] and I'm a huge believer of it I find all
[569.48 - 574.36] my
[570.28 - 576.48] clients giving me D Mara excuses so
[574.36 - 579.32] Shivam over here is a fit guy he's a
[576.48 - 580.40] former athlete he's a trainer he's a
[579.32 - 584.52] coach
[580.40 - 587.76] today but you and I sit in a counseling
[584.52 - 590.32] room and people come to us in the diet
[587.76 - 591.60] or the exercise or in your case the Mind
[590.32 - 595.72] space and
[591.60 - 597.76] say I can't do it where do we start to
[595.72 - 601.36] let people understand that the most
[597.76 - 603.72] powerful organ in the human body sorry
[601.36 - 606.96] is not the muscle no no no I I agree
[603.72 - 609.92] with it's the mind I agree with you 110%
[606.96 - 612.24] Ryan because when I started my career I
[609.92 - 613.92] started as a physical fitness coach and
[612.24 - 616.40] a dietician oh you were a physical
[613.92 - 618.56] fitness coach and a dietician yes so I
[616.40 - 619.84] actually met at her Studio she used to
[618.56 - 623.92] have a studio what was love at first
[619.84 - 625.88] sight uh later later no it wasn't it was
[623.92 - 628.04] a spiritual bond at first sight I would
[625.88 - 629.88] say but coming back to I started as a
[628.04 - 633.92] physical fitness coach that's what I was
[629.88 - 635.80] telling you earlier uh and over time
[633.92 - 637.72] literally in three or four years I start
[635.80 - 640.52] I was one of the first female fitness
[637.72 - 644.64] coaches in the country this is
[640.52 - 647.44] 1998 so and came to Mumbai got very
[644.64 - 649.24] lucky got blessed with great clients
[647.44 - 653.20] started training Mr batan in physical
[649.24 - 656.60] fitness in the year 2000 one second yeah
[653.20 - 658.88] I thought he trained Mr batan and Ki no
[656.60 - 660.32] no now he does it but I was his first
[658.88 - 662.28] physical Fitness coach so you were the
[660.32 - 663.92] first physical fitness Co wow yes and
[662.28 - 665.48] I've been training him since for 24
[663.92 - 669.20] years now I train the mind and he does
[665.48 - 671.80] the body okay but uh yes so as I moved
[669.20 - 674.40] along and of course nutrition and
[671.80 - 676.28] exercise are inseparable they both have
[674.40 - 677.56] to go hand in hand and my journey
[676.28 - 679.56] actually started when I was a teenager
[677.56 - 682.20] and I had to lose weight so did
[679.56 - 683.44] everything wrong got osteoporosis at the
[682.20 - 685.68] age of
[683.44 - 688.28] 1920 and then how did you how did you
[685.68 - 690.16] know you had osteoporosis it diagnosed a
[688.28 - 692.60] story that is a story because I could
[690.16 - 694.76] not walk suddenly One Fine Day not one
[692.60 - 697.44] fine day it started deteriorating over
[694.76 - 699.60] time and I could not walk straight I
[697.44 - 702.20] started limping my whole body would go
[699.60 - 703.68] into spasms it would take me 30 seconds
[702.20 - 705.96] to move from one side of the bed to the
[703.68 - 707.60] other just turn side and bed and nobody
[705.96 - 709.52] could figure out because I was so young
[707.60 - 713.16] and there was no awareness at that point
[709.52 - 715.28] of time about good nutrition and proper
[713.16 - 717.60] exercise so I used to just watch those
[715.28 - 719.64] Jane Fonda video tapes used to be there
[717.60 - 722.80] and nutrition only thing Ryan at that
[719.64 - 724.40] point of time was no fat remove the fat
[722.80 - 727.96] everything has to be fat free that was a
[724.40 - 730.24] decade of slim milk yes and no protein
[727.96 - 733.00] so only carb only high carb diet that's
[730.24 - 735.08] all he's supposed to have so I actually
[733.00 - 737.60] unfortunately had boiled vegetables for
[735.08 - 740.20] seven years so lost all the weight lost
[737.60 - 742.96] Oodles of weight and lost my health
[740.20 - 745.60] which uh when I figured out that the one
[742.96 - 746.56] find day the doctor just said that you
[745.60 - 748.64] know we need to check you for
[746.56 - 750.72] osteoporosis which is very unlikely
[748.64 - 752.88] doesn't happen to young people but let's
[750.72 - 755.84] check and when they found out yes they
[752.88 - 757.72] said if you sneeze too loudly your
[755.84 - 760.72] literally your ribs are going to crack
[757.72 - 763.96] so be very very careful so that's the
[760.72 - 766.20] time when I realized that hello health
[763.96 - 768.40] is way more important than just
[766.20 - 770.68] Aesthetics and I decided okay when I
[768.40 - 772.52] came to Mumbai I said I'm going to learn
[770.68 - 775.00] understand nutrition I'm going to
[772.52 - 776.68] understand sensible training and that
[775.00 - 779.96] was it and the journey was going fine
[776.68 - 783.48] with that and then very uh literally in
[779.96 - 787.44] by 2003 or 4 my father who was always
[783.48 - 791.48] into healthy eating and he was uh always
[787.44 - 795.24] exercising very fit no Vibes whatso no
[791.48 - 796.64] bad habits what vies whatsoever and uh
[795.24 - 799.88] he was diagnosed with
[796.64 - 803.60] cancer and then my brother's son was
[799.88 - 806.12] diagnosed with cancer I was wondering no
[803.60 - 808.64] what could a child do wrong it's not
[806.12 - 810.24] about diet and exercise for the child
[808.64 - 813.08] and my my father did everything right
[810.24 - 815.36] why did he fall sick so that is when I
[813.08 - 818.00] started going deeper into the Mind mind
[815.36 - 820.12] was somewhere always coming along as
[818.00 - 822.56] completing the picture but then mind
[820.12 - 824.72] became a bigger Focus then I started
[822.56 - 827.20] reading that stress excessive stress is
[824.72 - 828.76] somewh connected to most of the
[827.20 - 832.20] lifestyle diseases and this we talking
[828.76 - 834.72] about cancer so started reading more
[832.20 - 836.72] about it started uh understanding the
[834.72 - 840.00] yogic scriptures reading the yogic
[836.72 - 841.76] scriptures and around this time I came
[840.00 - 844.96] across the power of human
[841.76 - 846.68] mind uh which was I always believed in
[844.96 - 849.84] it there was a book called The Power of
[846.68 - 851.48] the subconscious mind by Dr Murphy and I
[849.84 - 854.32] read it and I was just blown away I was
[851.48 - 857.00] like oh my God and then when I reflected
[854.32 - 860.52] back in how I got the weight loss or how
[857.00 - 862.80] I did anything it started with the mind
[860.52 - 864.44] so when I'm saying mind people are
[862.80 - 867.16] people have a very vague concept when I
[864.44 - 868.52] say mind people think moods I'm saying
[867.16 - 869.92] yes moods is something that you learn
[868.52 - 872.24] the stress and anxiety something that
[869.92 - 873.92] you learn in the beginning yes how to
[872.24 - 875.64] handle it on a day-to-day basis how to
[873.92 - 878.56] minimize it because they both have a
[875.64 - 881.56] function in the body but when I'm saying
[878.56 - 883.80] mind I'm saying skills that the mind has
[881.56 - 886.04] the first is Clarity you need to be
[883.80 - 887.72] clear of a goal like you said your
[886.04 - 889.12] clients come to you once they have
[887.72 - 890.40] Clarity okay this is my goal whether
[889.12 - 892.40] it's weight loss whether it's getting my
[890.40 - 894.88] health back one you have Clarity you'll
[892.40 - 897.12] give them the clarity then they need a
[894.88 - 898.84] willpower people think people are born
[897.12 - 900.16] yes some people are born with willpower
[898.84 - 903.00] you they're raised around people with
[900.16 - 905.16] will power but it it is a skill will is
[903.00 - 908.56] a skill that can be developed that is
[905.16 - 911.44] what I teach then you need discipline
[908.56 - 914.16] discipline when I say I somewhere I find
[911.44 - 915.12] motivation overrated I think discipline
[914.16 - 918.56] is a
[915.12 - 920.60] GameChanger when you have discipline
[918.56 - 923.56] discipline is more important than
[920.60 - 925.28] willpower is what you're saying H will
[923.56 - 927.24] they're connected okay initially when
[925.28 - 929.84] you start on a journey you'll need
[927.24 - 931.40] willpower you'll need okay I'm going
[929.84 - 935.28] against my will I need to get up go to
[931.40 - 936.48] the gym you do it often enough today I
[935.28 - 938.20] don't have to think about going to the
[936.48 - 941.48] gym I love it it's a
[938.20 - 943.28] discipline you just get up and you do it
[941.48 - 947.08] do you have to think twice before eating
[943.28 - 949.60] healthy no it's a discipline we this
[947.08 - 953.60] morning I was watching um a beautiful
[949.60 - 955.16] podcast which featured Cristiano Ronaldo
[953.60 - 957.56] and he spoke about discipline he's like
[955.16 - 959.56] you just show up you show up whether you
[957.56 - 962.16] like it you don't like it that question
[959.56 - 964.68] is not crossing your mind you just do it
[962.16 - 968.16] a brand made a beautiful logo out of it
[964.68 - 970.60] just do it just do it yes so I think
[968.16 - 972.52] when we work with our clients and we
[970.60 - 974.24] realize that well you may have an
[972.52 - 976.92] exercise schedule you have an exercise
[974.24 - 980.88] trainer you have a diet plan you have a
[976.92 - 983.32] diet coach uh unless the individual says
[980.88 - 988.16] in the mind this is something I want to
[983.32 - 991.16] do and I if I do this with enough of
[988.16 - 994.20] discipline I'll get my desired goal now
[991.16 - 998.08] shivom when we talk about goals I did
[994.20 - 1000.48] not know that she trained Mr amitab G
[998.08 - 1003.64] first but you trained him in ki as a
[1000.48 - 1007.16] role my dad and mom are 77 years of age
[1003.64 - 1009.20] our parents around that 70 parameter and
[1007.16 - 1011.40] when we tell them that our celebrities
[1009.20 - 1012.88] and film stars irrespective of the age
[1011.40 - 1015.40] especially those who are in the 50s to
[1012.88 - 1018.20] 60s 60 to 7s I know certain filmm Stars
[1015.40 - 1020.20] even in the 80s who work out right and
[1018.20 - 1023.88] they're not going for movies
[1020.20 - 1026.56] anymore so what is it that one drives
[1023.88 - 1028.64] them to work out is it that celebrity
[1026.56 - 1031.64] paycheck that they getting or do you see
[1028.64 - 1033.76] a different avar it's definitely not the
[1031.64 - 1036.28] paycheck or anything but I think at this
[1033.76 - 1039.32] point for Mr bachan for Amit G it is
[1036.28 - 1041.56] more about health and he recognizes it
[1039.32 - 1043.60] and he he says it himself he's like I
[1041.56 - 1045.72] know my body needs it he knows my body
[1043.60 - 1047.92] he's like I know my body needs to move
[1045.72 - 1049.72] every single day a little bit even if
[1047.92 - 1051.28] it's just the 10 minutes of treadmill
[1049.72 - 1053.92] even if it's just the stretches just the
[1051.28 - 1055.48] band work no matter what it is like so
[1053.92 - 1058.92] there are days when like right now when
[1055.48 - 1060.68] he's shooting for KBC we go to the set
[1058.92 - 1062.48] he doesn't have an hour to train
[1060.68 - 1064.28] normally when he has a break and we're
[1062.48 - 1067.24] training at home then it's a longer time
[1064.28 - 1069.68] but here we go we do like say 20 minutes
[1067.24 - 1072.88] just very simple just to get his body to
[1069.68 - 1075.52] move so are you saying 20 minutes for
[1072.88 - 1078.28] the general population irrespective of
[1075.52 - 1080.60] the age they just need that discipline
[1078.28 - 1082.44] first to start start with just turn up I
[1080.60 - 1085.52] mean research has proven even if you
[1082.44 - 1088.88] train for 20 minutes two to three times
[1085.52 - 1090.80] a week it's enough to see the benefits
[1088.88 - 1093.32] of weight training and exercise from a
[1090.80 - 1095.04] health perspective from an aesthetic
[1093.32 - 1097.64] perspective you might you definitely
[1095.04 - 1099.52] have to put more work into it but just
[1097.64 - 1102.20] from everything that happens within the
[1099.52 - 1104.16] body where exercise is a stimulus for
[1102.20 - 1105.84] the food to behave in a certain way to
[1104.16 - 1108.20] behave efficiently the hormones the
[1105.84 - 1109.84] chemicals the enzymes everything for the
[1108.20 - 1112.60] blood to ser circulate properly within
[1109.84 - 1114.92] the system for the circulation to happen
[1112.60 - 1116.52] 20 minutes of basic weight training
[1114.92 - 1120.00] basic exercise with little bit of
[1116.52 - 1123.00] movement is enough to see the benefit I
[1120.00 - 1126.08] think our most difficult part will be uh
[1123.00 - 1128.32] getting people to turn up correct and
[1126.08 - 1131.16] start a process correct everyone says
[1128.32 - 1134.44] tomorrow and and you own and have run
[1131.16 - 1137.40] gyms and you know that everyone joins on
[1134.44 - 1139.20] 1st of January to 15th of January but a
[1137.40 - 1141.16] sizable amount of population never come
[1139.20 - 1142.72] back again you just send them to me I'll
[1141.16 - 1145.04] help him develop the willpower and the
[1142.72 - 1147.84] discipline and that's where I'm
[1145.04 - 1151.32] wondering do our
[1147.84 - 1154.56] children have the least amount of mental
[1151.32 - 1157.48] training and is that and could that be a
[1154.56 - 1160.20] place where we need to start a million
[1157.48 - 1161.72] and 1% if that was ever a percentage
[1160.20 - 1165.32] because Ryan this morning when I was
[1161.72 - 1168.16] doing my uh mental coaching program I
[1165.32 - 1169.44] was I was talking about when I was
[1168.16 - 1172.84] overweight
[1169.44 - 1175.68] and somebody U body shamed me I was a
[1172.84 - 1178.12] kid I was 11 or 12 years old and I I'm
[1175.68 - 1180.32] grateful to the person who did that
[1178.12 - 1181.92] because I did it hurt of course it hurt
[1180.32 - 1183.84] but I did something about it what if he
[1181.92 - 1186.92] didn't what if I did not even know that
[1183.84 - 1189.16] something was something was not perfect
[1186.92 - 1193.44] not proper with me and I could rectify
[1189.16 - 1195.48] it so today's children today's
[1193.44 - 1197.00] youngsters I feel they have to
[1195.48 - 1200.24] psychologically
[1197.00 - 1201.96] become stronger and whose responsibility
[1200.24 - 1203.72] is that is it the child's or the parents
[1201.96 - 1206.12] responsibility to push the child towards
[1203.72 - 1208.12] mind coaching first is the parents
[1206.12 - 1210.64] because a lot of parents come to me they
[1208.12 - 1213.08] said please help my child I said first I
[1210.64 - 1216.56] need to speak to you so we parents need
[1213.08 - 1218.92] to lead by example 110% so when I am
[1216.56 - 1221.20] coaching uh families together I do
[1218.92 - 1223.72] coaching for families as well I would
[1221.20 - 1226.32] even I would go as early as before the
[1223.72 - 1229.32] child is born so when the mother is
[1226.32 - 1231.32] pregnant I coach them so so they start
[1229.32 - 1234.20] working on their willpower their
[1231.32 - 1237.48] discipline their Clarity their patience
[1234.20 - 1239.20] and by default those traits are getting
[1237.48 - 1241.32] transferred to the child and then they
[1239.20 - 1244.64] practice when they are doing their
[1241.32 - 1248.12] practices the baby is in their lab so
[1244.64 - 1250.24] you you talk about um discipline was
[1248.12 - 1252.52] more important and that's something that
[1250.24 - 1255.16] sh and I need in the exercise and the
[1252.52 - 1258.16] diet part but talk to us about will
[1255.16 - 1260.24] power I mean I keep hearing about Willow
[1258.16 - 1262.96] you know Christ Ronaldo says discipline
[1260.24 - 1265.52] but these guys have willpower so is
[1262.96 - 1269.64] there some sort of Mantra I Can chant or
[1265.52 - 1271.64] some beads I can we or or something yes
[1269.64 - 1272.88] yes there's a beautiful Mantra You Can
[1271.64 - 1277.00] chant because you believe in
[1272.88 - 1278.68] manifestation so the Mantra is you write
[1277.00 - 1281.16] and you tell yourself you look in the
[1278.68 - 1282.48] mirror and you tell yourself I have
[1281.16 - 1287.24] amazing
[1282.48 - 1289.44] willpower I have have amazing will power
[1287.24 - 1292.60] and then do one small activity to
[1289.44 - 1295.68] support that fact one tiny thing so I do
[1292.60 - 1297.56] the affirmation I have amazing willpower
[1295.68 - 1300.36] and then what is it that I'm going to be
[1297.56 - 1302.56] doing yes you have Clarity okay if there
[1300.36 - 1304.40] you need to do you need to go to the gym
[1302.56 - 1306.28] okay I would say start with just wearing
[1304.40 - 1309.20] a shoes that's very easy for his
[1306.28 - 1311.56] profession I have amazing willpower to H
[1309.20 - 1314.56] lift this kettle bell for Ryan Fernando
[1311.56 - 1317.60] it is I have amazing power willpower not
[1314.56 - 1320.68] to eat this ice cream of it works both
[1317.60 - 1322.56] ways will power is used to do a
[1320.68 - 1325.96] particular action or stop you from doing
[1322.56 - 1329.12] another action and by the end of it Ryan
[1325.96 - 1331.44] it is not about where you apply it a
[1329.12 - 1333.12] will a strong will is a strong will
[1331.44 - 1335.36] whether you apply it in business whether
[1333.12 - 1337.32] you apply it in uh diet whether you
[1335.36 - 1340.36] apply it in workout it is still your
[1337.32 - 1341.84] muscle you can use it it is a skill and
[1340.36 - 1344.56] there are so many there's a beautiful
[1341.84 - 1347.20] podcast by Andrew hubman where they are
[1344.56 - 1348.84] discussing that will and discipline are
[1347.20 - 1351.64] so deeply connected to your sleeping
[1348.84 - 1354.12] patterns as well to your diet to your
[1351.64 - 1355.96] daily routine to your lifestyle I'm glad
[1354.12 - 1357.72] you brought that up because you know my
[1355.96 - 1359.48] wife sometimes thinks I'm very crude
[1357.72 - 1361.44] because you know when somebody says oh
[1359.48 - 1363.28] that person has anxiety and depression
[1361.44 - 1365.68] or God forbid somebody committed suicide
[1363.28 - 1367.88] I'm like the sleep was not good the diet
[1365.68 - 1369.44] was not good the microbiome was not good
[1367.88 - 1372.36] and that's why they felt miserable for
[1369.44 - 1374.60] the last maybe four 5 10 years yes and
[1372.36 - 1376.84] therefore they are in in that what we
[1374.60 - 1381.72] call as depression or anxiety
[1376.84 - 1385.32] mode so have you had cases where minus
[1381.72 - 1388.08] diet minus exercise the mind is still
[1385.32 - 1389.68] powerful on its own beautiful question
[1388.08 - 1392.44] Ryan let give me some time I need to
[1389.68 - 1393.88] explain what a human system is because
[1392.44 - 1395.52] otherwise this is the biggest
[1393.88 - 1397.32] misconception people have that they
[1395.52 - 1399.64] think that mind is some separate entity
[1397.32 - 1401.48] and the body is something separate so
[1399.64 - 1404.40] according to the yogic
[1401.48 - 1406.84] wisdom we have a physical body which is
[1404.40 - 1408.72] called the aname Kos we have a subtler
[1406.84 - 1411.00] body which is called the pran Kos which
[1408.72 - 1413.44] is your 72,000 naris are there your
[1411.00 - 1415.68] chakras are there subtler than that is a
[1413.44 - 1418.36] manomos which is your mental emotional
[1415.68 - 1422.36] body and then there's vay Kos and the
[1418.36 - 1424.96] Anand Kos they all are inextricably
[1422.36 - 1427.36] connected you can't say I will not take
[1424.96 - 1429.56] care of about the body I will eat all
[1427.36 - 1432.64] the rubbish in the world rubbish means
[1429.56 - 1434.40] it is doesn't have any nutritional value
[1432.64 - 1436.44] and I will not exercise but I can take
[1434.40 - 1438.24] care of the mind it does not work other
[1436.44 - 1440.52] way around also I can eat the healthiest
[1438.24 - 1443.00] of foods I can exercise regularly but I
[1440.52 - 1444.76] will not take care of the Mind the body
[1443.00 - 1446.92] will collapse so whatever happens to the
[1444.76 - 1448.96] mind will happen will affect the body
[1446.92 - 1450.88] whatever you're doing to the body is
[1448.96 - 1453.88] going to impact the mind they're not
[1450.88 - 1456.12] separate it's one entity so it is so
[1453.88 - 1459.88] important for people to understand the
[1456.12 - 1462.92] human system as a whole and when they do
[1459.88 - 1465.88] that that is when they understand the
[1462.92 - 1467.76] value of like I do mind coaching and we
[1465.88 - 1470.36] begin with Clarity and then it goes to
[1467.76 - 1472.28] diet and ex exercise you have to clean
[1470.36 - 1475.00] up your eating your unay Kos is what is
[1472.28 - 1477.60] going to make you f uh finish what you
[1475.00 - 1479.24] started and I teach manifestation and
[1477.60 - 1481.92] diet and exercise is a part of
[1479.24 - 1484.64] manifestation training as well how do
[1481.92 - 1486.72] you have an alert mind in a diseased
[1484.64 - 1489.08] body it's not
[1486.72 - 1491.48] possible and there cannot be a healthy
[1489.08 - 1494.60] mind in a diseased body or the other way
[1491.48 - 1497.64] around either so seeing it as a whole is
[1494.60 - 1498.84] where you begin so again one very
[1497.64 - 1500.36] important
[1498.84 - 1502.96] uh thing which your listeners can
[1500.36 - 1506.00] benefit from is we always approach
[1502.96 - 1508.92] nutrition and exercise from aesthetic
[1506.00 - 1511.80] point of VI I think it has to become
[1508.92 - 1514.40] from the health perspective even more so
[1511.80 - 1516.28] and from manifesting your dreams how do
[1514.40 - 1518.20] you manifest a dream with a with a
[1516.28 - 1521.08] completely drained out human system
[1518.20 - 1524.08] doesn't work those are wise words so I
[1521.08 - 1526.28] remember meeting the SPG Commandos once
[1524.08 - 1529.84] and the colonel in charge over there
[1526.28 - 1532.28] says we develop go go muscles not show
[1529.84 - 1535.32] muscles I also believe that they
[1532.28 - 1538.80] developed go thinking not show thinking
[1535.32 - 1540.80] today's society is quite materialistic
[1538.80 - 1544.32] and shallow where we can dress ourselves
[1540.80 - 1546.04] up as being healthy as being powerful as
[1544.32 - 1549.36] being all
[1546.04 - 1552.00] present but I think yes we are all
[1549.36 - 1556.84] animals inside deep down but we got to
[1552.00 - 1558.92] polish it speaking of animals I know I I
[1556.84 - 1562.24] I know this this is one question that I
[1558.92 - 1566.88] had to ask you shaam you trained uh the
[1562.24 - 1569.60] film stars ranir Kapoor in that role and
[1566.88 - 1572.36] uh that was an amazing transformation to
[1569.60 - 1575.76] stand over there and see your shoulders
[1572.36 - 1579.44] and all the youngsters in India they
[1575.76 - 1581.56] look at that show Muscle tell us how
[1579.44 - 1584.36] difficult and how much of sweat maybe
[1581.56 - 1585.84] tears an effort that has to go on I know
[1584.36 - 1588.32] definitely there was willpower over
[1585.84 - 1590.84] there there was discipline but could you
[1588.32 - 1592.84] just tell us like how intense did it get
[1590.84 - 1595.12] when you had to prepare or was it a walk
[1592.84 - 1597.44] in the park no definitely not a walk in
[1595.12 - 1599.72] the park but uh you know when you guys
[1597.44 - 1602.12] are speaking about wipai and discipline
[1599.72 - 1604.04] those are two things which ranir is I
[1602.12 - 1607.24] think born with it's just conditioned
[1604.04 - 1609.36] into him his punctuality his discipline
[1607.24 - 1611.04] his whether we were shooting we're not
[1609.36 - 1613.68] shooting whether it's early morning it's
[1611.04 - 1616.52] after shoot it's on the set when he
[1613.68 - 1619.00] knows something needs to get done and he
[1616.52 - 1620.44] does it again whether it's 20 minutes 30
[1619.00 - 1621.84] minutes not a problem and I used to tell
[1620.44 - 1623.48] him I said it's okay you know if you
[1621.84 - 1625.24] don't have an hour to train that's fine
[1623.48 - 1627.76] let's just train for 30 minutes you know
[1625.24 - 1631.00] let's remove that much time cuz again
[1627.76 - 1633.44] exercise and progress and transformation
[1631.00 - 1635.40] is all like that compounding effect
[1633.44 - 1637.16] turning up turning up of course you have
[1635.40 - 1640.16] to turn up you have to turn up for it
[1637.16 - 1642.20] and the the more you keep doing it the
[1640.16 - 1644.44] better it keeps getting I mean it's easy
[1642.20 - 1646.20] to just say you know what uh we only
[1644.44 - 1647.60] have 30 minutes today so let's just
[1646.20 - 1650.24] let's just not worry we'll just do
[1647.60 - 1652.56] tomorrow it's easy and technically in in
[1650.24 - 1655.28] a day nothing's going to go wrong but
[1652.56 - 1658.40] being there for the even the 30 minutes
[1655.28 - 1660.72] it somewhere gives you um a victory a
[1658.40 - 1664.36] sense of Victory small wins so that is
[1660.72 - 1666.76] anyways there in his nature and um we
[1664.36 - 1668.96] started before his the the the movie
[1666.76 - 1671.92] that we started earlier was to juty mear
[1668.96 - 1674.56] where he had to be uh player romcom
[1671.92 - 1677.52] Beach Body Fresh looking like a very
[1674.56 - 1680.20] youngster kind of thing and we started
[1677.52 - 1681.96] working out before that so in that movie
[1680.20 - 1684.24] he was super ripped his abs and
[1681.96 - 1686.80] everything were like seen and all of
[1684.24 - 1688.84] that and when we started we were nowhere
[1686.80 - 1691.68] close to that so somewhere it had to
[1688.84 - 1693.56] start literally from Basics you know
[1691.68 - 1695.84] getting him to do the basic lifts the
[1693.56 - 1699.04] basic movements getting his form correct
[1695.84 - 1701.28] all of that the body shot was done
[1699.04 - 1704.20] literally I would say for that movie was
[1701.28 - 1706.56] done a year into the work so it was one
[1704.20 - 1710.12] year of work one year of work for that
[1706.56 - 1713.60] first movie cuz I I believe unless and
[1710.12 - 1716.52] until it is desperation and there's no
[1713.60 - 1719.56] choice it can be achieved in a smaller
[1716.52 - 1722.76] time frame but it's not the healthiest
[1719.56 - 1724.64] way to approach it cuz if you do then
[1722.76 - 1726.80] firstly the minute you go back to your
[1724.64 - 1729.12] normal routine the results are going to
[1726.80 - 1731.60] rebound I call that occupational side
[1729.12 - 1733.88] effect AB absolutely and people like you
[1731.60 - 1736.88] have to ensure that there's a health
[1733.88 - 1738.52] balancing Factor versus the the looks or
[1736.88 - 1740.08] the requirement of the road absolutely
[1738.52 - 1743.08] and we have to we have to understand
[1740.08 - 1745.56] that even for for all the actors health
[1743.08 - 1749.32] is very important because one day of not
[1745.56 - 1751.52] showing up on set is a lot of loss the
[1749.32 - 1753.68] entire industry for the crew for the
[1751.52 - 1755.60] producers whoever so we have to keep
[1753.68 - 1757.72] that in mind and if if that's something
[1755.60 - 1760.04] that we can control from our side then
[1757.72 - 1761.84] we try to do it the best so even
[1760.04 - 1763.72] training wise and everything we did it
[1761.84 - 1765.88] we did it properly with the good proper
[1763.72 - 1767.80] nutrition the proper you know like we
[1765.88 - 1770.92] spoke in the starts knowing at what
[1767.80 - 1773.20] point of the journey you need to do what
[1770.92 - 1774.92] kind of training so when we did CrossFit
[1773.20 - 1777.64] kind of training it was more towards the
[1774.92 - 1779.48] end when the dness and the definition
[1777.64 - 1781.24] was required initially it was just about
[1779.48 - 1783.48] building the muscle building the
[1781.24 - 1786.48] foundation and then from there we
[1783.48 - 1788.40] started working for animal and again the
[1786.48 - 1792.44] body that you see an animal during the
[1788.40 - 1794.32] fight sequence was again a year after so
[1792.44 - 1796.40] it's not that we started working and
[1794.32 - 1800.28] literally 3 months later he was the way
[1796.40 - 1802.00] he was so that also took time cuz during
[1800.28 - 1804.60] the entire shoot he's wearing suits he's
[1802.00 - 1806.56] wearing shirts his body is not shown so
[1804.60 - 1810.00] it's easy to kind of work behind the
[1806.56 - 1811.48] scenes and give us enough time because I
[1810.00 - 1814.04] explained this to him as well I said you
[1811.48 - 1816.56] know it's better if the more we can
[1814.04 - 1818.92] delay the body shot and keep it towards
[1816.56 - 1821.32] the end it will give us more time to
[1818.92 - 1823.60] kind of work to it properly and he
[1821.32 - 1825.32] understood that cuz once we reached
[1823.60 - 1827.32] there it was very easy for him now when
[1825.32 - 1830.20] he's shooting his current film Rama and
[1827.32 - 1831.68] I'm not training him for that film but
[1830.20 - 1833.36] even the way he's looking right now
[1831.68 - 1835.76] whoever he's training with his body has
[1833.36 - 1840.48] kind of adapted to that new Baseline
[1835.76 - 1843.36] it's not gone back to the 71 70 kg toar
[1840.48 - 1845.08] Kap it some way kind of retain that
[1843.36 - 1846.96] muscle and that muscle memory which is
[1845.08 - 1850.76] always a plus Point that's that that's
[1846.96 - 1852.40] how we need to see ourselves when we are
[1850.76 - 1853.80] looking at transforming or changing our
[1852.40 - 1856.44] bodies as well so there are two
[1853.80 - 1858.48] takeaways from this one I realized that
[1856.44 - 1860.76] the Transformations what people see in
[1858.48 - 1863.20] the movie which is a 1 hour one and a
[1860.76 - 1865.16] half sit down is actually sometimes as
[1863.20 - 1866.96] long as a year before you see the
[1865.16 - 1869.20] transformation so there's sweat and
[1866.96 - 1872.28] tears that go into that the discipline
[1869.20 - 1874.08] of turning up and showing up and uh the
[1872.28 - 1875.72] other part is that they're worried about
[1874.08 - 1877.56] their health also so they're not looking
[1875.72 - 1878.88] at shortcuts which most of the people
[1877.56 - 1880.96] out there think that these
[1878.88 - 1884.16] Transformations I can do it at the cost
[1880.96 - 1888.20] of my health um and speaking of the
[1884.16 - 1891.28] movie Animal we get these very ripped
[1888.20 - 1895.08] bodies with our actors in the male
[1891.28 - 1898.68] physique that movie had a different
[1895.08 - 1901.00] theme to it on the animal instincts in
[1898.68 - 1905.04] all of us but I wanted to take this
[1901.00 - 1906.32] question to vinda that the male audience
[1905.04 - 1909.16] whilst we
[1906.32 - 1913.00] pursuing this amazing physique maybe
[1909.16 - 1917.40] show Muscle there is a underlining
[1913.00 - 1921.08] thought on how weak or how powerful the
[1917.40 - 1923.84] man's mind can be towards family towards
[1921.08 - 1926.92] women towards Society in general so I've
[1923.84 - 1929.16] seen this when we have done uh diets for
[1926.92 - 1932.16] people who are athletes or
[1929.16 - 1934.20] Transformations there is an aggression
[1932.16 - 1937.16] uh because of the requirement to build
[1934.20 - 1940.16] the show muscles so from a mind coach
[1937.16 - 1942.08] point of view and you both married each
[1940.16 - 1946.16] other that's why I said you a perfect
[1942.08 - 1950.04] powerful couple how do you balance that
[1946.16 - 1952.40] I should I say testost Stone driven
[1950.04 - 1954.76] Rage which we're seeing in today's world
[1952.40 - 1957.48] in context of how women are treated in
[1954.76 - 1962.16] our country and is there something that
[1957.48 - 1965.00] the men can do to get the brain to a
[1962.16 - 1967.20] certain level of calmness so this is
[1965.00 - 1969.68] really important to address especially
[1967.20 - 1972.48] today Ryan
[1969.68 - 1975.00] because nothing became this way
[1972.48 - 1978.84] overnight nothing became this way
[1975.00 - 1982.12] overnight it has taken years of doing
[1978.84 - 1984.48] and a lot of it has to be undone so when
[1982.12 - 1987.68] we speak about an animalistic or very
[1984.48 - 1990.16] marcher way of uh treating the feminine
[1987.68 - 1992.00] in a not so respectful manner like this
[1990.16 - 1993.56] morning when I was doing my
[1992.00 - 1995.32] manifestation coaching in fact and we
[1993.56 - 1998.08] were manifesting relationships I was
[1995.32 - 1999.72] teaching people how to do that I was
[1998.08 - 2002.32] telling them that when and I have
[1999.72 - 2005.44] couples together in that as well so you
[2002.32 - 2008.44] need to may be very clear of what you
[2005.44 - 2011.48] want in life from your partner
[2008.44 - 2014.08] and how you wish to be even yourself as
[2011.48 - 2016.52] a human being so when we are saying
[2014.08 - 2018.72] everybody says I want to be driven I
[2016.52 - 2020.64] want to be a hustler I want to be this I
[2018.72 - 2023.08] said all right all of those are
[2020.64 - 2025.16] masculine qualities so every human being
[2023.08 - 2027.32] whether you're a male or a female you
[2025.16 - 2030.28] have masculine and feminine energies in
[2027.32 - 2032.04] your body as well so your right channel
[2030.28 - 2034.76] is called the suryan Nar which is the
[2032.04 - 2037.20] masculine and the left uh nostril which
[2034.76 - 2038.72] dominates a idadi which is the feminine
[2037.20 - 2042.08] which is lunar
[2038.72 - 2044.04] a balance of these two in fact is very
[2042.08 - 2046.28] important for the biochemistry of your
[2044.04 - 2048.64] body to be functioning fine if suryan
[2046.28 - 2051.16] Nadi is too active there's a lot of
[2048.64 - 2052.84] aggression you're you're going to have
[2051.16 - 2054.64] acidity you're going to have anger
[2052.84 - 2056.68] issues the angrier you are the angrier
[2054.64 - 2058.72] your energies are the more fiery your
[2056.68 - 2060.52] energies are you're going to have
[2058.72 - 2062.76] physical symptoms of the same
[2060.52 - 2065.00] indigestion is going to be one of them
[2062.76 - 2067.16] the other way if you're too lunar you
[2065.00 - 2070.16] you have Moon's energy surging too much
[2067.16 - 2073.76] you're too too too compassionate or too
[2070.16 - 2077.16] uh there's everything can be in excess
[2073.76 - 2079.84] which nature is not in favor of nature
[2077.16 - 2082.04] thrives in balance and why this is
[2079.84 - 2084.72] happening also Ryan is also because of
[2082.04 - 2086.72] what we are observing as kids so one
[2084.72 - 2088.64] thing when I'm talking to couples I do a
[2086.72 - 2091.12] lot of couple therapies as
[2088.64 - 2093.40] well when I say when I'm speaking to
[2091.12 - 2095.52] them I said first thing you stop is stop
[2093.40 - 2096.88] belittling your partner whether it's
[2095.52 - 2099.44] wife doing to the husband or husband
[2096.88 - 2101.36] doing to the wife stop making jokes on
[2099.44 - 2103.48] marriages that's a that's a wrong thing
[2101.36 - 2105.00] to do it's it's not it's something I'm
[2103.48 - 2106.52] guilty of so I make fun of my wife in
[2105.00 - 2108.28] front of my kids so that's something I
[2106.52 - 2110.60] should not be doing yes because it
[2108.28 - 2112.32] leaves an impression it leaves an
[2110.60 - 2114.40] impression it leaves an imprint on the
[2112.32 - 2117.60] child especially if the child is Young
[2114.40 - 2120.04] so you never ever you whatever you can
[2117.60 - 2123.20] have arguments but your child is not
[2120.04 - 2126.84] supposed to be witnessing those and even
[2123.20 - 2128.80] in your own mind the feminine like I
[2126.84 - 2132.44] keep telling the men specifically as
[2128.80 - 2134.88] well the they are energy wates the
[2132.44 - 2139.60] entire creation is feminine she's energy
[2134.88 - 2142.52] she's shy so even in our Hindu culture
[2139.60 - 2144.12] the feminine is deeply respected deeply
[2142.52 - 2146.56] deeply respected if you want to have
[2144.12 - 2148.48] prosperity in your life if you want lxmi
[2146.56 - 2151.24] in your life you respect your mother you
[2148.48 - 2154.84] respect your wife you respect every
[2151.24 - 2158.28] female whoever you end up working with
[2154.84 - 2160.28] so this is a practice that has to be
[2158.28 - 2162.92] firstly taught to children from a very
[2160.28 - 2165.56] young age only the masculine qualities
[2162.92 - 2168.60] are getting glorified you're an achiever
[2165.56 - 2170.96] you're a go-getter great but are you a
[2168.60 - 2173.72] nurtural are you compassionate are do
[2170.96 - 2175.40] you have empathy because they are not
[2173.72 - 2176.88] validated that much by Society
[2175.40 - 2179.40] especially when it comes to men they say
[2176.88 - 2181.92] men should not cry you can cry you can
[2179.40 - 2185.08] have emotions it's a balance of the two
[2181.92 - 2186.56] so see me during a emotional movie he
[2185.08 - 2188.72] cries sometimes even more than me and
[2186.56 - 2191.16] that's very precious part of him and you
[2188.72 - 2193.40] will notice this Ryan between a couple
[2191.16 - 2195.72] you will see a beautiful dance of Shiva
[2193.40 - 2197.72] Shakti Shiva is the masculine shaki is
[2195.72 - 2200.64] the feminine emotions that you have so
[2197.72 - 2202.80] when one is feeling more feminine the
[2200.64 - 2204.80] other one gets more masculine the one
[2202.80 - 2207.00] other one stands up no no we can get
[2204.80 - 2210.28] over this we can do this irrespective of
[2207.00 - 2212.76] which gender they are from so everything
[2210.28 - 2214.36] is a play of energies and it is
[2212.76 - 2217.00] conditioning which is happening over
[2214.36 - 2218.96] time we are just glorifying the
[2217.00 - 2222.20] masculine the testosterone estrogen has
[2218.96 - 2225.56] a beautiful purpose but just um making
[2222.20 - 2227.68] it very concise that the conditioning
[2225.56 - 2229.84] the teaching what are we passing on to
[2227.68 - 2230.80] our children what children are observing
[2229.84 - 2234.20] in their
[2230.80 - 2236.72] homes every couple has to have respect
[2234.20 - 2240.92] between each other talk to each other as
[2236.72 - 2242.44] if you are your best friends and we act
[2240.92 - 2243.92] we actually bow down to each other so
[2242.44 - 2246.08] when we started doing our podcast we
[2243.92 - 2249.00] recently started doing our podcast we
[2246.08 - 2251.52] are very late on YouTube but here we are
[2249.00 - 2253.16] and uh the person who is doing our edits
[2251.52 - 2255.24] so she was who's handling our YouTube
[2253.16 - 2257.16] she's like why are you talking to each
[2255.24 - 2259.20] other like up so be normal how you are
[2257.16 - 2260.96] in the house I said this is how we speak
[2259.20 - 2264.04] to each other we speak to each other as
[2260.96 - 2267.76] up we don't say we've never said to or
[2264.04 - 2270.12] tum or no we treat each other with a lot
[2267.76 - 2271.92] of respect and people notice that on the
[2270.12 - 2274.72] podcast like how beautifully Shivam
[2271.92 - 2278.20] speaks to you so this is something that
[2274.72 - 2282.00] has to be learned otherwise
[2278.20 - 2284.56] the Dynamics of creation goes off and
[2282.00 - 2287.68] that is not conducive for creation to
[2284.56 - 2290.24] move forward so please everyone treat
[2287.68 - 2292.92] your life partners with absolute respect
[2290.24 - 2295.84] not just your life Partners or just your
[2292.92 - 2299.84] uh women in your house every woman is
[2295.84 - 2301.80] worth reverence please have respect and
[2299.84 - 2304.76] this has to be every human being has to
[2301.80 - 2308.28] be trained and for me it is like such a
[2304.76 - 2310.88] no-brainer like why would you not
[2308.28 - 2313.92] because I was raised that way I also I
[2310.88 - 2316.68] mean this could be controversial but um
[2313.92 - 2317.52] I grew up in a house where mother was
[2316.68 - 2322.16] very
[2317.52 - 2323.84] powerful she was a leader and uh she
[2322.16 - 2326.64] used to flick me on the back of my head
[2323.84 - 2327.44] and say open the door for a lady talk
[2326.64 - 2330.32] with
[2327.44 - 2332.80] respect controversial in this sense I
[2330.32 - 2336.00] believe the mothers of India also need
[2332.80 - 2338.56] to take a stance and correct their boys
[2336.00 - 2341.24] and that's what India's mother s are not
[2338.56 - 2345.40] doing to the Boy Child and hence they
[2341.24 - 2347.96] get away with behavior that does not
[2345.40 - 2350.32] give respect to the female so I think I
[2347.96 - 2351.08] would call out India and mothers out
[2350.32 - 2353.64] there and I know I'm going to get
[2351.08 - 2356.28] trolled for this but I I think the
[2353.64 - 2358.28] mothers also need to catch the boys by
[2356.28 - 2359.64] the caller before they're 18 always tell
[2358.28 - 2361.68] them you know it's your God given right
[2359.64 - 2365.12] to to discipline your children the
[2361.68 - 2368.08] Fathers as well Fathers as well so when
[2365.12 - 2369.32] I'm training I train uh couples who
[2368.08 - 2371.12] carrying a baby so I never say the
[2369.32 - 2373.12] mother's carrying the baby the couple
[2371.12 - 2375.48] gets pregnant the couple carries the
[2373.12 - 2376.96] baby fullterm so when I'm doing
[2375.48 - 2379.08] practices the practices are not only for
[2376.96 - 2381.88] the mother the practices are for the
[2379.08 - 2384.28] husband and the wife and I guess that's
[2381.88 - 2387.48] why you have that philosophy as both as
[2384.28 - 2389.28] a couple that we respect each other so
[2387.48 - 2391.88] it's not about the mother giving birth
[2389.28 - 2393.80] and it's my baby my body but it's like
[2391.88 - 2395.96] it's a whole Fusion of you together as a
[2393.80 - 2397.96] unit and there's no competition there is
[2395.96 - 2399.88] no male versus female there is no
[2397.96 - 2402.80] competing who Superior you know that has
[2399.88 - 2406.20] changed for me in my life about the day
[2402.80 - 2407.88] my son was born um I remember I called
[2406.20 - 2410.24] on my dad and I said I've become a dad
[2407.88 - 2414.40] and my voice had actually broken and he
[2410.24 - 2418.00] says welcome to fatherhood you are now
[2414.40 - 2421.20] no longer in competition with your
[2418.00 - 2424.48] wife and and and and I it it sunk in you
[2421.20 - 2427.92] know that um uh you can't compete with
[2424.48 - 2430.04] your spouse you shouldn't be doing that
[2427.92 - 2433.44] uh and for me that was
[2430.04 - 2434.92] lifechanging uh that okay it's difficult
[2433.44 - 2436.44] you know when you lead companies you
[2434.92 - 2439.00] lead people you want to lead in the
[2436.44 - 2440.24] marriage also so sometimes when we have
[2439.00 - 2441.16] conversations these days she like what
[2440.24 - 2442.72] do you want to do I was like okay
[2441.16 - 2444.52] whatever do you want to do that's
[2442.72 - 2446.00] beautiful and and the idea over there
[2444.52 - 2448.12] was earlier was like no no I have to
[2446.00 - 2450.20] decide what I want to do but now it's
[2448.12 - 2451.60] kind of like okay let's where do we go
[2450.20 - 2454.16] what do you want to do and stuff like
[2451.60 - 2455.48] that and even in spaces where okay this
[2454.16 - 2458.24] is something you said about what do you
[2455.48 - 2460.44] want to do but even in uh major
[2458.24 - 2462.32] decisions if you're business partners
[2460.44 - 2465.08] like we are business partners and when
[2462.32 - 2466.60] you're having a discussion so I always
[2465.08 - 2468.64] even when I'm doing couples counseling I
[2466.60 - 2471.56] give this example that doesn't have to
[2468.64 - 2474.44] be your way or my way there would be a
[2471.56 - 2477.04] right way irrespective of who's giving
[2474.44 - 2479.04] that suggestion so having that mindset
[2477.04 - 2480.76] or having that perspective that you can
[2479.04 - 2483.36] see a situation in
[2480.76 - 2484.80] totality and see one point of view see
[2483.36 - 2486.96] another point of view and both of them
[2484.80 - 2489.24] can see oh no this makes more sense so
[2486.96 - 2491.44] let it let's do it this way she's always
[2489.24 - 2493.36] right so I just like just we're doing
[2491.44 - 2495.16] exactly what you saying because I've
[2493.36 - 2497.16] fallen on my face so many times after
[2495.16 - 2498.40] not listening to her that I said you
[2497.16 - 2500.92] know what it is there in the astrology
[2498.40 - 2505.20] chart though I said that I I want to
[2500.92 - 2507.24] lead a frictionless life which
[2505.20 - 2509.28] means it's not like there should not be
[2507.24 - 2511.36] any discomfort I I don't want to force
[2509.28 - 2513.44] any friction I want to kind of go with
[2511.36 - 2515.64] the flow I want to be happy and I know
[2513.44 - 2518.24] that whatever she's saying I I tell her
[2515.64 - 2520.96] I said I know you're right five minutes
[2518.24 - 2523.64] let me argue with you for the sake of
[2520.96 - 2524.68] just that ego that the feeling good
[2523.64 - 2526.20] because I know that whatever you're
[2524.68 - 2528.28] saying we're going to do that only but
[2526.20 - 2531.68] five minutes just to satisfy my own
[2528.28 - 2533.24] little male little ego little L aete
[2531.68 - 2535.20] inside of you let me just let me just
[2533.24 - 2537.40] argue for five minutes you just for the
[2535.20 - 2538.68] just for the heck of it because she
[2537.40 - 2542.76] literally
[2538.68 - 2547.20] has intuition and she literally has um a
[2542.76 - 2548.72] vision that can see 10 steps ahead and
[2547.20 - 2551.00] when you've seen that and it's been
[2548.72 - 2552.24] proven then why are you going to fight
[2551.00 - 2555.16] against
[2552.24 - 2557.12] it just go with it no it's it's as
[2555.16 - 2560.52] simple as that so when you know that
[2557.12 - 2564.44] someone is right it's it's easier to
[2560.52 - 2566.60] leave your ego behind and just kind of
[2564.44 - 2570.32] let it happen cuz she's anyways going to
[2566.60 - 2572.44] make it right so just sit back enjoy I
[2570.32 - 2574.68] think most of us men do that you know
[2572.44 - 2576.72] it's like the other day she's like uh
[2574.68 - 2578.16] okay um where do you want to go for a
[2576.72 - 2579.92] holiday it's like wherever you want to
[2578.16 - 2581.36] go for the holidays like how can you not
[2579.92 - 2583.20] decide where you want to go for theid I
[2581.36 - 2584.56] was like you know first you kind of
[2583.20 - 2585.88] populate the list of where you want to
[2584.56 - 2588.24] go and I'm like like yeah we we'll
[2585.88 - 2591.48] figure that out where we're going to go
[2588.24 - 2594.92] but this frictionless process uh is also
[2591.48 - 2597.36] I think Shivam part of evolvement of
[2594.92 - 2599.80] every individual so we evolve in our
[2597.36 - 2604.80] mind we evolve in our bodies we evolve
[2599.80 - 2607.48] in age your journey um from athlete to
[2604.80 - 2610.64] fitness trainer to now lead leading
[2607.48 - 2614.24] people and guiding them has your time in
[2610.64 - 2616.16] the gym begun to change both personally
[2614.24 - 2618.72] and do you now begin to subscribe that
[2616.16 - 2621.68] to people that you coach also do you see
[2618.72 - 2625.12] where they are in their life I I think
[2621.68 - 2628.32] 100% my time in the gym has has changed
[2625.12 - 2629.96] a lot I mean from right now literally
[2628.32 - 2631.92] it's because with everything else going
[2629.96 - 2634.80] on I know that I have those two hours
[2631.92 - 2636.60] only to train so when I enter the gym
[2634.80 - 2638.96] it's literally those two hours they're
[2636.60 - 2640.56] my time time and in that time I don't
[2638.96 - 2642.60] want to answer any calls I don't want to
[2640.56 - 2646.08] speak to anybody so I literally in my
[2642.60 - 2649.04] gym come across as the most arrogant and
[2646.08 - 2650.80] most strict and Caro person in the gym
[2649.04 - 2653.40] is it because you're on your own space
[2650.80 - 2656.12] yeah so I like to put that I'm I'm not
[2653.40 - 2658.88] putting it out purposely but it's like
[2656.12 - 2659.92] when you're focusing on something even
[2658.88 - 2661.44] though you're staring at something
[2659.92 - 2663.56] you're not staring at it so it's like
[2661.44 - 2666.80] there there's no expression it's blank
[2663.56 - 2670.00] so people kind of you know think that oh
[2666.80 - 2671.92] it's arrogance but it's it's absolutely
[2670.00 - 2673.32] fine but then of course two three people
[2671.92 - 2675.44] came and spoke to me or they asked me
[2673.32 - 2677.72] something about Fitness and they say
[2675.44 - 2680.64] you're actually not as Karo as you look
[2677.72 - 2683.60] you're actually quite sweet I said yeah
[2680.64 - 2685.00] because I'm in my space so I like to I
[2683.60 - 2688.44] don't wear headphones I don't wear a
[2685.00 - 2691.12] t-shirt that says buzz off I think my
[2688.44 - 2697.20] energy is enough to tell
[2691.12 - 2700.24] people lak re M but it's fine and I try
[2697.20 - 2702.44] to tell people when I people who I know
[2700.24 - 2704.56] and in the gym I've complained also okay
[2702.44 - 2706.56] what the hell's going on this is a gym
[2704.56 - 2708.76] not I mean why are you talking so loudly
[2706.56 - 2710.32] talk but don't let other and people know
[2708.76 - 2712.64] me as that complaint box whatever and
[2710.32 - 2715.44] it's fine but people who I know I tell
[2712.64 - 2717.72] them I said you work so hard you spend
[2715.44 - 2720.40] so much time and effort in
[2717.72 - 2723.80] training why are you I mean you can do
[2720.40 - 2726.76] the same conversation outside outside in
[2723.80 - 2728.16] a different time why are you wasting
[2726.76 - 2729.56] your time because now you're saying
[2728.16 - 2730.88] you've got to go pick up your son from
[2729.56 - 2732.32] school or you got to go buy some
[2730.88 - 2734.92] groceries or you got to do some other
[2732.32 - 2736.60] work so this time is a very limited
[2734.92 - 2738.32] amount of time that you have in the gym
[2736.60 - 2741.32] which you actually love and you look
[2738.32 - 2743.20] forward to then you're contradicting It
[2741.32 - 2746.40] Yourself by coming
[2743.20 - 2748.32] and okay meet and greet is fine but stop
[2746.40 - 2750.12] it at that no I want to throw a little
[2748.32 - 2751.92] bit of controversy into this so far
[2750.12 - 2754.88] right now because she said she was a
[2751.92 - 2757.52] fitness trainer too and I see women in
[2754.88 - 2758.88] the gym having the most amazing workouts
[2757.52 - 2761.56] because they're talking and talking and
[2758.88 - 2763.08] talking and talking so what's your take
[2761.56 - 2767.36] on on his thought he's the one who
[2763.08 - 2772.12] changed my uh perspective yeah so for me
[2767.36 - 2774.44] um whatever you do in life you have to
[2772.12 - 2776.16] Horn into you have to literally focus
[2774.44 - 2779.88] into it whether it's training whether
[2776.16 - 2782.12] it's eating whether it's drinking it it
[2779.88 - 2784.56] deserves all of your attention because
[2782.12 - 2786.32] it is going to become your life force so
[2784.56 - 2789.16] this happened in fact in the gym and
[2786.32 - 2791.32] this really noisy gym web where I'm
[2789.16 - 2794.64] sorry to say but it's not just limited
[2791.32 - 2797.52] to women men and women my God you talk
[2794.64 - 2799.72] across uh workstations they can talk
[2797.52 - 2802.32] across cardio equipments and I'm in the
[2799.72 - 2804.16] middle and I'm like excuse me can you
[2802.32 - 2806.44] please get up from here and I'll shift
[2804.16 - 2808.32] I'll go to that side you can chat I
[2806.44 - 2810.12] don't know how you're breathing while
[2808.32 - 2813.36] you're exercising and you're talking I
[2810.12 - 2816.00] don't know how that works so understand
[2813.36 - 2818.24] and I said this to uh he said this to
[2816.00 - 2820.72] somebody he said you need to have some
[2818.24 - 2822.60] discipline in the gym and they got very
[2820.72 - 2824.12] offended they said what do you mean
[2822.60 - 2827.68] discipline this not a
[2824.12 - 2831.04] school and I my jaw dropped I like we
[2827.68 - 2832.64] never understood what discipline was
[2831.04 - 2835.32] discipline was not only for studying it
[2832.64 - 2838.44] was supposed to be carried forward to
[2835.32 - 2841.68] see anything to fruition to do justice
[2838.44 - 2843.96] to anything in life you need to have
[2841.68 - 2845.52] discipline and discipline is very boring
[2843.96 - 2847.44] it's not very interesting it is not like
[2845.52 - 2849.00] when exerting will when the fitness
[2847.44 - 2850.96] journey is starting and you're exerting
[2849.00 - 2853.60] will and people are complimenting you
[2850.96 - 2855.92] and it's novelty I think that's why we
[2853.60 - 2858.72] need a fitness coach or we need a mind
[2855.92 - 2860.44] coach and specifically as a mind coach
[2858.72 - 2862.12] because like Fitness coach is becoming a
[2860.44 - 2864.40] trend now right I have a personal
[2862.12 - 2866.64] trainer I have a yoga instructor and
[2864.40 - 2869.12] people are realizing that uh it does
[2866.64 - 2871.16] work but from a mind coach point of view
[2869.12 - 2873.28] when somebody says uh this is not school
[2871.16 - 2875.60] and we don't need to be disciplined I
[2873.28 - 2877.64] think and that's what I communicate to
[2875.60 - 2879.68] everyone about diet
[2877.64 - 2881.88] the last time you were held
[2879.68 - 2885.84] accountable was by your school teacher
[2881.88 - 2887.56] and principal so true so true and that's
[2885.84 - 2890.52] why I tell people I love these Health
[2887.56 - 2892.04] checkups which have a b c d in it
[2890.52 - 2894.92] because then when you have bone health
[2892.04 - 2897.04] at D and you have cholesterol at C then
[2894.92 - 2898.28] you're kind of getting a disciplined
[2897.04 - 2899.92] card saying that you need to do
[2898.28 - 2902.48] something about your life but do you
[2899.92 - 2905.28] know how sad it is that you cannot hold
[2902.48 - 2909.28] yourself accountable and your entire
[2905.28 - 2911.40] life somebody else has to come and like
[2909.28 - 2914.48] push you in that direction it's fine
[2911.40 - 2917.16] till a certain uh stage in your life but
[2914.48 - 2920.64] when you're are an adult you need to
[2917.16 - 2922.28] develop a mindset which says if this is
[2920.64 - 2923.76] good for me I've decided something is
[2922.28 - 2925.48] good for me whether it's working out
[2923.76 - 2927.52] whether it's eating healthy whether it's
[2925.48 - 2929.84] sleeping on time following circadian
[2927.52 - 2932.96] rhythms it's important for me it's good
[2929.84 - 2935.68] for me I am going to do it you don't see
[2932.96 - 2939.28] in terms of easy or hard so in terms of
[2935.68 - 2940.84] easy or hard is there any quick tips
[2939.28 - 2944.24] that you can give the
[2940.84 - 2946.32] viewers just to get more healthier
[2944.24 - 2949.20] because I would say I need you to have
[2946.32 - 2952.52] an amla in the morning Shivam will say
[2949.20 - 2954.60] do four sets of this exercise and follow
[2952.52 - 2957.44] it up with XY Z
[2954.60 - 2959.80] stretching I'm just trying to grasp like
[2957.44 - 2961.84] what do you tell the mind oh thank you
[2959.80 - 2963.60] for asking this question because when
[2961.84 - 2965.92] you speak about the mind I'm mentioning
[2963.60 - 2969.08] mind multiple times but where is the
[2965.92 - 2971.92] mind and there's a very very beautiful
[2969.08 - 2974.84] line by the senior cardiologist Dr BM
[2971.92 - 2977.36] hegre and he says where is the mind
[2974.84 - 2979.84] never mind so we only know we only aware
[2977.36 - 2981.88] of the brain brain yes mind is all over
[2979.84 - 2984.20] the body every cell of your body is
[2981.88 - 2987.72] perceiving something so that is what
[2984.20 - 2991.60] science is also trying to uh come to is
[2987.72 - 2994.12] mind is kind of like a wag concept and
[2991.60 - 2997.60] it is non-local that's what the yogic
[2994.12 - 2999.72] system also believes and the only way to
[2997.60 - 3001.48] grasp the mind or to bring about changes
[2999.72 - 3004.00] in the mind is through the breath so in
[3001.48 - 3005.92] the yogic scriptures there's a beautiful
[3004.00 - 3008.68] uh verse which
[3005.92 - 3010.92] says as the breath moves the mind will
[3008.68 - 3013.16] move so the step one the most
[3010.92 - 3016.72] fundamental thing that your viewers can
[3013.16 - 3018.20] do is learn how to breathe right EV a
[3016.72 - 3019.52] lot of people I won't say everybody
[3018.20 - 3021.36] because a lot of them would be breathing
[3019.52 - 3023.12] right but most of the people are very
[3021.36 - 3025.68] shallow breathers and they can be mouth
[3023.12 - 3027.84] breathers and the biggest reason for the
[3025.68 - 3030.92] elevated levels of of Stress and Anxiety
[3027.84 - 3033.44] is also because we don't know how to
[3030.92 - 3035.76] decompress what's decompress decompress
[3033.44 - 3037.08] literally means this carbon dioxide
[3035.76 - 3039.24] building up in your system and you're
[3037.08 - 3041.60] not even exhaling properly so what else
[3039.24 - 3044.52] is going to happen build up of stress
[3041.60 - 3047.16] your body will exper part of it is
[3044.52 - 3050.28] carbon dioxide let go of the carbon
[3047.16 - 3052.12] dioxide so when you are just get little
[3050.28 - 3055.28] mindful about the bra way that you
[3052.12 - 3058.36] breathe you keep your spine upright
[3055.28 - 3061.36] inhale always through the the
[3058.36 - 3063.64] nose consciously involve the diaphragm
[3061.36 - 3066.32] it's a beautiful muscle its function is
[3063.64 - 3068.16] in respiration involving the diaphragm
[3066.32 - 3069.76] what does it look like the abdomen will
[3068.16 - 3073.36] come out
[3069.76 - 3073.36] slightly and as you
[3073.68 - 3079.40] exhale the abdomen will go in exhale
[3076.96 - 3081.68] longer than the inhalation if you're
[3079.40 - 3083.68] trying to de-stress so when you
[3081.68 - 3085.52] deliberately exhale say for 6 seconds
[3083.68 - 3087.80] you're inhaling to three from the nose
[3085.52 - 3089.44] exhale from the mouth or the nose for 6
[3087.80 - 3091.16] seconds you will see your
[3089.44 - 3094.40] parasympathetic nervous system kicking
[3091.16 - 3098.12] in you'll get calmer you'll feel more
[3094.40 - 3100.04] relaxed that's why people sigh yes it
[3098.12 - 3101.96] this is called a physiological sigh as
[3100.04 - 3105.76] well in which there is a double
[3101.96 - 3107.48] inhale and a exhale the science of
[3105.76 - 3109.80] breath is phenomenal the science of
[3107.48 - 3111.88] pranayams is phenomenal we are just
[3109.80 - 3113.76] talking about basic breath we've not
[3111.88 - 3117.08] even gone to the pranayams the system of
[3113.76 - 3119.76] pranayams so the entire yoga sutras if
[3117.08 - 3123.28] you say yog which is by Mahari patanjali
[3119.76 - 3126.04] it is all about managing the mind so I'm
[3123.28 - 3128.16] taking a cut over here from the mind in
[3126.04 - 3130.48] terms of you're saying there's the
[3128.16 - 3134.32] there's the mind and then you're saying
[3130.48 - 3137.40] there's the breath yeah so the breath if
[3134.32 - 3139.84] controlled is what keeps the mind in
[3137.40 - 3142.04] equilibrium and in control yes so in
[3139.84 - 3144.28] today's day and age when we don't have
[3142.04 - 3147.72] discipline or willpower one of the
[3144.28 - 3150.40] starting points could be breath
[3147.72 - 3152.16] erratic or Haywire am am I hearing you
[3150.40 - 3153.24] correct for sure because you can't have
[3152.16 - 3155.36] a strong
[3153.24 - 3157.80] willpower if you had a poor night's
[3155.36 - 3160.12] sleep mhm correct this is because if
[3157.80 - 3162.72] there is the pran is not moving fine in
[3160.12 - 3165.08] the body in the beginning I mentioned
[3162.72 - 3167.12] the subtle body of pran she the
[3165.08 - 3169.84] circulation why do we need to exercise
[3167.12 - 3172.72] even physically the bran gets circulated
[3169.84 - 3174.88] in the athletes rinda the exact same
[3172.72 - 3176.72] point they don't sleep well the previous
[3174.88 - 3179.00] night the resting heart rate next
[3176.72 - 3180.80] morning is high and the body actually
[3179.00 - 3182.64] requires more sugar to pump the heart
[3180.80 - 3183.96] faster which leads to more Cravings of
[3182.64 - 3186.88] the next day which means your diet goes
[3183.96 - 3188.32] for a toss exactly so and people say oh
[3186.88 - 3191.40] everything that sleep is an industry
[3188.32 - 3194.00] today like to get sleep see you will you
[3191.40 - 3196.88] again you are compartmentalizing the
[3194.00 - 3198.96] human being the sleep is not a thing by
[3196.88 - 3201.32] itself it is a culmination of what you
[3198.96 - 3203.12] did for the 24 hours so you can't be
[3201.32 - 3205.36] stressed throughout the day consuming
[3203.12 - 3207.48] content which is stressful not knowing
[3205.36 - 3208.76] how to breathe and you expect to fall
[3207.48 - 3210.96] asleep just the moment you switch off
[3208.76 - 3213.28] your lights that is not how it works
[3210.96 - 3216.00] your circadian clock has to be set in
[3213.28 - 3217.56] motion you can't be sleeping till 10:00
[3216.00 - 3220.04] in the morning and expect to fall asleep
[3217.56 - 3223.72] at 10 p.m. it will not happen speaking
[3220.04 - 3227.04] of sleep Shivam um we know that muscles
[3223.72 - 3230.52] are also built in the bedroom in terms
[3227.04 - 3232.28] of sleep the celebrities I've had many
[3230.52 - 3234.24] celebrity schedules and sometimes they
[3232.28 - 3236.12] shoot the whole night if you were to
[3234.24 - 3237.96] give the youngsters of this country and
[3236.12 - 3241.24] I'm talking talking about the 15 year
[3237.96 - 3242.76] olds to the 35 year olds advice and
[3241.24 - 3245.28] they're not going for a film shoot at
[3242.76 - 3247.48] night but they're distracted by say
[3245.28 - 3249.24] Netflix or TV or they think that they
[3247.48 - 3253.68] can get by with four or five hours of
[3249.24 - 3255.88] sleep what is your take on training and
[3253.68 - 3258.16] sleep see I think everything needs to
[3255.88 - 3261.40] change uh the whole definition of
[3258.16 - 3263.32] Fitness has changed for me as well now
[3261.40 - 3265.56] when I ask when I do webinars and I ask
[3263.32 - 3267.04] people I said what is your goal when it
[3265.56 - 3269.44] comes to Fitness
[3267.04 - 3271.56] and people reply all sorts of different
[3269.44 - 3275.64] things I think from my perspective it is
[3271.56 - 3278.88] to grow old in a healthy way repeat that
[3275.64 - 3281.40] again grow old in a healthy way so when
[3278.88 - 3284.12] I say that what do I mean when I'm okay
[3281.40 - 3286.12] right now right now everything is in our
[3284.12 - 3287.60] favor we're strong we're able to recover
[3286.12 - 3289.08] from our injuries better we don't need
[3287.60 - 3290.72] that many medicines we don't need to go
[3289.08 - 3294.40] see the doctor the physio all of that we
[3290.72 - 3299.08] can lift heavy all of that is great but
[3294.40 - 3302.84] today I'm 40 tomorrow 75 80 I don't want
[3299.08 - 3304.16] to be Dependable upon anything or anyone
[3302.84 - 3307.64] and for
[3304.16 - 3310.24] that that reward or that result will
[3307.64 - 3314.00] only be reached if I start working on it
[3310.24 - 3316.04] today so the sooner you begin it's it's
[3314.00 - 3319.84] not that if you you can't start training
[3316.04 - 3321.92] at 65 or 70 you can but the benefits
[3319.84 - 3323.40] that you will see if you start changing
[3321.92 - 3326.40] your lifestyle
[3323.40 - 3328.32] sooner is better no so when people are
[3326.40 - 3329.68] saying okay I'm only 15 I'm only 16 I
[3328.32 - 3332.96] mean come on we all have been there I
[3329.68 - 3335.32] mean till 13 14 years back I was parting
[3332.96 - 3337.68] four nights in a in a week and drinking
[3335.32 - 3339.60] and smoking and doing all of that but I
[3337.68 - 3341.72] was still exercising but again the body
[3339.60 - 3345.08] kind of supported
[3341.72 - 3346.96] that probably today the way children are
[3345.08 - 3349.16] or today the way the youth is it
[3346.96 - 3351.72] probably won't support anymore things
[3349.16 - 3354.76] have changed nutrition has changed a lot
[3351.72 - 3356.80] so somewhere we need to compensate all
[3354.76 - 3358.72] those actions as well so
[3356.80 - 3361.00] looking after uh you know managing
[3358.72 - 3363.68] stress doing certain breath work
[3361.00 - 3365.52] definitely focusing on exercise focusing
[3363.68 - 3367.40] on the right supplementation which we
[3365.52 - 3369.60] can probably of course supplements
[3367.40 - 3371.80] people think are bad but now when we
[3369.60 - 3373.88] have to compromise for the lack of
[3371.80 - 3376.72] nutrients from foods and supplements are
[3373.88 - 3379.00] absolutely okay so we have to do all
[3376.72 - 3381.28] that because once again youngsters need
[3379.00 - 3384.76] to understand they are literally
[3381.28 - 3387.36] investing today in themselves for a
[3384.76 - 3389.48] future tomorrow no one is saying go to
[3387.36 - 3391.88] the gym for 2 hours 3 hours get on a
[3389.48 - 3394.56] ketogenic diet and all of that but
[3391.88 - 3396.24] somewhere okay go party go drink your
[3394.56 - 3398.56] your kids I mean you are going to do it
[3396.24 - 3400.08] even if I tell you or your parents tell
[3398.56 - 3401.44] you not to do it you will do it and I've
[3400.08 - 3405.96] have done it so I'm nobody to tell you
[3401.44 - 3407.84] not to do it but at least balance it out
[3405.96 - 3409.44] somewhere that's the problem that
[3407.84 - 3411.68] balance is not happening
[3409.44 - 3413.80] anywhere even if they're not parting the
[3411.68 - 3416.48] sleeping late even if they're parting
[3413.80 - 3418.68] the eating wrong they're not training
[3416.48 - 3420.88] there definitely there's no uh Stress
[3418.68 - 3423.84] Management so there's nothing which is
[3420.88 - 3425.44] going in their favor besides the Natural
[3423.84 - 3427.12] Evolution of energy within their body
[3425.44 - 3429.44] which is helping them to get up every
[3427.12 - 3431.84] single morning do what needs to be done
[3429.44 - 3434.60] and continue but how long will that
[3431.84 - 3436.64] natural help that assistance be there
[3434.60 - 3441.04] how long at some point we will have to
[3436.64 - 3443.88] take over and do something ourselves
[3441.04 - 3446.20] otherwise it's all going to go downhill
[3443.88 - 3448.72] so as I said earlier most powerful
[3446.20 - 3453.20] couple I've ever met why because you're
[3448.72 - 3456.88] combining the mind and the body so when
[3453.20 - 3458.52] somebody coaches with both of you what's
[3456.88 - 3460.60] the takeaway or where are you
[3458.52 - 3462.80] approaching it from what's the power to
[3460.60 - 3465.28] make somebody more powerful is it that
[3462.80 - 3467.12] okay I let me do muscle for one year
[3465.28 - 3469.20] then I come and do mind for the next
[3467.12 - 3471.80] year or why the combination to start
[3469.20 - 3474.48] first off because like I mentioned
[3471.80 - 3477.08] earlier every human being needs to
[3474.48 - 3479.04] understand themselves in totality
[3477.08 - 3481.88] just your physical body is not who you
[3479.04 - 3485.12] are you have a mental emotional body and
[3481.88 - 3486.80] they affect each other so if I ask you
[3485.12 - 3489.92] if you have excessive cortisol in the
[3486.80 - 3493.16] body do you lose fat very easily you
[3489.92 - 3496.00] don't so some way your state of mind is
[3493.16 - 3498.48] even is connected to your physical
[3496.00 - 3499.84] fitness goals and not just that Ryan
[3498.48 - 3502.20] because I know you believe in law of
[3499.84 - 3504.48] attraction and manifestation and that is
[3502.20 - 3506.44] what I teach when you're trying to
[3504.48 - 3508.96] manifest something whether it's a a Fit
[3506.44 - 3510.72] Body whether it is a successful career
[3508.96 - 3514.12] happy relationship good health whatever
[3510.72 - 3516.32] it is you need a vibrant human system
[3514.12 - 3518.80] I'm not saying you need just muscles you
[3516.32 - 3521.16] need the human system to be vibrant you
[3518.80 - 3524.08] mentioned the vibrational frequencies so
[3521.16 - 3526.88] your system should be powerful and it
[3524.08 - 3528.76] has to have a certain positive frequency
[3526.88 - 3531.64] you can't be stressed from morning till
[3528.76 - 3534.64] night always focusing on lack what is
[3531.64 - 3536.28] not going right and expect to meet any
[3534.64 - 3539.44] goal whether it's physical fitness or
[3536.28 - 3541.40] otherwise it will not happen to the most
[3539.44 - 3545.36] in the most efficient manner it will not
[3541.40 - 3548.08] happen so just get clear people need to
[3545.36 - 3550.96] get clear of who they are in totality
[3548.08 - 3553.00] what are the uh Powers available to them
[3550.96 - 3555.28] what are the provisions given to them
[3553.00 - 3557.48] and all of them can be used to ACH
[3555.28 - 3560.20] attain whichever goal you decide to
[3557.48 - 3562.72] achieve whatever it is physical fitness
[3560.20 - 3565.16] so when we are taking on a client it has
[3562.72 - 3567.80] to be body and mind otherwise we are not
[3565.16 - 3570.52] doing Justice to the client you need to
[3567.80 - 3572.52] educate the client as well and everybody
[3570.52 - 3574.48] even shivom will say the same whenever
[3572.52 - 3576.84] he is having the first meeting with the
[3574.48 - 3579.16] client everybody is complaining of
[3576.84 - 3581.52] stress excessive stress whether it's
[3579.16 - 3583.28] corporates whether it is celebrities not
[3581.52 - 3584.68] just limited to them when we are
[3583.28 - 3587.16] coaching younger
[3584.68 - 3590.48] kids a 10 year-olds are experiencing
[3587.16 - 3593.48] stress excessive amounts of stress so
[3590.48 - 3595.20] not knowing how to handle your mind Ryan
[3593.48 - 3598.16] think about this we spoke about
[3595.20 - 3600.20] willpower discipline nobody's taught us
[3598.16 - 3602.20] actually how to develop those they just
[3600.20 - 3604.96] by default in the education system we
[3602.20 - 3607.00] pick it up nobody taught us how to focus
[3604.96 - 3609.92] how many times you heard as a kid focus
[3607.00 - 3612.60] on this focus on this has anybody ever
[3609.92 - 3615.04] taught us how to focus the mind okay
[3612.60 - 3616.40] focus okay still it is glorified
[3615.04 - 3618.32] everybody knows okay you need to focus
[3616.40 - 3620.60] to get to your goals has anybody told
[3618.32 - 3622.36] you the importance of defocusing if
[3620.60 - 3625.72] you're too focused can you fall asleep
[3622.36 - 3629.84] at night of course not so understand the
[3625.72 - 3632.96] mind it it how to use it where to use it
[3629.84 - 3637.08] how to switch it off how to not use it
[3632.96 - 3640.00] and go to sleep so all of these
[3637.08 - 3642.24] trainings have to be given to every
[3640.00 - 3644.36] individual irrespective of what age they
[3642.24 - 3646.64] are and that is why I think it's also
[3644.36 - 3648.40] called Mind muscle connection I was
[3646.64 - 3651.88] about to ask you about the Mind muscle
[3648.40 - 3654.04] connection that when you're working out
[3651.88 - 3657.28] uh do you need to be there in presence
[3654.04 - 3658.84] for that workout it makes sense no
[3657.28 - 3660.68] otherwise you just I keep telling people
[3658.84 - 3662.68] otherwise you're just moving the weight
[3660.68 - 3664.96] from point A to point B but there's
[3662.68 - 3668.00] nothing really happening in there it's
[3664.96 - 3669.96] just a mechanical action but what you're
[3668.00 - 3672.48] trying to do is you're trying to engage
[3669.96 - 3676.36] the muscles by that particular movement
[3672.48 - 3678.96] and that is why I say one breath one rep
[3676.36 - 3681.56] one breath one rep think about it when
[3678.96 - 3682.80] you're doing training for hypertrophy
[3681.56 - 3685.24] not functional training when you're
[3682.80 - 3687.20] training for hypertrophy every time you
[3685.24 - 3690.08] exert Force you breathe out what is
[3687.20 - 3691.44] hypertrophy is basically muscle growth
[3690.08 - 3693.44] okay so whenever you're doing weight
[3691.44 - 3694.76] training whether it's for fat loss
[3693.44 - 3696.24] whether hypotrophy but when are you
[3694.76 - 3698.20] doing weight training basically I'm want
[3696.24 - 3699.76] to bulk up my muscle yeah if if you're
[3698.20 - 3701.40] bulking up for the purpose of fat loss
[3699.76 - 3704.76] also that's fine but whenever you're
[3701.40 - 3707.12] using movements like bench press biceps
[3704.76 - 3708.88] squats deadlifts and you're doing
[3707.12 - 3710.52] isolation strength movements not
[3708.88 - 3712.16] functional movements which are out of
[3710.52 - 3715.56] control when it comes to heart rate and
[3712.16 - 3718.96] breath I always say one breath one RP so
[3715.56 - 3718.96] think every time you exert
[3721.00 - 3726.60] Force what that allows you to do is
[3723.40 - 3729.08] firstly it slows down the movement you
[3726.60 - 3731.28] get enough oxygen in your system to
[3729.08 - 3733.32] power through secondly because it's
[3731.28 - 3735.96] slowing it down you're able to connect
[3733.32 - 3738.40] that muscle much better you're able to
[3735.96 - 3740.32] engage every single muscle fiber whether
[3738.40 - 3743.04] it's your fast Twi it your slow Twi it
[3740.32 - 3746.24] you're able to feel it and that is what
[3743.04 - 3748.72] mind muscle connection is so when I tell
[3746.24 - 3750.36] people every time in your workouts do
[3748.72 - 3752.20] some sets where you're using only
[3750.36 - 3754.64] isolateral movement so one side of the
[3752.20 - 3755.80] body keep the other hand on that muscle
[3754.64 - 3757.28] of course when you're doing the back you
[3755.80 - 3759.12] can't but say if you're doing bicep if
[3757.28 - 3763.16] you're doing chest if you're doing cable
[3759.12 - 3766.36] flies feel the muscle feel it pump feel
[3763.16 - 3768.80] it engage CU then now your mind is now
[3766.36 - 3772.16] connected to how that muscle is moving
[3768.80 - 3774.52] and feeling now every single set after
[3772.16 - 3777.40] that when you do every single rep you
[3774.52 - 3780.80] will try to mimic the exact same feeling
[3777.40 - 3782.48] in the chest or the bicep or the tricep
[3780.80 - 3783.88] it really helps so when I do leg
[3782.48 - 3786.28] extensions or whatever I like to keep my
[3783.88 - 3788.76] hand on the leg and feel the muscles
[3786.28 - 3791.08] whether it's a bicep it it just helps
[3788.76 - 3794.48] even today even after 20 years of weight
[3791.08 - 3797.96] training it still feels good to know
[3794.48 - 3800.44] that hey it's it's there it's working
[3797.96 - 3802.84] but it feels good because you can feel
[3800.44 - 3804.20] the muscle it's not that you're doing
[3802.84 - 3806.72] biceps and you're feeling it in the
[3804.20 - 3808.36] shoulder oh my shoulder is hurting but
[3806.72 - 3810.16] you just did bicep why is your shoulder
[3808.36 - 3813.40] hurting I don't know I was doing this
[3810.16 - 3816.64] movement so then Focus now keep your
[3813.40 - 3818.60] coring gate stand still get your mind in
[3816.64 - 3821.76] the movement otherwise what are you
[3818.60 - 3823.04] training for why are you in the gym I
[3821.76 - 3826.44] don't
[3823.04 - 3830.20] understand it's probably because I love
[3826.44 - 3832.60] exercise so much that I get really
[3830.20 - 3835.88] emotional and passionate about it that
[3832.60 - 3838.36] it hurts when I see people doing things
[3835.88 - 3840.32] wrong I tell people in the gy you should
[3838.36 - 3842.76] be fined for doing wrong
[3840.32 - 3844.60] movements what the hell are you doing
[3842.76 - 3845.84] what is that no that's functional my
[3844.60 - 3847.60] trainer's given me I know who the
[3845.84 - 3850.28] trainer they we all
[3847.60 - 3853.20] friends that is not what what is that
[3850.28 - 3856.16] movement how is that helping and and is
[3853.20 - 3859.64] this the reason that we should always
[3856.16 - 3861.64] find Qualified trainers to trainers and
[3859.64 - 3864.56] the trainer should be mentally and
[3861.64 - 3866.40] physically present to guide people who
[3864.56 - 3868.36] don't know how to work out look you're
[3866.40 - 3870.24] an elite athlete you're an Elight coach
[3868.36 - 3872.32] you know how to work out but for the
[3870.24 - 3874.08] rest of us are uninitiated I still
[3872.32 - 3875.76] sometimes don't do a bicep call properly
[3874.08 - 3877.52] after 20 years but I tell you sometimes
[3875.76 - 3879.04] it's not the fault of the coach it's not
[3877.52 - 3881.60] the fault of the trainer and I've seen
[3879.04 - 3883.72] this trainers giving the right exercise
[3881.60 - 3886.00] and the right program to the client the
[3883.72 - 3886.00] client
[3886.44 - 3892.36] says kg my part sir but you've been
[3889.92 - 3894.64] doing 5 kgs for the last one year don't
[3892.36 - 3897.88] you want to see
[3894.64 - 3900.56] Improvement to even the trainers
[3897.88 - 3902.00] like so some it's not always the fault
[3900.56 - 3904.32] of the trainer because see somewhere the
[3902.00 - 3905.56] trainers are also they're like if I
[3904.32 - 3908.24] don't do it he's going to go to somebody
[3905.56 - 3910.36] else so India has this thought I don't
[3908.24 - 3913.36] need to go to the gym Shivam has big
[3910.36 - 3915.80] muscles
[3913.36 - 3919.04] right so everyone's thinking yoga
[3915.80 - 3921.92] Pilatus walking all of the general
[3919.04 - 3924.68] exercises tell us how important is
[3921.92 - 3926.52] muscle towards anti-aging and the
[3924.68 - 3928.72] reduction of heart attack
[3926.52 - 3931.12] and reduction of blood
[3928.72 - 3934.84] pressure resech research has actually
[3931.12 - 3937.84] proven that India is the lowest today
[3934.84 - 3939.56] when it comes to people with quality
[3937.84 - 3942.12] functional muscle in the rest of the
[3939.56 - 3944.88] world amongst the whole world India is
[3942.12 - 3947.36] the lowest and if you go to see it's not
[3944.88 - 3950.24] actually that hard yes you're absolutely
[3947.36 - 3952.32] right the mind is the superpower but the
[3950.24 - 3954.64] biggest organ today is the muscle it's
[3952.32 - 3956.52] where everything is happening inside the
[3954.64 - 3958.64] muscle when when they say muscle is
[3956.52 - 3960.84] metabolically active what it means is
[3958.64 - 3962.76] that unless and until you don't feed it
[3960.84 - 3965.56] with the right nutrition and you don't
[3962.76 - 3967.64] engage it with exercise you are going to
[3965.56 - 3970.44] lose it for a person who doesn't
[3967.64 - 3973.44] exercise after the age of 35 till the
[3970.44 - 3975.12] time they they die they are losing a
[3973.44 - 3977.80] certain percentage of muscle every
[3975.12 - 3979.80] single year and what we also people
[3977.80 - 3981.60] don't realize is that muscles have a
[3979.80 - 3985.08] certain amount of triglycerides within
[3981.60 - 3987.20] them for energy sake but people who
[3985.08 - 3990.20] you'll see lot of people in the gym who
[3987.20 - 3992.44] can't even squat like they struggle it
[3990.20 - 3994.80] is not because that they don't have the
[3992.44 - 3997.84] strength the muscles have become
[3994.80 - 3999.68] dysfunctional the fat has overtaken in
[3997.84 - 4001.32] it's I heard it in another episode it's
[3999.68 - 4003.84] like you're literally packing your
[4001.32 - 4005.44] suitcase with clothes where to a point
[4003.84 - 4008.08] now the clothes are kind of overflowing
[4005.44 - 4010.12] from the suitcase so the whole point is
[4008.08 - 4012.52] open the suitcase start removing all the
[4010.12 - 4015.08] excess fat from it by training and
[4012.52 - 4017.16] weight training is the best way to do it
[4015.08 - 4020.44] and start getting the functionality of
[4017.16 - 4022.04] the muscle back why muscle is what looks
[4020.44 - 4024.56] after your blood
[4022.04 - 4027.36] pressure muscle is what basically
[4024.56 - 4029.00] controls your insulin sensitivity muscle
[4027.36 - 4031.44] is what controls your blood glucose
[4029.00 - 4034.00] levels controls your heart rate controls
[4031.44 - 4036.44] your joint health the majority of the
[4034.00 - 4037.76] deaths that happen in senior citizens is
[4036.44 - 4040.32] because of
[4037.76 - 4042.12] falling either they die because of that
[4040.32 - 4043.72] or they die either because they're in
[4042.12 - 4045.96] the hospital recovering from that and
[4043.72 - 4048.32] they end up getting something else and
[4045.96 - 4050.48] simple reason muscle has slow twitch
[4048.32 - 4052.36] fast twitch fibers slow twitch fibers
[4050.48 - 4054.12] are the ones responsible for strength
[4052.36 - 4056.48] fast ttch are the ones responsible for
[4054.12 - 4058.56] explosive sudden movements what happens
[4056.48 - 4061.00] when you fall or when you slip the
[4058.56 - 4063.12] minute you slip your legs move to kind
[4061.00 - 4065.24] of balance you out that is your fast
[4063.12 - 4067.92] twitch fibers and what helps you break
[4065.24 - 4069.76] that fall is your slow twitch fibers you
[4067.92 - 4071.80] don't have to train separately for it
[4069.76 - 4074.80] you just have to train so that tomorrow
[4071.80 - 4077.60] when you fall you will slip or you'll
[4074.80 - 4080.56] lunge but you won't slip and break your
[4077.60 - 4083.28] hand or wrist or it actually happened to
[4080.56 - 4084.88] me two three months back and I was going
[4083.28 - 4087.28] from the gym I was crossing the pool
[4084.88 - 4089.24] side and going down and I slipped but I
[4087.28 - 4091.84] fell into a beautiful Lune and I had my
[4089.24 - 4093.60] suitcase on me the next day I came a
[4091.84 - 4095.76] suitcase my gym literally like a
[4093.60 - 4097.28] suitcase the next day I came to the gym
[4095.76 - 4099.60] and one of the gym instructors she told
[4097.28 - 4099.60] me she
[4102.68 - 4106.12] like it's actually a true thing I'm not
[4104.76 - 4109.20] making this up
[4106.12 - 4112.12] but this is what I mean I'm not training
[4109.20 - 4115.92] differently to protect my muscles or
[4112.12 - 4117.76] protect my joints and that is why muscle
[4115.92 - 4122.64] needs to be given that much more
[4117.76 - 4124.68] importance today because again I don't
[4122.64 - 4126.84] you can actually help me on this point
[4124.68 - 4129.96] and maybe correct me on this point
[4126.84 - 4132.92] people think fruits are the healthiest
[4129.96 - 4135.48] food items in the world they can eat all
[4132.92 - 4137.64] the fruits they want and they'll be fine
[4135.48 - 4140.64] but fruit is still sugar am I right
[4137.64 - 4142.92] you're right yes if but you need to have
[4140.64 - 4145.48] fruit not from the energy point of view
[4142.92 - 4146.92] but from the antioxidants the nutritive
[4145.48 - 4150.20] perspective so if they're having a bowl
[4146.92 - 4153.20] of fruit first thing in the morning and
[4150.20 - 4154.76] this person is a non-training individual
[4153.20 - 4157.16] what is happening to that food oh it's
[4154.76 - 4159.00] going sugar and liver and fat now who
[4157.16 - 4160.68] will explain this when I whenever we
[4159.00 - 4162.88] travel it's nice that you are saying it
[4160.68 - 4165.04] when no because it's it's I like I said
[4162.88 - 4167.32] I I always say one thing whenever I'm
[4165.04 - 4169.60] giving it any talk or webinars I could
[4167.32 - 4172.16] be wrong so if I am please do correct me
[4169.60 - 4173.72] at any point cuz I could be wrong but
[4172.16 - 4175.80] whenever we travel and we go to hotels
[4173.72 - 4178.20] and we see people Stack Up on fruits
[4175.80 - 4180.84] first thing in the morning and you can
[4178.20 - 4183.72] tell that person doesn't go to the gym
[4180.84 - 4186.16] even if okay even if they did proper
[4183.72 - 4188.12] working like say for my example myself
[4186.16 - 4190.84] and that day I've just have not gone to
[4188.12 - 4193.40] the gym I can still afford to eat some
[4190.84 - 4196.16] fruit I think it comes from this concept
[4193.40 - 4198.32] India is a health loving Nation not a
[4196.16 - 4200.60] health doing Nation so here's the
[4198.32 - 4200.60] thought
[4202.00 - 4205.00] process
[4206.72 - 4210.80] exercise so it's going to be difficult
[4209.24 - 4212.28] to do that and I think from that
[4210.80 - 4215.48] perspective is where people come with
[4212.28 - 4217.36] this whole concept what I tell people or
[4215.48 - 4219.80] what you can encourage people in your
[4217.36 - 4222.64] gym is there one line that I keep using
[4219.80 - 4225.56] for everybody out there which is muscle
[4222.64 - 4227.40] is the only age reversible organ in the
[4225.56 - 4230.04] human body absolutely how beautifully
[4227.40 - 4233.16] you put it so at any time I mean the
[4230.04 - 4235.96] brain doesn't age so the mind doesn't
[4233.16 - 4238.36] age technically but the muscle requires
[4235.96 - 4241.28] work correct and that work requires you
[4238.36 - 4243.44] to put some resistance to that muscle so
[4241.28 - 4245.64] stretching only doesn't work walking
[4243.44 - 4248.32] only doesn't work there needs to be that
[4245.64 - 4250.28] resistance which what I have read needs
[4248.32 - 4252.96] to be more than what your muscle is
[4250.28 - 4254.28] normally given Progressive overload what
[4252.96 - 4257.44] we call so I was hearing a very good
[4254.28 - 4260.96] podcast on anti-aging and he said very
[4257.44 - 4263.84] something very uh logical and something
[4260.96 - 4265.64] very amazing stress needs to be put in
[4263.84 - 4267.92] the B so when we do cold showers when we
[4265.64 - 4270.36] do sauna when we do all of that the
[4267.92 - 4273.52] whole idea behind that and anti-aging is
[4270.36 - 4276.32] that somewhere you are putting your body
[4273.52 - 4278.12] through adversity you're causing through
[4276.32 - 4280.40] a challenge you're causing a little a
[4278.12 - 4283.60] small amount of stress which then
[4280.40 - 4286.00] triggers the body to release its uh
[4283.60 - 4287.36] immune system its anti aging system
[4286.00 - 4290.44] which automatically work as an
[4287.36 - 4293.12] anti-aging it self-defense mechanism and
[4290.44 - 4295.44] that's what it is the reason why you put
[4293.12 - 4297.24] yourself in cold showers and all of that
[4295.44 - 4299.28] in in situations which are not
[4297.24 - 4301.44] comfortable which are not normal and
[4299.28 - 4303.80] throwing your body out of homeostasis or
[4301.44 - 4306.16] balance is so that your body thinks that
[4303.80 - 4308.08] there's something which is unnatural
[4306.16 - 4309.80] happening so I need to protect myself
[4308.08 - 4312.28] because the first priority of the body
[4309.80 - 4315.40] is always going to be survival and like
[4312.28 - 4317.32] you said as long as you put a little bit
[4315.40 - 4320.80] stressed today for one week you've done
[4317.32 - 4322.80] 5 kgs next week try to do 7.5 maybe
[4320.80 - 4324.44] reduce the Reps a little bit that is
[4322.80 - 4326.92] what is called Progressive overload then
[4324.44 - 4329.52] go back to 7.5 and complete the number
[4326.92 - 4332.08] of reps you did the first week every
[4329.52 - 4334.76] single week you are tweaking the stress
[4332.08 - 4336.84] a little bit a little bit not too much
[4334.76 - 4339.40] because that too much can be detrimental
[4336.84 - 4342.08] just enough so that your body has to
[4339.40 - 4344.76] adapt to that stress and that adaptation
[4342.08 - 4346.24] is what causes progress I think over
[4344.76 - 4348.76] here
[4346.24 - 4352.08] I want to bring Renda in because
[4348.76 - 4353.80] whenever I go to the gym right or I do
[4352.08 - 4356.56] the cold showers by the way for the cold
[4353.80 - 4358.20] showers uh just the point for for you
[4356.56 - 4361.00] you're absolutely right on the cold
[4358.20 - 4362.56] showers 6 hours later it releases
[4361.00 - 4364.96] something known as brain derived
[4362.56 - 4367.00] neurotropic Factor yes which actually
[4364.96 - 4370.12] goes and socks your brain into saying I
[4367.00 - 4374.32] love the workout amazing so cold showers
[4370.12 - 4377.96] are amazing absolutely but most people
[4374.32 - 4381.24] my clients when they come rinda they
[4377.96 - 4383.04] complain time I don't want to do this I
[4381.24 - 4385.92] don't want to do that I don't want to do
[4383.04 - 4389.52] this this is so difficult uh there is
[4385.92 - 4393.68] there's no driver today so how do we
[4389.52 - 4395.84] Prime the mind to understand that what
[4393.68 - 4398.32] Shivam is saying is that you need to
[4395.84 - 4400.40] build resistance you need to increase
[4398.32 - 4401.92] Progressive load before all of that
[4400.40 - 4404.56] everyone standing outside the gym
[4401.92 - 4406.88] looking inside uh this is very difficult
[4404.56 - 4409.08] to do I don't think I can do this and
[4406.88 - 4411.40] then they give up there so how do we go
[4409.08 - 4413.20] get there for them from this to saying
[4411.40 - 4415.36] ke okay here's my gym bank here my gym
[4413.20 - 4419.00] gloves here's my shoes let's get started
[4415.36 - 4421.96] and not run away so it starts Ryan with
[4419.00 - 4423.08] identifying what is important for you
[4421.96 - 4425.20] the thing that people are really
[4423.08 - 4427.28] struggling with is Clarity should we
[4425.20 - 4429.92] write down our goals yes yes I was just
[4427.28 - 4432.88] going to say that to get clarity please
[4429.92 - 4435.64] take a piece of paper and write down
[4432.88 - 4438.68] what do you want supposing you are
[4435.64 - 4440.20] uh 70 years of age or imagine yourself
[4438.68 - 4443.88] when you're 70 and you want to look back
[4440.20 - 4445.84] at life how do you wish to have led it
[4443.88 - 4447.76] so write it down okay I'm successful I
[4445.84 - 4450.36] have good health when you're saying good
[4447.76 - 4453.28] health then you will have to put in the
[4450.36 - 4456.04] work so it is a mindset that you need to
[4453.28 - 4457.92] develop which starts with Clarity it
[4456.04 - 4459.96] will then you will do the practices to
[4457.92 - 4461.80] develop the will and there's a beautiful
[4459.96 - 4465.08] line which says if you think you can and
[4461.80 - 4467.16] if you think you can't you're right you
[4465.08 - 4469.36] stand outside and say I can't do this
[4467.16 - 4472.44] you can't do this you peeping out and
[4469.36 - 4473.72] saying I can do this I can do this so
[4472.44 - 4476.64] understanding this is your power and
[4473.72 - 4478.44] there's no judgment you don't want to do
[4476.64 - 4481.04] it don't say you can't you don't want to
[4478.44 - 4481.88] do it I can understand then you can't
[4481.04 - 4485.16] blame
[4481.88 - 4486.92] anyone take responsibility of your life
[4485.16 - 4488.24] you cannot live your life saying I don't
[4486.92 - 4490.48] have the good coach I don't have the
[4488.24 - 4492.00] perfect diet we can't go to the gym
[4490.48 - 4494.08] Shivam is coming to the house also so
[4492.00 - 4497.28] everything is online now for us in fact
[4494.08 - 4499.96] so everything is available to you so
[4497.28 - 4501.48] time has come to stop making excuses if
[4499.96 - 4504.72] you're making excuses then stop
[4501.48 - 4507.20] complaining then don't complain so I
[4504.72 - 4509.36] teach people to take responsibility of
[4507.20 - 4512.16] their life this one human being should
[4509.36 - 4514.44] not become a problem and somebody else
[4512.16 - 4518.36] is not your problem I always tell my
[4514.44 - 4521.68] wife you're not my life partner I my
[4518.36 - 4524.52] body is my life partner and you I am
[4521.68 - 4526.96] married to where we go on this journey
[4524.52 - 4529.40] together where my body which is my life
[4526.96 - 4532.48] partner and your body life partner they
[4529.40 - 4535.40] become gym Partners your also
[4532.48 - 4537.52] connected the reason why we want to be
[4535.40 - 4539.20] healthy is so that we don't end up being
[4537.52 - 4542.00] a burden on other people and we can
[4539.20 - 4544.40] actually look after people we love if
[4542.00 - 4547.08] tomorrow you are unhealthy yourself and
[4544.40 - 4548.96] you are always falling sick and you
[4547.08 - 4550.44] can't do things and you've got aches and
[4548.96 - 4551.96] pains and tomorrow if you have to look
[4550.44 - 4554.48] after your children or look after your
[4551.96 - 4557.52] parents or whoever how are you going to
[4554.48 - 4560.44] do it in this matter you have to be
[4557.52 - 4562.72] selfish you have to come first so that
[4560.44 - 4564.48] you can then look after people you love
[4562.72 - 4568.04] this is very important especially for
[4564.48 - 4572.12] women Ryan because and when women have a
[4568.04 - 4574.60] newly born baby or even in how they are
[4572.12 - 4576.12] they're nurturers they love nurturing
[4574.60 - 4577.80] they love taking care of their family
[4576.12 - 4581.24] whether it's a young child or their
[4577.80 - 4584.12] husbands or whoever is there in-laws
[4581.24 - 4585.84] parents and I need need to actually
[4584.12 - 4586.96] train them
[4585.84 - 4590.16] to
[4586.96 - 4592.96] prioritize themselves yes themselves I
[4590.16 - 4595.88] and this is the reasoning I give if you
[4592.96 - 4597.96] are not fine how will you take care of
[4595.88 - 4600.16] all the people that you think you have
[4597.96 - 4603.00] the responsibility of how will you do
[4600.16 - 4604.20] that so this is a very interesting uh
[4603.00 - 4606.56] example I wanted to give you I was
[4604.20 - 4608.48] training one of the corporate uh female
[4606.56 - 4610.56] who was in a very Superior position in a
[4608.48 - 4612.64] corporate and she had a board meeting a
[4610.56 - 4614.92] very stressful day so we were doing a
[4612.64 - 4616.96] session in the car so on the way back we
[4614.92 - 4619.68] were doing a video session in the
[4616.96 - 4621.56] car and she's like rinda I'm so stressed
[4619.68 - 4623.68] and she had a young baby she said R I'm
[4621.56 - 4626.76] so stressed I just want to go and hug my
[4623.68 - 4628.92] child and uh that everything becomes
[4626.76 - 4631.88] fine when I hug my baby I said you stop
[4628.92 - 4634.24] your car right now he says you will
[4631.88 - 4636.80] never ever hug your child when you're
[4634.24 - 4639.12] depleted why would you PCH energy off
[4636.80 - 4642.24] your baby you're supposed to be giving
[4639.12 - 4644.88] the energy I said you stop you Rectify
[4642.24 - 4646.68] your energy right now so she literally
[4644.88 - 4648.68] parked her car I mean the driver was
[4646.68 - 4650.76] there so they parked we did some breath
[4648.68 - 4653.36] work we did some visualization she
[4650.76 - 4654.52] became fine breath always works Ryan
[4653.36 - 4656.56] because that's the way you change the
[4654.52 - 4658.04] mind how are we when we angry and
[4656.56 - 4660.72] agitated and anxious we breathe a
[4658.04 - 4662.68] certain way it's shallow shut and fast
[4660.72 - 4665.04] you lengthen the breath use the
[4662.68 - 4667.92] diaphragm the parasympathetic system
[4665.04 - 4670.96] rest and digest system has to kick in
[4667.92 - 4673.36] within 7 to 10 minutes she was fine I
[4670.96 - 4675.92] said now you're ready to go home fully
[4673.36 - 4678.92] energized not fully not it's the end of
[4675.92 - 4679.88] the day but not depleted go home now you
[4678.92 - 4682.72] hug your
[4679.88 - 4685.84] baby understand the change begins with
[4682.72 - 4687.68] you if you want any change in your life
[4685.84 - 4688.96] it starts with Mahatma Gandhi said it
[4687.68 - 4691.20] beautiful saying right outside the
[4688.96 - 4692.92] office as well you become the change
[4691.20 - 4695.32] that you wish to see you want your
[4692.92 - 4698.28] family life to be peaceful you become
[4695.32 - 4701.64] peaceful you want success in your life
[4698.28 - 4703.88] you become success as a life first do
[4701.64 - 4706.40] everything right but it begins with you
[4703.88 - 4709.52] you can't neglect your own physical
[4706.40 - 4712.28] mental emotional well-being and expect
[4709.52 - 4713.36] to see that in your relatives it's not
[4712.28 - 4715.96] going to
[4713.36 - 4718.44] happen it begins with you the change
[4715.96 - 4720.92] begins with you and prioritize I do this
[4718.44 - 4723.36] for newly for mothers who have newborn
[4720.92 - 4726.12] babies do you know how hard it is for
[4723.36 - 4727.88] them to take out time for themselves I
[4726.12 - 4729.00] said but if you don't do this everything
[4727.88 - 4731.16] else gets
[4729.00 - 4732.64] jeopardized even your uh I think even
[4731.16 - 4735.80] your milk secretion gets jeopardized
[4732.64 - 4737.60] with your stress levels so all of that
[4735.80 - 4739.88] has to be taken into account your
[4737.60 - 4741.04] relation people's when there are young
[4739.88 - 4743.08] mothers their relationship with their
[4741.04 - 4745.92] husbands starts suffering because the
[4743.08 - 4749.24] mothers are not emotionally they still
[4745.92 - 4752.00] finding their footing in this new space
[4749.24 - 4754.32] so postpartum is a real thing but how
[4752.00 - 4756.36] every single female experiences uh
[4754.32 - 4759.08] postpartum is totally up to the
[4756.36 - 4762.04] practices that they do for themselves
[4759.08 - 4764.84] which are extremely extremely important
[4762.04 - 4766.80] so yes your question was that you think
[4764.84 - 4769.76] you can't be as peeping from
[4766.80 - 4771.28] outside no time has come to not make
[4769.76 - 4774.60] excuses if you want a change in your
[4771.28 - 4776.48] life please make the changes if you're
[4774.60 - 4778.52] not making the changes then please
[4776.48 - 4780.28] accept your destiny nobody's judging you
[4778.52 - 4782.00] you want to cry sit in one corner and
[4780.28 - 4783.92] cry and do the blame game your
[4782.00 - 4785.96] prerogative but don't expect your life
[4783.92 - 4789.20] to change if you don't change I had I
[4785.96 - 4791.40] had a client who uh joined my program
[4789.20 - 4794.76] and she's like I can't do the whole
[4791.40 - 4796.88] workout but I want to train what do I do
[4794.76 - 4799.28] I said let's do something very simple
[4796.88 - 4801.44] for the next 2 weeks let's just do the
[4799.28 - 4802.80] warm-up let's just do the 10 minutes of
[4801.44 - 4806.08] warm-up nothing else you won't do
[4802.80 - 4808.92] anything else after that let's add the
[4806.08 - 4810.92] next part to it after 2 weeks one month
[4808.92 - 4813.32] went past she messaged me said all right
[4810.92 - 4814.68] so I've every single day I woke up and I
[4813.32 - 4816.72] did the warm-up and I did after two
[4814.68 - 4818.68] weeks I added the other part I said okay
[4816.72 - 4820.48] now let's add the third part so we
[4818.68 - 4822.76] usually in my online programs there's a
[4820.48 - 4824.32] warm-up activation there's a small
[4822.76 - 4825.84] weighted workout functional workout and
[4824.32 - 4827.56] a course so I said okay now let's just
[4825.84 - 4831.20] add the weighted workout we won't add
[4827.56 - 4834.12] functional right now after 2 months she
[4831.20 - 4836.36] started doing the entire thing after
[4834.12 - 4838.20] three or four months she messaged me say
[4836.36 - 4840.28] Sir workouts are going great I've been
[4838.20 - 4842.20] consistent I can do the whole workout
[4840.28 - 4845.32] intensity is increasing I've lost all
[4842.20 - 4848.12] the weight so how did it start it all
[4845.32 - 4851.32] started with just the warmup your
[4848.12 - 4853.40] willingness to do the fact yes you can't
[4851.32 - 4855.96] take away that aspect from her that she
[4853.40 - 4857.56] wanted to make a change
[4855.96 - 4860.08] yes at that point and this is probably
[4857.56 - 4862.28] 99% of the people who want to but their
[4860.08 - 4866.04] physical bodies are in a state where
[4862.28 - 4869.20] they cannot do the entire thing start
[4866.04 - 4872.08] slow I say initially as a beginner
[4869.20 - 4874.44] you'll be surprised but just learning
[4872.08 - 4876.96] the skill of lifting a weight with an
[4874.44 - 4878.80] empty bar will give you the results
[4876.96 - 4880.40] because more than the muscles at that
[4878.80 - 4882.20] point it's more of your neurological
[4880.40 - 4884.68] system which causes the progressive
[4882.20 - 4886.24] overload which causes the adaptation you
[4884.68 - 4887.48] see all these new people come and you
[4886.24 - 4888.68] know their hands are shaking while
[4887.48 - 4891.40] they're doing dumbles and they can't
[4888.68 - 4893.96] even get themselves that's a very normal
[4891.40 - 4896.76] thing so imagine just getting that right
[4893.96 - 4898.96] first that itself can get my feet fixed
[4896.76 - 4901.20] in position embrace my core get the
[4898.96 - 4904.40] hands tight move the weight even if it's
[4901.20 - 4907.28] 2 kgs without anything that itself will
[4904.40 - 4908.36] cause change you don't have to jump into
[4907.28 - 4910.60] the deep
[4908.36 - 4913.36] end sometimes you can start with the
[4910.60 - 4915.08] most basic basic movement but you do
[4913.36 - 4916.68] have to dip your feet in the water
[4915.08 - 4918.24] so I used to teach when I was in
[4916.68 - 4920.96] Australia I used to teach kids how to
[4918.24 - 4923.56] swim infants all the way up to Squad
[4920.96 - 4924.96] which is like 18 years and the infants
[4923.56 - 4926.52] how they how we used to introduce them
[4924.96 - 4928.20] to water was the parents would bring
[4926.52 - 4930.56] them the father would stand in the water
[4928.20 - 4932.48] the he'd hold the child and we'd have
[4930.56 - 4934.96] this chani this the bucket with the
[4932.48 - 4937.04] holes and just get the kid used to the
[4934.96 - 4938.72] water then after that once the kid is
[4937.04 - 4940.16] used to you also then after some time
[4938.72 - 4941.84] the father moves away and then you kind
[4940.16 - 4945.32] of hold the kid and make him swim around
[4941.84 - 4946.80] and this and that and slowly slowly step
[4945.32 - 4950.92] by step you kind of move him along the
[4946.80 - 4954.16] railing and then he swims but it starts
[4950.92 - 4957.28] slow and I think as a
[4954.16 - 4958.96] coach that uh confidence is something
[4957.28 - 4960.76] that you need to give your
[4958.96 - 4963.16] client it's
[4960.76 - 4967.28] possible the other day I put up a video
[4963.16 - 4968.64] of a muscle up saying that the muscle up
[4967.28 - 4971.20] is not a measure of
[4968.64 - 4973.72] Fitness because 99% of the people are
[4971.20 - 4976.08] not even looking at doing a muscle up it
[4973.72 - 4977.84] is a beautiful movement it gets you in
[4976.08 - 4979.40] your all upper body muscles and
[4977.84 - 4981.92] everything it's great but don't get
[4979.40 - 4983.96] infatuated with this movement because
[4981.92 - 4987.00] there are a lot of people who see these
[4983.96 - 4988.08] videos today on social media and they
[4987.00 - 4989.96] get
[4988.08 - 4991.80] intimidated they see someone doing
[4989.96 - 4993.56] muscle ups and 300 kg deadlifts and
[4991.80 - 4996.32] everything and they feel like this is
[4993.56 - 4998.56] not my scene so that is when the coach
[4996.32 - 5000.76] needs to come in and say you don't have
[4998.56 - 5002.08] to you don't have to do that we're going
[5000.76 - 5004.88] to the other end of the gym and we're
[5002.08 - 5007.56] just going to do something really simple
[5004.88 - 5009.24] so as a client you literally need to
[5007.56 - 5011.84] handle the client as an infant as a
[5009.24 - 5014.04] newborn child when they enter the gym to
[5011.84 - 5018.12] give them that confidence to give them
[5014.04 - 5020.68] that sense of Safety and Security once
[5018.12 - 5023.92] they get comfortable then they can play
[5020.68 - 5026.56] with the big boys then but it's not even
[5023.92 - 5028.24] going to the gym anymore even if at home
[5026.56 - 5030.60] training at home you can develop muscles
[5028.24 - 5032.68] training at home but the ideas to start
[5030.60 - 5035.40] with the most ideas will start with the
[5032.68 - 5037.24] most simplest thing and then move up
[5035.40 - 5039.68] there's one thing that we didn't discuss
[5037.24 - 5041.16] today uh maybe a little bit we talk
[5039.68 - 5042.64] about the science we talked about the
[5041.16 - 5045.08] mind we talked about the muscle the
[5042.64 - 5048.28] muscle science the Mind
[5045.08 - 5051.96] science the biggest excuse that people
[5048.28 - 5054.92] have is I don't have
[5051.96 - 5056.16] time shivom what's your take rinda you
[5054.92 - 5060.16] go next
[5056.16 - 5063.04] on if you can justify it being a
[5060.16 - 5066.36] priority so i' I've heard it in a lot of
[5063.04 - 5070.24] videos If you you can justify 30 minutes
[5066.36 - 5072.96] of exercise being more important than 30
[5070.24 - 5075.48] minutes of Netflix or a documentary or
[5072.96 - 5078.08] something that you want to watch you've
[5075.48 - 5081.52] won the thing youve won the battle it's
[5078.08 - 5083.64] just that you need to replace something
[5081.52 - 5086.20] with that 30 minutes of exercise and for
[5083.64 - 5088.40] that you need to justify that 30 minutes
[5086.20 - 5092.08] of exercise being a priority in why it
[5088.40 - 5094.76] is important and somewhere that has to
[5092.08 - 5097.04] be attached rather than to the weighing
[5094.76 - 5099.20] scale or to a six pack it has to be
[5097.04 - 5101.36] attached to something a little bit more
[5099.20 - 5104.00] emotional how are you going to feel when
[5101.36 - 5106.00] you actually get that goal what is that
[5104.00 - 5107.56] going to make you feel how is it going
[5106.00 - 5109.52] to change your life how is it going to
[5107.56 - 5112.28] change your perspective or other
[5109.52 - 5115.44] people's perspective towards you I think
[5112.28 - 5118.36] if people can get that emotional aspect
[5115.44 - 5121.48] rather than the tangible goal and
[5118.36 - 5124.36] everybody everybody knows exercise is
[5121.48 - 5126.16] important today everybody knows
[5124.36 - 5127.56] everybody knows eating is important so
[5126.16 - 5131.92] they know
[5127.56 - 5136.32] it they just need to justify it being a
[5131.92 - 5137.40] priority brinda I have no time is the is
[5136.32 - 5140.80] the biggest
[5137.40 - 5142.68] excuse um I always say yes time is a
[5140.80 - 5144.32] finite commodity it's the same for you
[5142.68 - 5147.84] me or anybody else in the
[5144.32 - 5150.20] world but if You observe any successful
[5147.84 - 5152.40] person we've trained a lot of those
[5150.20 - 5154.84] successful people we you can't even
[5152.40 - 5156.48] imagine how busy their days are
[5154.84 - 5159.60] we have trained people who have even
[5156.48 - 5163.20] worked out at 3:00 a.m. and then sat for
[5159.60 - 5164.80] makeup and then or had 16 hour long days
[5163.20 - 5166.84] and then made time for a 30- minute
[5164.80 - 5169.52] workout and breath work and
[5166.84 - 5171.56] pranayams so again it comes like it is
[5169.52 - 5173.28] not even like sh mention validation how
[5171.56 - 5176.44] it'll make you feel that's great to
[5173.28 - 5180.24] begin with but eventually you will have
[5176.44 - 5183.24] to do it for you you have to identify
[5180.24 - 5186.28] this is good for me this is going this
[5183.24 - 5188.48] is something that I want it and I'm
[5186.28 - 5190.68] going to apply my energies for doing it
[5188.48 - 5193.08] and the crazy part is Ryan once you have
[5190.68 - 5194.80] identified this is important important
[5193.08 - 5197.92] for me whether if somebody validates me
[5194.80 - 5200.68] or no irrespective I validate my own
[5197.92 - 5203.28] actions when you do that time will be
[5200.68 - 5206.20] get time will actually get made for you
[5203.28 - 5207.96] it actually gets created for you if Mr
[5206.20 - 5211.24] butan can find time to train between two
[5207.96 - 5213.84] episodes of KBC anybody else nobody else
[5211.24 - 5216.56] has an excuse I've learned so much from
[5213.84 - 5219.00] him knowing what is important for you
[5216.56 - 5220.72] and then just do it the will the
[5219.00 - 5223.04] discipline the time
[5220.72 - 5225.04] management and once you decided this is
[5223.04 - 5227.16] important for me I'm going to do it time
[5225.04 - 5228.60] will get made for you this is the beauty
[5227.16 - 5232.36] of manifestation
[5228.60 - 5235.44] again so let's move into um a quicker
[5232.36 - 5238.32] mode uh a rapid fire Shivam this is for
[5235.44 - 5241.68] you does lifting weights make women
[5238.32 - 5243.48] bulky not at all makes them strong I
[5241.68 - 5245.80] want to ask you rinda that same question
[5243.48 - 5247.16] because you are a train and a mind coach
[5245.80 - 5249.72] no it does not cuz I've been training
[5247.16 - 5251.00] with weights my entire life um I think
[5249.72 - 5252.84] all the weight loss and the weight gain
[5251.00 - 5254.72] all nutrition is a very big part of it
[5252.84 - 5255.92] and women don't have that level of
[5254.72 - 5258.40] testosterone that you're going to get
[5255.92 - 5260.08] really bulky but yes they can feel
[5258.40 - 5261.52] little bulky because suddenly they feel
[5260.08 - 5263.16] they arms are looking slightly bigger
[5261.52 - 5265.04] they just have to wait for the fat to
[5263.16 - 5267.28] disappear and they'll see the beautiful
[5265.04 - 5268.80] Cuts wait for the fat to disappear
[5267.28 - 5271.76] weight training is highly recommended
[5268.80 - 5274.52] for women is cardio necessary every day
[5271.76 - 5276.16] for weight loss in a gym not every day
[5274.52 - 5278.44] because at the end of the day it is how
[5276.16 - 5279.80] you expend that amount of energy so
[5278.44 - 5280.84] whether you're doing it through cardio
[5279.80 - 5282.68] you're doing it through weights you're
[5280.84 - 5285.16] doing it through functional training or
[5282.68 - 5287.60] just your activity throughout the day
[5285.16 - 5290.56] doesn't really matter is strength
[5287.60 - 5293.96] training more effective than cardio for
[5290.56 - 5295.44] fat loss absolutely how so strength
[5293.96 - 5297.60] training you're again working on
[5295.44 - 5299.08] building muscle we all know that the
[5297.60 - 5300.72] more muscle you have because it is
[5299.08 - 5303.12] metabolically active it needs more
[5300.72 - 5305.24] energy to survive automatically you are
[5303.12 - 5306.88] raising your BMR now it's not that
[5305.24 - 5308.52] you're raising it through 1,000 calories
[5306.88 - 5310.92] or 10,000 calories which you're raising
[5308.52 - 5313.24] it minimally but that minimal increase
[5310.92 - 5314.84] in the BMR will assist you in burning
[5313.24 - 5317.08] more calories when you're sitting and
[5314.84 - 5318.92] doing absolutely nothing than you would
[5317.08 - 5319.88] when you are you know on the treadmill
[5318.92 - 5321.56] and you can use strength trining
[5319.88 - 5324.24] movements in a
[5321.56 - 5326.08] cardio does a plant-based diet provide
[5324.24 - 5328.24] enough of protein for muscle
[5326.08 - 5330.28] building when we talk about protein we
[5328.24 - 5333.00] talk about amino acids we all know that
[5330.28 - 5335.52] okay fair enough plant-base is not a
[5333.00 - 5337.40] complete protein but when thankfully
[5335.52 - 5339.72] being in an Indian culture when you do
[5337.40 - 5341.16] mix up all the ingredients together your
[5339.72 - 5343.88] Dal your subies your grains and
[5341.16 - 5346.92] everything thei rice you do end up
[5343.88 - 5349.40] making most of the amino acids depending
[5346.92 - 5350.80] on your goal you might require a little
[5349.40 - 5353.12] bit more you can always go for a
[5350.80 - 5356.20] plant-based supplement but it's not
[5353.12 - 5358.92] necessary that you need to have uh meat
[5356.20 - 5361.12] or other forms of animal
[5358.92 - 5362.72] products this is a trending question
[5361.12 - 5365.28] right now is it better to work out in
[5362.72 - 5369.08] the morning or better to work out at
[5365.28 - 5370.72] night um ideally it is good to work out
[5369.08 - 5372.24] in the morning because you're in sync
[5370.72 - 5374.28] with nature but there are a lot of
[5372.24 - 5376.84] people whose jobs and lifestyle would
[5374.28 - 5378.60] not allow that and for them working out
[5376.84 - 5380.92] in the evening or in the night is fine
[5378.60 - 5382.80] as long as they do other things to
[5380.92 - 5384.68] compensate for working out in the night
[5382.80 - 5386.44] because we know that in the night your
[5384.68 - 5389.24] body is going to sleep your body needs
[5386.44 - 5392.08] to rest engaging your nervous system is
[5389.24 - 5394.32] not the best thing to do so do certain
[5392.08 - 5396.72] kind of breath Works to again you know
[5394.32 - 5399.52] release that cortisol from your system
[5396.72 - 5402.20] and you're fine is it necessary to take
[5399.52 - 5403.96] supplements for a workout it's not
[5402.20 - 5405.60] necessary but it completely depends on
[5403.96 - 5407.20] your goal if you are a bodybuilder if
[5405.60 - 5409.72] you are an athlete if you're looking for
[5407.20 - 5411.52] performance then food is not going to do
[5409.72 - 5414.08] it all then of course you will have to
[5411.52 - 5416.08] compensate it with uh supplements like
[5414.08 - 5418.72] creatine glutamine it can be other
[5416.08 - 5420.56] supplements uh as well protein shakes
[5418.72 - 5423.04] but it's there's nothing wrong in it all
[5420.56 - 5424.76] depends on your goal can creatin improve
[5423.04 - 5427.32] your workout performance
[5424.76 - 5429.32] absolutely it is the most researched uh
[5427.32 - 5432.04] supplement on the planet and the most
[5429.32 - 5433.88] proven supplement on the planet but once
[5432.04 - 5436.88] again we saw a very interesting video
[5433.88 - 5438.92] which said that uh they did a they did a
[5436.88 - 5440.80] uh controlled experiment between two
[5438.92 - 5442.64] groups who they gave creating one and
[5440.80 - 5443.84] they did not give to the other one but
[5442.64 - 5446.04] they didn't tell the other one they were
[5443.84 - 5447.60] not giving them they told them as well
[5446.04 - 5450.12] that we're giving you so somewhere the
[5447.60 - 5452.48] power of belief the fact that they were
[5450.12 - 5455.16] getting the creatine actually showed the
[5452.48 - 5456.44] same results then actually more results
[5455.16 - 5459.44] than the group that was getting the
[5456.44 - 5461.60] creative it was somewhere uh on a higher
[5459.44 - 5463.84] side this reminds me of the milkshake
[5461.60 - 5464.72] study milkshake study where people
[5463.84 - 5466.04] thought that they were getting an
[5464.72 - 5468.08] unhealthy milkshake but they got a
[5466.04 - 5470.28] healthy milkshake and the inflammatory
[5468.08 - 5472.44] markers were actually normal when the
[5470.28 - 5474.12] people got the bad milkshake so that is
[5472.44 - 5477.68] the power of
[5474.12 - 5480.32] mind so is caffeine the most effective
[5477.68 - 5482.92] pre-workout supplement for some people
[5480.32 - 5484.80] yes because I mean it has its natural uh
[5482.92 - 5487.52] it does its it does what it does in the
[5484.80 - 5490.56] body by increasing adrenaline increasing
[5487.52 - 5492.80] your uh you know Drive kind of U
[5490.56 - 5496.28] chemicals your hormones so somewhere it
[5492.80 - 5499.40] does make you a little bit edgy and
[5496.28 - 5501.36] but like for me it doesn't work for me
[5499.40 - 5504.08] pre pre-workout supplements don't work I
[5501.36 - 5505.96] usually tell people go to the gym start
[5504.08 - 5508.24] your warmup and I promise you within the
[5505.96 - 5510.84] next 5 minutes you'll be all geared up
[5508.24 - 5512.44] to go I've seen that myself personally I
[5510.84 - 5514.24] hit the gym around 4:30 in the evening
[5512.44 - 5516.60] I'm all like mentally exhausted and
[5514.24 - 5518.12] everything and it just get in the first
[5516.60 - 5520.96] 10 minutes and then the brain just wakes
[5518.12 - 5522.92] up absolutely and I one more amazing
[5520.96 - 5525.28] hack for that is there are days when you
[5522.92 - 5527.08] don't really feel like training choose
[5525.28 - 5530.36] any three or four exercises that you
[5527.08 - 5534.52] love what are those uh so personally I
[5530.36 - 5536.44] love doing back and shoulders so uh I
[5534.52 - 5539.12] will choose maybe two back exercises
[5536.44 - 5540.92] like a seated row um you know like a
[5539.12 - 5542.44] reverse fly and for shoulders I'll
[5540.92 - 5545.80] probably do side raises on the cable
[5542.44 - 5547.92] something very light but engaging and
[5545.80 - 5550.16] I'm not kidding within the next 5
[5547.92 - 5552.16] minutes or two sets into that I'm ready
[5550.16 - 5556.20] for the full-on
[5552.16 - 5559.40] workout if India got a chance to work
[5556.20 - 5561.60] out with you today but they said we can
[5559.40 - 5565.04] only do three workouts this week and
[5561.60 - 5567.48] only one hour each day correct how would
[5565.04 - 5570.44] you construct that workout very simple
[5567.48 - 5572.72] first day we' do a push split second day
[5570.44 - 5574.96] we would do a pull split and third day
[5572.72 - 5576.32] we' do a lower body spit split that'd be
[5574.96 - 5577.92] a little bit of weight training that'd
[5576.32 - 5580.40] be a little bit of functional and a
[5577.92 - 5582.60] little bit of core in all of them is
[5580.40 - 5584.88] there a place I can find this workout
[5582.60 - 5586.52] yes online you can definitely find it so

[5591.32 - 5597.48] this 3-day workout get started
[5594.04 - 5598.76] India few more questions and these are
[5597.48 - 5603.00] for
[5598.76 - 5605.36] vinda can journaling or writing down
[5603.00 - 5607.36] improve your mental well-being
[5605.36 - 5610.76] absolutely because understand whatever
[5607.36 - 5612.84] you're thinking it is energy so it has
[5610.76 - 5614.68] to leave your body it has to come out
[5612.84 - 5616.84] but I take journaling in a little
[5614.68 - 5618.96] different way uh when you're writing
[5616.84 - 5621.56] something negative you had a negative
[5618.96 - 5623.80] experience it has to come out but I
[5621.56 - 5625.08] suggest don't keep it with you so I have
[5623.80 - 5628.76] a very interesting technique which I
[5625.08 - 5631.36] call WTF mhm so it's not what you're
[5628.76 - 5634.48] thinking it is right tear and
[5631.36 - 5637.16] flush what right tear
[5634.48 - 5640.32] yes so whenever so I use this technique
[5637.16 - 5642.20] for U helping people let go of the past
[5640.32 - 5643.88] some painful experience whether it
[5642.20 - 5645.72] happened yesterday or two days ago you
[5643.88 - 5647.80] write it but don't leave it there it's
[5645.72 - 5649.08] energy tear it and flush it but get it
[5647.80 - 5651.40] out of your system so writing really
[5649.08 - 5653.92] helps don't forget to use toilet paper
[5651.40 - 5656.68] when writing
[5653.92 - 5658.96] that or you shred it in tiny tiny tiny
[5656.68 - 5661.12] bits and it gets flushed as well is
[5658.96 - 5664.20] therapy necessary for
[5661.12 - 5666.24] everyone I would say only only to the
[5664.20 - 5668.52] level that you don't understand yourself
[5666.24 - 5671.68] you just need a therapist therap for the
[5668.52 - 5674.32] lack of a better word I would say a
[5671.68 - 5676.68] coach just like you need a fitness coach
[5674.32 - 5679.96] you need a coach to help you understand
[5676.68 - 5682.52] your mental emotional body so for that
[5679.96 - 5684.24] you will definitely need help because
[5682.52 - 5686.20] that is that is the territory which
[5684.24 - 5688.12] youve not explored before in even
[5686.20 - 5689.92] kindergarten you need a coach you need a
[5688.12 - 5691.52] teacher so when you're talking about
[5689.92 - 5694.12] something as deep as the mind you feel
[5691.52 - 5695.64] you don't need a coach everybody needs a
[5694.12 - 5697.36] coach and then learn the techniques and
[5695.64 - 5699.20] then take the journey on from there I
[5697.36 - 5701.68] think ancient indias always had coaches
[5699.20 - 5704.32] they were called gurus yes in everything
[5701.68 - 5706.92] because we had gurukuls we had gurukuls
[5704.32 - 5709.12] so children would taught not just a way
[5706.92 - 5712.12] of earning a living in schools they
[5709.12 - 5714.36] would taught life skills which is my
[5712.12 - 5716.76] intention so this is what the I'm
[5714.36 - 5719.28] working a lot with the youth and uh it's
[5716.76 - 5721.60] my mission so 5 million people in the
[5719.28 - 5723.28] next 5 years I've already said it out
[5721.60 - 5726.00] loud so universe is going to make it
[5723.28 - 5728.92] happen so going to empower them so if
[5726.00 - 5730.96] somebody wants to empower themselves and
[5728.92 - 5733.48] do mind coaching with you how do we
[5730.96 - 5735.52] reach out to you they're online so yes
[5733.48 - 5738.12] please you put the description getting
[5735.52 - 5740.12] the description link for you for mind
[5738.12 - 5741.56] coaching with brinda an important
[5740.12 - 5743.64] question which I see a lot of children
[5741.56 - 5746.28] under stress or even adults under stress
[5743.64 - 5748.40] including in my own team we do so much
[5746.28 - 5751.72] of diet counseling calling up clients
[5748.40 - 5754.56] and I think people stop short of a panic
[5751.72 - 5757.72] attack right so can can breathing
[5754.56 - 5759.32] exercises help manage going in that
[5757.72 - 5762.52] direction to get a panic attack or
[5759.32 - 5764.36] prevent a panic attack 100% Ryan but
[5762.52 - 5767.08] don't wait for the panic attack to
[5764.36 - 5770.20] happen and panic attack does not happen
[5767.08 - 5772.80] suddenly there is a buildup to it so I
[5770.20 - 5774.84] make people more aware of when their
[5772.80 - 5777.32] energies are getting more stressed out
[5774.84 - 5779.72] and when anxiety is just starting out so
[5777.32 - 5781.68] at that part itself you apply the
[5779.72 - 5784.16] practices and the breath work and there
[5781.68 - 5786.44] are certain I call it 321 flip technique
[5784.16 - 5789.48] where you learn how to flip a thought 3
[5786.44 - 5791.24] 2 1 flip technique and which Mahari
[5789.48 - 5793.24] patanjali actually called it praka
[5791.24 - 5795.32] bavana can you imagine thousands of
[5793.24 - 5798.92] years ago they have spoken about the
[5795.32 - 5801.48] mind in such detail and gave the
[5798.92 - 5803.64] importance that this has to be done it
[5801.48 - 5806.00] has to be done otherwise a panic attack
[5803.64 - 5807.76] is just waiting to happen so you apply
[5806.00 - 5809.72] the flip technique and you do the breath
[5807.76 - 5811.52] work and yes in all probability the
[5809.72 - 5814.88] panic attack is not going to get
[5811.52 - 5817.16] full-blown out of control Shivam if not
[5814.88 - 5820.44] a fitness trainer in another life what
[5817.16 - 5822.12] would you be I've never thought of that
[5820.44 - 5824.44] I mean in this life I wanted to be a lot
[5822.12 - 5828.16] of things
[5824.44 - 5832.12] but wow a question that nobody asked me
[5828.16 - 5834.56] honestly I'd probably be I would love
[5832.12 - 5836.08] to be just meditating somewhere in the
[5834.56 - 5839.52] mountains
[5836.08 - 5841.08] rinda oh that this life or next life if
[5839.52 - 5844.00] you had a chance to go back in a time
[5841.08 - 5848.00] capsule what would you want to do
[5844.00 - 5851.08] meditating on my Shiva with my Shiva as
[5848.00 - 5852.20] well so yeah I'm so glad that we align
[5851.08 - 5854.52] on this answer and we never actually
[5852.20 - 5855.80] thought about this before this no I keep
[5854.52 - 5858.48] saying I said if in the next life I'm
[5855.80 - 5860.36] able to come back then at least uh I
[5858.48 - 5863.16] pray to God that bring me into a
[5860.36 - 5866.36] environment which is conducive to take
[5863.16 - 5868.40] God's name from even earlier even ear
[5866.36 - 5870.88] that is something I always ask for not
[5868.40 - 5873.84] just his name just sadas so I think the
[5870.88 - 5877.48] mind and spirituality both connect and I
[5873.84 - 5879.36] think the modern day world is
[5877.48 - 5881.84] disconnected yeah from bringing those
[5879.36 - 5884.08] two together it's been great me you
[5881.84 - 5885.92] today three are together body mind and
[5884.08 - 5887.32] the spirit yeah the body is something
[5885.92 - 5889.48] that all three of us have to work on
[5887.32 - 5891.12] with everyone but I think the spirit is
[5889.48 - 5894.16] also something that comes in from the
[5891.12 - 5896.20] universe absolutely it is the universe
[5894.16 - 5899.12] and we are the tiny aspect of that
[5896.20 - 5902.08] Universe May the force be with
[5899.12 - 5904.60] you and with that May the force be with
[5902.08 - 5906.48] both of you India's most powerful couple
[5904.60 - 5908.48] that I have met for the first time thank
[5906.48 - 5912.12] you it's been a pleasure to host both of
[5908.48 - 5914.68] you and any final words of wisdom to
[5912.12 - 5916.44] India there's no replacement for hard
[5914.68 - 5919.60] work so just
[5916.44 - 5921.60] uh get your mind in order and it will
[5919.60 - 5924.88] just everything else will just happen it
[5921.60 - 5928.24] will flow grinda literally just take
[5924.88 - 5930.96] charge of your mind space and just get
[5928.24 - 5935.44] up and do it
[5930.96 - 5935.44] mentally genuinely physically
[5937.36 - 5942.04] this has been an amazing podcast one of
[5939.20 - 5944.08] the few podcasts which my media team and
[5942.04 - 5945.92] I were shocked to find out that we
[5944.08 - 5947.20] actually did the Law of Attraction the
[5945.92 - 5950.20] power of the mind and actually
[5947.20 - 5952.20] manifested it and 20 minutes later we
[5950.20 - 5953.32] were both communicating with each other
[5952.20 - 5956.16] so this has been one of those
[5953.32 - 5959.48] heartwarming very special close to the
[5956.16 - 5961.72] soul very spiritual and I hope you can
[5959.48 - 5964.36] take away a few takeaways that will help
