getting 9 hours of sleep oh how many of you getting 10 hours of sleep so now the most important component for you to become the verat kohi most important component for you keep your hands down now okay is for you to get enough of sleep now you might have said Nish sir is called me over here all Cricket coaches are sitting in front this fellow is nutritionist why he's talking about sleep man why he's talking about sleep boss you can not eat for 2 three hours and go and play a cricket match but can you bat and bow if you don't sleep the previous night so I will share one story with you okay I have a friend by the way all these guys are my all of these guys are my clients so I've done half of the Indian cricket team right so they pay me money like boss tell me what fruit I should eat tell me what vegetable should I eat tell me how much rice I should eat tell me how to get sixpack uh tell me how to get nice looking teeth tell me how to sleep 10 hours okay so I I'll share a story with you um there is this uh like this is gopalan University right gopalan college in America there was a college called what was the name of the college I think it was Stanford okay so they did a basketball study everyone knows basketball you know basketball no know other sports also not only Cricket so basketball they told them stand at one place and you guys know what is three-pointer yes so they told them to shoot a three-pointer now what they did is they told one group of the basketball players hey boss you all sleep 8 hours a day they told this other group hey boss you sleep 10 hours a day then they took all of these basketball players and they told told them to shoot three-pointers guess which group was shooting more three-pointers 10 hours do you know by how much percentage 99.3% more scoring on 10 hours of sleep so sir G when these children go for tournament they're batting over there first slip caught why because the brain is sleep deprived sir I slept 7 hours of sleep right but if your boys are not getting enough sleep now parents will argue with the coaches sir tomorrow studies he has to study 6 hours of study morning studying afternoon studying evening studying what will you do 6 hours of sleep then you have to study also so your job is to watch less TV don't study less study more but watch less TV instead of spending half an hour in the bathroom spend 10 minutes in the bathroom 20 minutes sleep everyone's getting they all smiling some of you are like 45 minutes in the bathroom also I know when coach travel they Bing on the door come on out we have to go for the match so please remember one thing today I'm going to share with you some of the secrets that I work with players now honestly speaking I don't need to come and meet you guys I can sit in my air conditioning cabinet in and I can call all of you there but this gentleman is a close friend of mine and he says please can you come and talk to the parents and can you talk to the children so I'm talking to the children to tell you if you are a Ferrari if you are a Mercedes-Benz if you are a Bugatti if you are a Lamborghini don't put Katara fuel inside of you so what all you pandus do you'll go to the local cafe outside you'll put five star in your body huh you'll put Samosa Bata you're not thinking what fuel should I put in oh pad leg pad bat all high and Mercedes but inside your body you're doing all KRA so I'm here to tell you you will buy the best of equipment it doesn't make you the best player in the world what makes you the best player in the world is your thinking your thinking gives you your behavior to sleep your thinking gives you your behavior to train and your thinking gives you your behavior to choose your food so don't be gadala athletes you know the meaning of gadada right for those of you non-hindi speakers gadada means donkey huh so don't be donkey athlete and sleep 5 hours eat Samosa Bata chai and go for practice and think about Netflix so if you want to become a great athlete today I'm going to talk to you about small small things so I worked with verat kohi I worked with verat kohi on his diet one of the most disciplined athletes in any sport I've ever met so when I told him once you need to have 100 G of WS he actually measured 100 G of WS he didn't measure 104 gr 100 G I'm sharing with you because Excellence doesn't come in cricket Excellence comes in your thinking first how many of you want to play for India right okay keep your hands down all of you want to play for India what are you doing different than all the other 1 million other boys out there what are you doing different than the other boys out there it starts with your thinking it starts with your thinking so if you want to be a Bugatti Veron if you want to be a Mercedes if you want to be an Audi if you want to be a Range Rover as a human body you can't drive like an auto R shop you can't think like an auto shop then you will be Auto R shop so please Focus I like the fact that you guys have bought books superb you want to take down notes you just need to remember one thing think on my presentation today what is that one thing I am the best in the world start thinking from here now behave as if you're the best so parents you need to call out your children so this part is for the parents the problem with Indian parents and I'm a parent is we get the best of equipment the best of coaches the best of turf best of everything but isaach child mentally tough enough to be the best because we give them the best of everything right my son is 11 years old he doesn't know how to operate the washing machine but the auto washing machine is automatic see you and I when we were born please remember we didn't have washing machine washing machines came after 1990 so all of us who are kids our parents taught us how to wash our clothes this generation put it in the washing machine press the button I will share an incident with you a kid went for a camp in Australia from India father Works in a billion dollar company he calls up his mom and is asking Ma how to operate washing machine 17y old what is the problem with us we don't teach our children to be ready for life so first start with mental grit don't give them everything make them learn and question them because it's very easy to say I want to play for India but when you're eating like a donkey you never play for India I'm sorry I'm calling you a donkey but I'm assuming most of you are very smart but if all of us were smart then everyone would be scoring a century every day so start focusing on your mental discipline okay so we talked about this training that's your department get the guy keep punching him okay parents let the coaches push your athlete let me tell you why I work with some of the top Olympic level athletes in the country so I work with Olympic guys and everybody else is Sada don't let your child get easy stuff let the coaches push them is very very important that's going to happen to them maximum what will happen they'll break a hand no medical Technologies they go repair the hand they have to push they'll get cramps give them electrolyte solution they get a headache give them a doo that things going to happen to our children but if you don't push them when they young they're not going to become Champions so whoever plays for IND has been pushed very hard you assume that you have sent your kids to the best Training Academy so they will become a verat kohi they won't become a verat kohi because of the best Training Academy they will become a Virat kohi because they have the mindset to become it so keep this in mind sleep and nutrition I talked about it you sleep lesser than 9 hours that's your problem you won't have mental focus now comes my department what's my department nutrition so we're going to talk a little bit about nut Nan what's my height can anyone tell me my height huh 6 ft 52 hey 510 I'm 185 CM that is basically 6 feet and a quarter of an inch okay what do you think is the ideal height in cricket between 58 and 6 ft above 6 ft if you grow as a bowler it's amazing because you're launching the ball so are you 51 510 okay put your hand up are you sure you're 510 how old are you uh 14 he's going to be he's going to be about 64 at least this boy is going to grow to 6'4 look at his hand put your hand where is a where's the ball being released up here now do me a favor don't stand on top of this don't touch the fan don't touch the fan okay yeah okay now just a little bit okay now see where my hand is put your hand slightly up up up okay it won't touch now which which guy releasing the ball will have a better dip him right so you want to be shorter or you want to be taller okay come good enough thank you so apples don't increase height huh by the way but apples are very good for potty another thing is when you'll buy apples as a team U there's a lot of wax coating on it so if you're buying organic for your kids and there's no wax coating they can bite it but because these are imported they have a wax coating so you have to peel the skin but if they eat the skin like that nothing will happen so everyone I want to grow taller how do you grow taller now I will share a story with you okay this part of the room is growth huh which part what is this growth this part of the room is performance you understand the meaning of performance what is performance ability to replicate something and make it better so if you're if you're running at 10 km an hour performance means you can run at 12 km per hour okay if you can do 15 push-ups more performance spe you can do 20 push-ups everyone underst performance okay I am nutrition I enter the human body okay I need your help again okay so both of us are nutrition we enter the human body now let's say today we decide we are entering the human body both of us are nutrition uh today what's happened is I didn't eat very good food okay so you stay here only one nutrition comes in Now growth says what is this side growth is saying bus boss please come to us we have to grow taller before the age of 16 now performance is saying by today I did four hours of cricket what will happen I will come to this side and I will sit down I will give performance who's cutting With Me Now growth growth is now cutting boss you didn't come now suppose I eat well okay so today you have played Cricket 4 hours growth also has to happen so what happens you go in you go for performance sit down over there so performance is Happy recovery is there you got nutrition some little leftover nutrition goes for growth so those of you who are not eating correctly are shorter because growth is cuty with you everyone's understanding understood so you need to eat good now thank you what's your name Arjun Arjun so Arjun Arjun is banana Ryan Fernando kurkur chips I say same color kurur color okay Masala color orange color now Arjun comes into the body and kurkur comes into the body which will give you more performance banana comes in the human body Kur comes in the human body which will give you more growth banana Ryan comes into your body Arjun comes into your body who will give more growth Arjun because he a banana because he a banana go sit down are you getting the story guys parents say getting the story what I need you to understand is till the age of 16 you really need to scientifically feed your kid correctly because we Indians are short you can maximize the growth potential of mother and father if you feed your child a little better I don't mean make your child gundu I mean Feed Your Child Nutrition now the problem is all these smart kids my 10-year-old says Papa you know nothing I'm sure your kid says the same thing to you also huh most of you are shaking the head so youth guys think when you all came out of the womb of your mother only you all knew everything Wikipedia download Google download you know everything in life so please go online and type up which are the height boosting Foods huh you can do that today which are the high protein foods why do we need protein huh H muscles okay you need protein for muscle to develop more tissues do cricketers need muscle obviously correct look at the IPL that guy sits that pink one shot like what forearm strength you require to execute that shot yes timing is also required okay who do you think is the strongest IPL player currently huh Russ who's hit the highest sixer longest sixer huh Chris Gale he hit the longest sixer what's his height what's your height 510 how old are you 18 so I made it in very innocent fun so for the younger guys probably if you met me when 12 and I said yeah protein banana you eat it correctly no Kur huh no late nights You' probably get 2 Ines more right now don't go home and start crying okay but 510 is about a perfect height as a batsman so I'm telling everyone over here you need protein so Google up which is the high protein can you tell

washing to the team do you know this story you read the story so apparently Cal is spread by shaking hands and door knobs that's why I did that when I shook sir's hand I was getting I was scared of getting a cold so what they taught the British Olympic cycling team was to wash their hands and by washing their hands the correct way because he was a surgeon surgery the surgeons wash their hands properly so you won't get an infection so they taught the players the number of coughs and coals went down by half in the team you see when you get a cold how many days you have a cold five to eight days five to seven days one week if you are an international Superstar playing the [Music] IPL understand so keeping good hygiene washing your hands and all you boys and any of the girls who are going to become players by the way I work with the women's cricket team also please have a bar twice a day and parents if your kids can have cold water shower even better if you can have a cold water shower even better in this part of the world if you're staying in Kashmir then you give me a call I'll tell you whether to have or not to have okay so are you getting what I'm trying to communicate your body is the most expensive asset so how many times a day will you sleep huh one time one time I sleep two times afternoon also I sleep for little today because of you guys I didn't get my sleep only so now all of you have to give me Pisa to go to sleep okay one one rup everyone has to give me huh sir today I'm not leaving without one rupe one rupe exactly one rupe I want I challenge you to get one rupee today today one rupee is not available also we can't find that imagine if I asked them remember our time 20 Pisa we could we could get all that five ice cream fruits and all parents by the way I'm 48 years of age so I'm from the old school generation how many times a day do you train once a day sometimes if you can do morning and year two times how many times a day you party once twice once twice how many times a day you shower twice good huh twice how many times a day should you eat so a player will eat 5 6 7 10 12 times a day so which is the most important sleeping training or eating eating so please understand what you put into your body number of times it's like going for batting session you may do one batting session but if you do 15 batting sessions you start getting better and better so I ask all of you if you're eating the most number of times should not your food H problem I face with all athletes is dehydration problem okay everyone agrees with me water is 7 60 70% of the body that's what my slide says no how much is the brain 75% what's the next one blood blood 83% water okay 83% water now imagine imagine I am going for a match I'm standing in the ground I'm already sweating can you see that I'm already sweating it's hot I'm not even playing Cricket if I sweating my my sh would be fully wet you also would be sweating okay now imagine blood inside of me how much blood is there in the human body anyone is studied in school no no how much blood is there how many liters of blood any doctor in the audience you will become doctor also and vat kohi super five approximately 5 liters of blood okay five liters blood inside of me how much is water in blood 83% any any Banker over here any Finance person how much is 83% of 5 L I can tell you 4 L Bo my blood is than four lit water now what is happening when I'm standing I'm sweating what am I losing am I losing only salt am I losing water I'm losing salt and water I'm he said salt I'm saying water so everyone let's be clear you're losing water and you're losing salt how do I know you're losing salt taste your sweat how many of you have tasted your sweat I have tasted my sweat huh it is anyone who's not tasting their sweat is not a player because when you're batting over there it right correct and what is the Taste what is the Taste sure are you sure are you sure it's not sweet you're a very sweet boy okay so mama would say oh sweet boy and Mama Ryan came and said I'm very salty boy now please understand I'm losing water and salt so imagine imagine your blood like buttermilk you'll have all seen buttermilk and imagine another glass of lassy okay now I'm putting a straw in the buttermilk now I'm putting a straw in lassi which was more difficult ly now imagine your blood like buttermilk and imagine your blood like lassy which one is more painful inside of you you're losing water where is the water coming from you're losing water you're sweating where is the water coming from blood so your blood is becoming like ly now brain's Bing by by focus focus I was ready sir I was ready sir I was ready sir sir please take me for next match sir sir please next match brain ising brain is telling inside okay Mr Arjun I'm doing an in-depth analysis of your game today now let us analyze your blood has become like lassy you didn't deliver enough of water your brain your brain is 75% of water your brain short circuited on you and you've got the best back best shoes best everything best coach you forgot to drink water man then rinen has like hey wait wait wait wait wait wait who said salts somebody said salts over there you said salts right a is salts sir I drank water where's the salt now parents you will say can I do it naturally sports for children is not natural play is natural what you and I didn't school that is play what these guys are doing is professional sports get that through your thick skull because your brain is 75% water I get parents who children are playing four five hours in the sun sir we will give him only water no Sports supplement no nothing but scientifically the blood is glucose salt which is electrolyte so my son is 10 year old the tennis coach is asking me sir your son is playing for one and a half far all other children are getting tired but he's like you he's one drumstick and then mot M fellow of his friend is coming and he can't even run for 5 minutes it's not because he's M he has more energy his body is getting dehydrated so guys I'd like you to begin to research what is sweat what does it contain and if you're losing water and S if you want to win matches and you're playing 4- day tournaments as soon as these boys finish your tournament Carry Your Wings scale so when you step on a weighing scale so let's say I go for match in the morning my weight is 70 kgs full day I'm playing when I finish the match I'm 68 I lost 2 kgs what did I lose 2 cages of water salt glucose so if I'm not replenishing that in a match then second day match Third Day match fourth day match sir I can't play sir sometime beginning of the match also sir are you getting my picture guys are you getting I want you to understand it's not like diet plan oh I need to go to Ryan Fernando get V start with the basics how many of you have water bottles in here today camera pan to all of them show me your water bottle show me your water bottle this is the water bottle I want I do not want plastic parents by stainless steel now I'm going to analysis open show me steel bottle this is the steel bottle I want let me tell you why this is a vacuum stainless steel now this boy give me a plastic one plastic plastic we will keep both of these in the Sun for two hours how long is a match sir how long is a match six six hours 6 hours huh 6 hours now we'll keep this in a match now we will buy 2 L bottle 2 L plastic 2 L vacuum stainless steel bottle which one will get keep cooler water for me anyone has any objection are we all clear so why are we drinking in plastic okay everybody even I drink in plastic I just wanted a comparison better don't go don't go home and start crying okay last semar I did boy went home crying sir told me I water bottle mother called me up who are you to tell my son not to drink from water bottle and like example so parents it needs to be a vacuum by the way bet this is not vacuum open can you open for me open it forly what will happen is I'll tell you parents and children how will you know it's a vacuum Sports put cold water put cold water ice cold close it and if you put cold water outside will not become cold because the vacuum inside is preventing the cold from escaping also the heat from going inside so if the outside is cold like my my son come Papa check my my sports botle he'll touch it to my head ah it's nice and cold within half an hour room temperature so I want vacuum Sports so guys have you understood this part now next question question how many of you can drink cold water in this room how many of you your throat gives you no problem if you drink cold okay let me ask Ulta question how many of you get throat problem drinking cold water come to me Afters I'll tell you how to do it okay parents please from young age let your Bas bities drink cold water when they go for international thing the cold water goes into the body what is happening when you you're playing sport Body heats up heat how can I cool it water and cooler water goes to my core drops my core temperature my resting heart rate comes down so I am batting drinking garam garam P during water bake heart rate goes up I drink cooler water I have a 2% Advantage 1% Advantage so your water bottle preferably stainless steel is the best byy 2 lit and if you can find a water bottle that has a handle even better very difficult to Source but thumbs up to you if you can do it so I've designed a a sports drink called one Chase because 10 years ago uh I began to think I have a kid and I can't give my kid a commercial Sports Dr so can I design a product for kids so I'm giving all of you samples today you may try it out the idea is to improve hydration in the kids you may ask me is electral good electr is also electrolytes and glucose uh what is a top end bat what is a top end bat huh kabura kabura and what is a average bat huh okay so you understand the difference right average and top end so electrol is average top end would be a sports drink now don't mistake energy drinks with sports drink what is the difference a sport drink has 6 to 8% glucose so for mothers who want to get little bit smart you make a 1 lit solution you will put 60 G of glucose and fructose or maltodextrin to make a 6% solution all your energy drinks or juices are 10% plus that is too much of sugar which will activate the brain to go dealer whereas a 6 to 8% solution is the same concentration as your blood so when it enters the intin says so this is the construct of a sports Dr now let me go forward and I'll take questions today okay from parents and kids a lot of parents ask me protein you need to give three times of carbohydrate to one time of protein Rin very simple sir your kid is here not there okay your kid is here where is he hi what's your name ion huh your birthday happy birthday to you okay see I I I caught the right person okay so Aon do you know your weight he's 64 kgs Papa now I'm putting you on the spot how much protein do you think this boy needs per day no idea I'm going to help you you and I non aete require 1 gam per kg body weight so if you and I are 64 kgs we need to eat 64 gram of protein growing children athletes and pregnant mothers need 1.5 to 1.8 G per kg body weight so now somebody take the calculator very quickly and do 64 into 1.5 about 100 g of protein this young man over 5 meals in the day each meal 20 gram of protein will be what is his requirement so now what I'm doing for my son I'm like okay breakfast I and my my kid is only 30 kgs so it's a little easy for me now right so 30 kgs means I give 50 gram of proteins quite easy if I give him some French dose and two undas got I got 10 15 g of protein there but this boy you'll have to plan 20 to 30 G so he's literally actually daddy eating more than you so you got to figure that out because you're growing you actually need more protein than your dad a vegetarian non-vegetarian non vetan so next time he has a leg of chicken you take it off his plate Ryan Fernando said I need the chicken leg okay happy birthday to you again okay so parents have you understood okay I'm giving a lot of this to you you right okay now imagine I'm Cricket coach sir we will do Cover Drive is this how you play Cover Drive I don't know I'm not a parent of cricket but now I'll go to Wikipedia and Google glub how to do Cover Drive then I will do YouTube video of how to hit a cover drive but dude this is the expert these are the experts why do we have coaching why do we have teachers why do we send our children to school so they can learn I am what you call as nutrition teacher nutrition tutions so I design the plans for players I we also design the plans for children what's the benefit I will tell each one of you what is the benefit of working with a nutritionist you see and for everybody on YouTube also working with a nutritionist with children has a massive impact not only in the current growth but I'll give you an example of one of my children who went to American college so after the first year he came back his mother came and said Ryan sir I spent a lot of money on my child's annual nutrition plan with you but guess what whil all of his friends were boozing and drinking in the American college and eating pizzas and burgers my kid came back stronger with better marks and no alcohol in his body because you've taught the kid how to drive you've taught the kid how to play you've taught the kid how to think youve taught the kid how to eat so and a lot of times like my son goes to his own dietician because there's a saying in Hindi so children don't listen to us parents so don't even try my son will come Baba you know nothing about Minecraft so I've gone and found a Minecraft expert I said can you once a month talk to my son so please do the same for your children find an expert that can help them okay so everyone's understood how much of protein what's your weight huh how many grams of protein you need to eat everybody you got a pen and paper figure out how many grams of protein you need to eat 1.5 G per kg so if you're 37 37 plus half of 37 60 G about 60 g of protein now you got to figure out is it do I eat 60 G in 1 meal or or all the meals you spread it out smart boy the human body 20 to 30 gam of protein more than that does not work parents do you think your children need a protein supplement either do yes or no coaches do you think they need a protein supplement but above a certain age let me tell you something the younger children don't need a protein supplement small frame the only time they need a supplement is when they are fussy eaters or small eaters but otherwise if your child is a good eater because they play so much of sports they need to eat so much of calories the moment they eat more they automatically get their protein so when the child is a voracious eater voracious means a foodie can really eat then thumbs up if your child is a small eater then there is a problem at that time try and figure out a me meal of natural food to be enhanced so like now my son will go and play tennis when he comes back we will grind up CH to make hummus he loves hummus but if I put something else in it it fills him up so what we do is we put hummus and peanut butter and he loves it so 5 tablespoons easily go into him I've got my 10 g of protein post tennis so you can do small small things like this mothers I'll give you the secret Google up please please list all the foods that will give me 10 G of serving in one meal it'll give you a whole list of it start with that this glutamine and BCA are basically amino acids that I give to the international players as a nutritional supplement the above 15 16 you can take glutamine and BCA below 15 you don't really need it top Super foods for cricketers beetroot increases oxygen carrying capacity beetroot increases oxygen caring capacity beetroot is best had 3 hours you can cook it you can bake it you can fry it you can juice it if you don't like beetroot that's absolutely fine how many of you like pineapple over here nice some of you may get kui you don't need to eat pineapple but I will tell you this if your muscles are sore you play like a 4-Hour session eat some pineapple that evening it will reduce your musard on so coach first day they get hammered in the ground they're running running bowling bowling especially your Bowlers especially Bowlers because it's a lot of damage on the body pineapple helps in the recovery so evening when they go back if they're skinny like me a pineapple juice if they're to M let them eat the pineapple as three four rings I talked about hydration I talked about protein okay the one thing that the Indian diet is a little bit low in is omega3 or good fats because the human brain is made of up of 60% fat and 50% of this fat is omega-3 flax seed chia seed Walnut flax seed chia seed Walnut flax seed chia seed Walnut make Walnut Hala make chia seed Hala make chia seed chocolate pudding don't give boring adult stuff to your children okay and and in the non-v department fish there's a I'm from Goa we got a fish called banga in English is called mackel it is the like whoever in the IPL is the best strike rate guy know that is bang for you what it'll come in your body doom doom doom doom hit Omega 3 will go to your brain T full recharge okay so for those of you eat fish mackerel smelly fish your neighbor will know your mom has cooked it for you lots of Bones so you have to sit slowly and take it out if your mother really loves you she'll probably clean it up for you okay so from that perspect okay I'm going to take questions right now okay so if you have questions I'm going to take your questions and then Kish have you given everyone sample I'm really feeling really thirsty can I get a glass of one ches please and I hope it's cold yes it's cold okay thank you no questions yes the first question please ask it loud what what time the children should sleep they have to wake up 7:00 so sir's question is what time should the children sleep if they have to get up at 7:00 :00 one again no we last them no young man you have to get up at 7:00 we discussed the basketball study you remember the basketball study how much improvement was there 9% Improvement in 3.0 so we all want to sleep 10 hours so do 7:00 wake upus 10 hours how much is it huh 9:00 everyone agrees is it possible to sleep at 9:00 no how will he sleep at 9:00 was I didn't invent the clock I am only telling you the scientific study trust me the most thank you bet give me one more glass please the most important see my brain just went because it was cold it went in so you need to understand this huh when cold water touches your Buckle cavity there are all blood vessels here so you you see a lot of players with the helmet they'll turn it on and pour the cold water before you swallow hold the cold water in your mouth for a second so this all the blood vessels here get cooled down send cooler blood to your brain and your brain is like so then when you come back to bat inside the hot helmet sweating sweating sweating at least the brain has got 2 minutes of Rive so sometimes when somebody's on 90 runs got it ire everyone's getting it at that 90 runs if you get that cool break it may help you those who get a s throat with cold water I'll teach you how to take care of your s throat so this is how you drink something that is cold ah get the picture now my brain is cooled down okay so sir have I answered your question they answer your question now it's not possible it's not possible to get 10 hours of sleep is what you're saying okay now 7:00 you have to get up so if you go to sleep at 10:00 how many hours are you getting bet is 9 hours better than 8 hours is 8 hours better than 7 hours try and sleep the best that you can boss you want to stay awake after doni retires he will not sleep at all no problem but as long as doni needs to play cricket you think he's going to sleep any less you think Netflix is going to be his boss you think PlayStation is going to be his boss I am telling you I have worked with the best in the world and I can see it within 15 minutes of the counseling based on Behavior so sir you will see it you will know the verat in this team but we are too shy to tell the parents whose child is not a verat kohi because many of them are lazy in the brain lazy in the brain so parents and children listen in closely it is your parents god-given right to kick your ass it is your parents god-given right to kick your ass for you to become great it's your god-given right because there are millions of parents out there who do what we are doing it's okay he plays so hard it's not okay you want your child to play for the country be tough be tough on your kid I don't mean hit your kid but call them call them out so how I would call my kid tonight my kid wants to sleep at 11:00 IPL matches there you guys want to watch IPL and then you want to get only 6 hours of sleep no sir but if I watch vat B then I will become vat Koh and sleep is by the way do you know that you can watch the match again next morning right your brain cannot be rewound but your Netflix and your IPL can be rebound so food for thought so I would tell my son like this happy birthday son but you know uh today's the IPL match what would you like to do would you like like to watch the match or would you like to get 10 hours of sleep because tomorrow you got a match and your son replies I'd like to watch the match because even with six hours of sleep I can play very well well I thought Ryan said that you know 10 hours they got a three-pointer strategy but you know best you're an adult and it's your life but if I was you I'd get 10 hours of sleep and then lead by example and that's the way we need to bring up our children parents if you lead by example you kids start watching you okay next question that's a long question on sleep next question yes better so this young man's question is are protein powders a good source protein bar is a good source of energy so what you do is the first question you ask is what is the food in the protein bar so mostly it will be whe protein soya protein egg protein green pea protein uh casine protein casine is a paneer protein uh it could be Chana protein it could be peanut protein satu protein the next thing you ask how much of protein in one bar 12 g of protein so they're showing 12 G so 12 G is pretty good right now the next thing you should look for in a protein bar is how much of preservative right so the next question is can I eat this at home why am I taking a protein bar is it because of convenience or is it because of taste mostly it says convenience sir I've gone so far away I can't carry Anda with me for 6 hours it will smell in my bag right so sometimes it's important to see whether the convenience overrides the convenience of eating fresh okay I hope answer your question sir I found a protein bar with 30 g of protein and 10 g of protein which is better more is not necessary less uh is better so it depends on the situation if you do weight training heavy weight training pull-ups push-ups leg press in the gym I would give you more protein Cricket training 12 gram of protein along with something else is pretty good have I answered your question I would prefer you to eat protein from natural sources but if that is not there then the alternative is to have a protein bar okay I do recommend protein bars to my athletes but only after they come to me they do a blood test uh I look at food allergy like for example you'll be like sir I found way protein bar but if I do your genetic test and your blood test and you're allergic to milk so it's very important to realize does that food agree with you so how you can know that if you eat a protein bar do you get gassy do you get stomach pain do you get pimples do you get acne you get heat boils so then that may be not good for you some people get loose motion if I eat a ve protein bar I get loose motions because I'm allergic to milk so I don't eat any ve protein I will have a hemp protein or a casual protein or soy protein B okay any other question there was some few yes ma'am boosting Foods height boosting foods are basically foods which are higher in protein but some of my favorites will be egg okay if you're a vegetarian I definitely would recommend satu or paneer but please note the problem in height is not from the food problem in his height first is father and mother's average height genetics but if the child is eating less examp s00 protein snack goes for Cricket empty tank finish ious Cricket so tired so exhausted we'll eat some junk food body boy I cannot grow so a balanced meal and I can give you an example I had a family who came to me for 6 months we give all the good nutrition protein powder sports drink grow but six years later the boy was the tallest in the family so growth for girls is between 9 and 12 how old are you better huh 18 now you focus on strength you focus on power you focus on your muscle okay are you taller than your mother Al your mother has fed you very well are you as tall as your father no had you come earlier then she could have put night but there is a certain genetic limit my favorites is beetroot for height growth Walnut almonds Pista Walnut almonds Pista Pista has the highest Arginine content arginine is an amino acid which helps in boosting nitric oxide pistas pistachos okay how many depends so we have to calculate the calorie requirement of each High boosting food any other question yes sir very good question boys grow between 14 and 18 boys grow between 14 and 18 some boys if they're lucky between 18 and 21 they will get little bit more height boost make sure boys you do hanging exercises hanging pull-ups all right the longer you can hang that will help in one inch or two Ines eat disciplined drink enough of water and parents please do a blood test for cricket players athletes 95% of all Indian children athletes are vitamin D deficient vitamin D is responsible for bone growth I'm touching my tie because this is one of the longest bones so if you get good vitamin D in your diet it's going to help you how much vam I cannot give the dosage for vitamin D unless we see the blood test the correct way to do it is you can either speak to a medical nutritionist or you can go to your family doctor and ask for the prescription of the dietary supplement next question you'll have can I get any food mushroom and eggs have small quantity of vitamin D but not enough if there is a vitamin D deficiency if there's a vitamin D deficiency your child needs a pediatric supplement of vitamin D L Arginine supplement for them it l arginine is amino acid found in pistachos and green peas mutter do they need an allinine supplement no it is better to take a protein supplement which will contain l Arginine in the protein naturally and the only time I will give L arginine is if they reach the IPL level because I'm constructing it for Vaso dilation so there's extreme lactic acid and I want the blood vessels to dilate to clear out the lactic acid so for the boys if they have done a rot of running and is fully tight eating po baji which is with a lot of green peas or mutter paneer or 10 15 pistachos salted because they sweated a lot can really help you now was sir's question yes sir very good question so sir's question is I want to think of giving protein supplement to my child but all the way all the protein supplements in the market are they safe are they okay is the quality okay most of the proteins supplements are derived from a food source ve protein casine protein soyer protein hem protein green pea protein all of these so they take the food product and extract the protein because they are extracted The Taste is very uh so we need to put a lot of sweetener artificial sweetener which children shouldn't get artificial sweetener so as a pediatric Sports nutritionist what I try to do I try to give natural food if you're not meeting it I will try try and find a protein supplement which does not have artificial flavor I'll ask you one question you read all chocolate chocolate parents now every time you buy something and it says chocolate look whether it says chocolate flavor or real chocolate a product which has real chocolate will be in the thousands of rupees because you know how expensive real chocolate is so are we giving our children chemical flavor or you buy what is called as a naked naked protein supplement no sugar no flavor so for my son I buy a protein supplement it's like a Chana powder I put it into his coconut milk he's allergic to normal cow's milk then I buy cocoa powder put it in I put one teaspoon of sugar Hey sir how can you put sugar boss I put normal natural sugar they are children they have so much of energy they don't need asulam sucros and aspartame they need correct balance sir can I put honey inside of sugar yes can I put Jager yes you and me who are adults we don't need sugar because we're on the verge of getting diabetes so sir if I have to give a protein supplement in a public forum I don't say buy this supplement buy that supplement I kind of see the blood test I look at generators I look at the family background up nonvegetarian here so sir are you nonvegetarian vegetarian so mostly for vegetarian sometime then we don't be that you eat eggs sir if you give eggs then you can meet your protein requirement for a child under 60 kgs above 60 kgs we should teach him to eat a little bit more so he gets it from natural diet how many eggs can be given a day to a 60 kg boy where 64 67 see basically I I would give my kid about three to five eggs a day I would do two whole yolks two whole eggs the remaining will be egg whites but in children the only time I don't give whole eggs is when the family has a history of cholia meaning they have a family Gene of high cholesterol so I don't give that in the younger years so sometimes we do the Olympic Gene testing and they figure that out but for the safe side two whole eggs and maybe three additional egg was five can I give 12 well bodybuilders eat 12 I don't think you're so I would suggest so we have a team of sports nutritionist here in indran nagar I would suggest to parents invest in a 3 months 6 months you don't need to come to me I'm very expensive okay come to my nutritionist and get it done but what happens is when you do it scientifically for your child you're able to get specifics first point second Point your kid doesn't argue with you because the gym trainers told him to take three scoops of way protein see because a Gym trainer has tried it on his body and taking three scoops of protein by the way do you know if it's affecting your brain Focus so I can do a very big conversation on this that when children especially teenage boys start putting more and more protein powder the body has to detox too much of protein and then the ammonia levels are little bit higher so the boy is very uh [Music] uh you need to be like on the field focused you don't need extra protein you need 1.5 G per kg body weight by not eating the correct food and putting three scoops of protein powder that is like saying that is like saying Ryan Fernando who has never even played Cricket for his school takes verat koh's B take Virat kohi pad I'm wearing all of his gear I can hit sixer that is what a protein powder is without the proper training of good Dal chavel Roy and and if you're non-vegetarian nonv I hope I've answered your question any other questions yes sir so very good question so sir's question is hey you want to leave if it's your birthday you got a thumbs up man happy birthday so very good question a very good question about a very very good question about water 60% of the body body is water we buying the most expensive watches most expensive everything but when it comes to drinking water my point is I in my own house I buy a more expensive water which comes from a spring or which comes from the mountain uh and my logic is very very simple if I can afford it I would choose a better quality water is alkaline water good we're looking for water that has natural mineral salts in it so you can buy glacial or spring water you can take Arrow water and put a pinch of Celtic salt or Himalayan pink salt in it now how much to put that I don't know so normally you can just put one crystal in a liter and hopefully that should help you out nowadays you get electrolyte salts which can dissolve in 2 L of water and you can make sure that in drinking 4 lit of day maybe 1 lit or 2 L for sports people is also a electrolyte salt balanced water is alkaline water beneficial the answer is yes I do recommend buying a better quality water for your children or for any players last question for today uh so the question here is in the evening let's say after 6:00 in the evening there's a heavy cardio session heavy plyometric session like lot of running and everything the question is you need to take carbohydrates so coach is saying can I give some dates can I give some um fruit or something before the session starts carbal loading yes should I recommend a BC Arginine above 13 14 years of age um case to case basis a maximum of 2 G of BCA Arginine not recommended and let me tell you why BCA goes to the brain and activates the alertness so as they go to sleep the brain's not going into a deep sleep so all my players not only 13:14 after 5:00 p.m. I advise them not to take a BCA supplement with the chance that it might affect their deep sleep cycle and it is in deep Sleep Cycle we release the S SW as sleep we we release growth hormone and stem cells so maybe when there 17 18 once the growth hormone sport is over then we can take a BCF because it's tenis what can I give they could have an egg during the session simple carbohydrate and electrolytes cold water on the face more deeper breaths and if you want to increase the nitric oxide which is one of the reasons why we give Arginine to Vaso dilate the blood vessel research is now showing nostril breathing increases nitric oxide by a significant double digit level I can't remember it I don't remember if it was 12 or 14 but the answer is in James nestor's book uh called breath on page 22 where he did the cycling experiment and they found that one of the athletes who was mouth breathing with 44 breaths to complete the target did it in only 14 breaths with nose breathing so nose breathing is very very important for the future generation of athletes to figure out a better cardiovascular training very good question is there any age I can go to the gym or is there any restriction there is no restriction going to do any physical workout first of all in the gym you do a physical workout what the leading exercise physiologists in the world have said is children under the age of 16 17 try not to compress the spine or load the spine so like squats or heavy bar on top of your spine but all other activities in the gym which you may do with free body hanging weights or machines is acceptable provided your trainer knows exactly what is the end goal required so if you're going to the gym for overall Fitness your trainer needs to design your plan for that parents don't be afraid to send your children to the gym provided the trainer is really good if it is a housekeeping trainer and a lot of gyms have this housekeeping trainer but 6 months ago he was housekeeping they have to have a certification from some of the leading institutes in the world it's called a snc strengthen conditioning if the person is an snc certified person and don't be afraid to ask your trainer can I see a certificate I had a parent recently said Mr Fernando can I see your certificates absolutely and I was like absolutely you may be vat koh's nutritionist do you know Amir Khan asked me for my certifications so don't be afraid because it's your children you go to a coach ask the coach you go to nutritionist ask the nutrition you go to a doctor outside doctor put know mbbs F frcs MD then reference is there don't be afraid to ask your trainer because sometimes the trainer just has a good body but is not a sports strength and conditioning trainer which might be the worst thing for your child answer your question so it's okay for you to go to the gym provided you got a great trainer and under supervision and don't load your back with heavy exercises so you shrink your SP how tall are you beta 510 59 59 how old are you 14 you'll cross 62 are you taller than your father no then man you'll beat your dad you the dad and you're the wife stand up Aram say 62 if you don't reach 62 come back and sue me okay I'll give you 15 I'll give you 15 oranges for reaching 62 but you got to eat well and you got to sleep 10 hours does you sleep 10 hours now you now you know how to have the equation with him right Ryan said kind of 10 hours kind of and do one thing parents please sit down please sit down do one thing record all of this when he has a girlfriend no show this all back to the girlfriend I'm keeping videos I'm keeping videos of my son dude I'm going to get you how can you how can you work with this more smarter gen there much more smarter than us so we need some blackmail tools so popsy record the videos him getting up at 10:00 in the morning all of that stuff do that you'll remember me when he's 21 years of age guys what you need to do be the best at what you do there are few people who will play for the country how many people can play for the country H 15 15 out of how many billion people 1.3 billion Indians okay male and female 600 600 or 700 700 out of 700 million Indians 15 of you will have a chance to play for India is it you last question to the mom to the he just what are theh okay okay okay so m''s question and everyone listen in close and this is this is a learning for for Coach very few people in the world will tell you this I heard a lady break the Guinness World Record of non-stop aerobics of 26 hours so all I did was to know she's hydrated or dehydrated I would watch her eyes so the eyes also contain water okay when the athlete begins to get dehydrated their blinking goes like this can you see my eyes but if the athlete is not dehydrated coach their blinking is like this one per 3 seconds is my equation this is my this is my realization over two decades as a sports nutritionist it's not there in any book or anything and the moment you see somebody going so this IPL guys watch all your players is batting I know they dehydrated so coach when you see the guy doing like coach how are you coach I'm very fine coach right like P bet have I answered a question and you also need to not give plain water because plain water dehydrates so if they're drinking 5 L of water in a day at least one liter needs to be a sports drink because you're giving glucose and salts because you're losing salts absolutely absolutely there's no problem he can be drinking water as he's running to get 100 runs if I think the future will be like this verat kohi will have one can here one can over here with a helmet the water will be there his be have you seen race car drivers they've got that if I could do that in every sport people would be able to play at the next level but what do you need to do wait for your water break so Cricket is a very demanding sport because you're restricted from taking water and when water really comes blah blah blah blah everyone's talking nobody's hydrating so you need to when the water comes in the Water Boy comes back if everybody's not got the water give one kick to the water boy I I mean in today's world we might be arrested sir you might be arrested I'm saying figuratively okay so ma'am unlike anything else that we were taught in the past yogic gurus and all don't drink water and all sports is different maam right so because the statement I will make to you is you need to learn to play a sport you need to learn to train for a sport right you also need to learn to eat for a sport you also need to learn to eat when playing the sport meaning my stomach should be able to receive dates my stomach should be able to receive one Chase my sports drink my stomach should be able to um maybe get a cup of coffee when I'm playing I have people who do ultra marathon 100 kilometers of running a day sir I can't eat sorry I'm running 100 kilometers you you watch this on the internet they're eating and running and drinking when this so you train the stomach to learn that you can't do it suddenly but slow and steady I hope I've answer the question mic drop oh okay last question to my first boy of the question who answered the diet question correct okay what's your question what are the like energy givings during the session like what do we have during a session what are the energy giving foods during a session quiz for everybody what do you think are the energy giving foods during a session huh brown bread dark chocolate yes but one thing I'll tell you in a session if you take dark chocolate does your mouth become Uka huh so maybe dark chocolate in the form of a chocolate milkshake in a session so you can make a diluted chocolate milkshake and drink it during a session my favorite is dates dates one of my favorite peanut butter put on a piece of brown bread no problem if you're not allergic to gluten anything else casual good casual badam Pista kmas I love kissmiss what is kmas in English raisins Smart Guys yeah so in your Pock in your pocket waiting for the ball to come no and then you start never mind if this becomes milkshake inside over here okay but learn to eat when you play coach allow them small more breaks because it will make your brain more alert in practice but children children players don't abuse the 30second break the coach gives you and make it 3 minutes they have breaks of 5 minutes also okay so that's very good uh there's another reason why you shouldn't take a very long break focus focus focus break brain is like break I've gone now to Kashmir coach is like come back over here brain is like Kashmir so you need to be focused in your training 100% ladies and gentlemen what's my name where can you find me indagar very good and on the internet where can you find me just type up my name Ryan Fernando on Google you'll find me all you type off who's vat koh's nutritionist simple so parents I did the seminar today for my dear friend it's hopefully to convince you that maybe you want to get expert nutrition for your kid don't wait till they become a verat Koh you can do it when they very young trust me parents have come back and told me my son now doesn't fight with me when eating mothers come back and say I don't have to break my head on what to feed this kid anymore because there is a menu plan created for the kids one Chase is given to each one of you this is a solution I personally designed yes I've come here with a commercial interest to give you this and make you try it out as parents you can try this out also but those of you who are on the Mota side you need only salts you don't need the glucose in this so this is ideally not for non sports players this is put one sash is put in 500 mL preferably of cold water in a plastic water bottle or stainless steel bottle stainless steel why stainless steel bottle because it keeps the water I've done my job thank you very much hey guys what are we going to do good s good good I love you [Applause] guys
