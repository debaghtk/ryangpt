Transcript: got my apple cufflinks on and i think it's pomegranate so today's session is all about anybody who wants to make a resolution in 2022 anyone who's wanting to exercise and put on more muscle anyone who wants to exercise and lose fat anyone who's exercising and worried like me at 47 that when i run on the treadmill i'm like okay am i gonna get a heart attack or not and i brought together two experts my first expert coming in is uh dr ashish contractor he's an old friend he's written a book called the heart truth i'm going to get him on board right now and i have shwetambrichetti who is an old friend of mine uh where we did a radio show together and we have continued to work together i do shwathamri's diet every now and then she's recently become a mom and trust me she looks the same when i knew she was a single person fit as ever so let me get both of them in over here i think dr ashley says in over here hey ashish how are you doing very good ryan so happy happy new year to you and to all the listeners and you said sritambri looks the same as when you saw her years ago if you have not seen her earlier she definitely does look young to me but you also look the same so when you said you're 47 that kind of took me by surprise so you're obviously doing something something like yourself yeah i i eat a pomegranate a day so the research was done ashish apparently a pomegranate the seeds of the pomegranate if you bite them and eat them or put them in your old sumit blender releases omega 5 fatty acid which has an anti-aging effect and the pomegranate also releases more nitric oxide which from your perspective as a cardiology exercise specialist this better vasodilation so pomegranate a day will probably keep dr ashish away but talking about dr ashish you've written an amazing book called the heart root and i i think that's why i called you in today because um i recently had a client a very dear client of mine the film star punit rajkumar who passed away because of a heart attack now every one of my clients every one of my friends everyone is like in 2020 and 2021 we saw a lot of people corporate ceos running on treadmills and collapsing of heart attacks and i thought who better than to invite dr ashish who's the race medical director in the mumbai marathon so if any any marathon happens and we are running over there dr ashish is the guy that's saving our life uh hopefully you don't get a heart attack when you run so ashish my first question to you doc is that uh is it okay to exercise in 2022 thanks ryan you know it's it's actually quite quite sad and quite ironic that over the last year because we've had these unfortunate events we are being asked the reverse question normally people should ask or is it bad not to exercise how can i or my loved one exercise and today over the last year year and a half people are asking the question in reverse um so give me a couple of minutes to talk on this subject because it's something which you know you can't have a one liner on and ironically since the last four five months i've done probably ten different podcasts and events such as this around this subject and yours let me distill it down for you exercise is absolutely fabulous if we could put all the benefits of exercise into a pill it would probably be the best selling pill ever okay apart from your heart stroke cancer pretty much every chronic disease known to man exercise reduces your risk of getting it and in god forbid you have got it exercise improves your quality of life and reduces your chance of it becoming worse that's enough in a nutshell okay having said that exercise does not provide immunity against heart attack and death and this is where people make a mistake just because someone is exercising does not mean they cannot have an event since we are talking about the subject of heart there are different risk factors which contribute towards a person having a heart attack okay the usual ones which i'm sure you've spoken about several times in the past smoking diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol heavy weight genetics and last is lack of exercise so obviously if you're exercising you're getting rid of one risk factor but doesn't mean that you cannot have now all these people who unfortunately died young i cannot comment on what their risk factors were because i do not know it but i just want to say that just because you're fit does not mean you have immunity you have protection but not immunity and that's what people need to understand one final point when people who are very well known have an event it also makes disproportionate views in the headline when people are exercising and they have an event it makes disproportional news you rarely read in the newspaper somebody sitting at home watching tv has a heart attack doesn't make the news but if the person was in a gym or outdoor exercising it does make the move so exercise is beneficial so doc you you used a very very important point and i i want to ask the maximum number of questions before i let you go i know you're very busy at the hospital um you said immunity doesn't confirm immunity so ryan fernando wants to work out in 2022. doc i want immunity what are the things that i should test for can i come and visit you at hn reliance hospital and can you get me running on a treadmill what's what what do i need to do in 2022. so you know you're you're most welcome to visit you've been threatening to do that for the last five years but you haven't yet done it but so here's the point i think to start with every adult should know some very basic numbers okay you must know your height and weight i know i'm stating the obvious but there are so many people who don't you must know at least once a year your blood pressure your cholesterol your sugar these are all simple things which can be done with one simple inexpensive blood test and somebody measuring your blood pressure the problem is these are all silent issues all these three big ones blood pressure cholesterol and sugar if your numbers are way high you won't know it until you measure it so if you ask a room full of people do you have you know high cholesterol very few people may put the end up but then if you ask them how many of you have actually measured in the last one year again very few people will put the hand up so you can't assume you've got good cholesterol or sugar or blood pressure until you measure it so if this is the minimum testing you need to do once a year now if any of these numbers come high then yes you need to test further something else i would two more points i would add if somebody has a strong family history of heart disease by that i mean some direct relation mother father brother sister has has died young when i say young say below the age of 60. not just had a heart disease but died young below the age of 60. that would be a sort of a alarm bell in my mind so speak to your doctor he or she may want you to do further tests if you want to embark on vigorous exercise right not just a simple brisk walking program if you want to embark on in vigorous exercise talk to your doctors to see whether additional tests are required or not okay so that's that's that's awesome um most of the people that work with swethambri uh in terms of fitness all of us are in this young age of 40 to 60 and we feel very invincible we're doing this cholesterol test but they'd still go they just do a workout and go down to the pub and then have all that unhealthy food and stuff like that what more should they do because i'm seeing people coming with esr c reactive protein lipoprotein a lipoprotein b all of this is high uh hb a1c is also high uh will meeting a cardiologist as a preventive factor and will maybe screening for genetics uh from that perspective help a client okay so you hit a good point so there are a lot of people who are very fit but they engage in unhealthy behaviors okay so again you may be very fit you may play a great game of tennis or squash or run a quick marathon but you may still be smoking for example so you know you need to take care of your health behavior there's another very well known phrase which you'll identify with which says you cannot outrun a bad diet true so just because you're running mile after mile doesn't mean people say oh he's so thin he's so fit he can eat anything no you cannot eat anything just because you look fine or if you exercise some of the things you mention your lipoprotein small a you know esr c reactive protein a lot of them are markers of what's called inflammation in the body and there are sort of theories that inflammation is the genesis of a lot of heart disease and other diseases as well so yes under the guidance of a good nutritionist a good doctor for the testing would be helpful especially if you have a family history um i don't suggest a specific set of tests which everyone needs to do without talking to the doctor but all the tests you mentioned are for some of the newer risk factors like you mentioned lipoprotein small a homocysteine in the right subset they should be mentioned so i i have questions coming in live because we're going off facebook and linkedin and somebody somebody's asked doc what is the difference between a stroke and a heart attack okay so let me tell you the difference between not only a stroke and a heart attack but also a cardiac arrest and a heart attack that people um get more confused with oh even i don't know the difference between two yeah so stroke first of all the same way a stroke is a brain attack it's very simple when we say heart attack is because there are blockages in the heart arteries and a blockage erupts and that causes a heart attack similarly when you have a problem in the brain the artery either the art there are two types of strokes one is called hemorrhagic when the blood vessel ruptures that's about five to ten percent the other is when there are blockages that's called ischemic which is more common so stroke in simple words is a brain attack okay same way as a heart attack is a brain attack same risk factors blood pressure cholesterol diabetes smoking all the usual suspects let me tell you the difference between a heart attack and a cardiac arrest cardiac arrest as the name suggests is when the heart essentially stops beating or stops functioning so pretty much everyone before they before their final breath so to speak they're in a cardiac arrest now a heart attack is the commonest cause of a cardiac arrest but every heart attack does not lead to a cardiac arrest okay one out of three heart attacks tend to be kill people on the spot and they probably lead to the cardiac arrest at the same time a heart attack is not the only reason for someone having a cardiac arrest let's say you put your hand in a big electrical system and you get electrocuted you will go into cardiac arrest a lot of the deaths that we see in young people now young i would probably draw the line at 25 30 like we saw happen with the danish footballer during the eriksen during the euro and also when recently one indian cricketer just collapsed those are cardiac arrests happening the press wrongly reports them as heart attack those are not because of cholesterol vp etc they are usually because of some abnormality in the structure of the heart often genetic in nature communists are what are called cardiomyopathies or some of the arteries are coming out of a wrong position it's called the anomalous origin of a coronary artery or many of them are unknown where the heart suddenly goes into what's called an arrhythmia an abnormal heart trigger so those lead directly to a heart attack sorry a cardiac arrest without a heart attack okay so so doc if somebody has like you said no family member or something or maybe they've done a genetic test and they figured out that they have the cardiomyopathy gene or the atrial fibrillation gene or these things that are being identified in today's world when they come and meet you what is what is it that you are looking for in such people and then what is the advice that you're giving them in terms of you know i think the biggest factor today is fear because we have all of this knowledge to test but then i think people bring upon the disease upon them by just manifesting a negative event so how do how do you comfort people how do you type you know in most of so let's first talk about the standard if i use the word standard heart disease which is the blockage you know the stuff that we most talk about technically called coronary artery disease that always benefits with exercise how much exercise at the right time is of course what we discuss with the client or with the patient now when you're talking about some of these cardiomyopathies um there are some if if we see that in in in the patient in the client rarely do we have to tell them to stop exercise we often need to tell them that they will have to stop competitive exercise at a at the highest level if they've got these cardiomyopathies but usually uh most can do regular recreational exercise so that's when the expertise comes in to decide who should do everything normally without any stock who should exercise recreationally but not competitively and which is that very small subset which should not do anything at all until further workout happens you know i'm smiling doc because i think the film stars go into a very competitive mode when they want to morph their body and they really aggressively push the body and then there's the diet which is restrictive and then you have various trainers or people giving advice don't drink water you know cut out on sodium so that your skin looks better for the movie shoot and i think this influences the rest of the population so you the point i think that i should rephrase is that check with a doctor on the intensity that you should work out at competitive or recreational fitness and to ask you another question would an exercise variable that tracks your heart rate help uh people work out in the correct heart training zone which puts lesser stress on the heart i i think so i think today variables have have really changed the face of the way we measure the way we quantify the human cell they need to be used sensibly now there are people who also then get drowned in data and get grounded numbers so that's the little care you need to take um that actually a fabulous company coincidentally based right out of your bank law called fox frontier and i've been using their devices they've got a heart rate strap called the frontier x which actually not only transmits the heart rate but it also transmits the ecg this is the first of its kind pretty much that i've seen in the world and i've been looking for years and years which transmits a live ecg and a very good quality ecg in the past whichever things that work with the ecg hasn't been that great so if you've got a specific heart condition then exercising with a device like this which measures the ecg is fantastic if you don't have a heart condition and you want to use heart rate training just to be more scientific than any wrist worn device or you know there are several today available and most have a reasonable degree of accuracy can be used the data needs to be used intelligently you need you need a right coach or right guidance as to what your heart rate guidelines should be and and you've got also just make sure that you don't get drowned in data often people get drowned in data and they forget the actual thing you just go out and do something wait for that perfect workout the perfect diet and in between they don't do anything so that that is a problem speaking of not doing anything i got one or two more questions before i let you go i know you have a busy day take your time what prompted you to write this book the heart truth and i'm going to put the link up for people to buy because when i read that book it gave me an eye opener uh because i did my genetic testing and i've got like 60 of the indians according to the gene lab 60 of the indians have the predisposition to heart disease yeah so um i i was reading your book and you talked about the perfect weight is important if you look at a person and i'm being very cheeky over here you must be seeing thousands of patients right so somebody comes in and just looking at i think this guy is a probable heart attack person ah looks deceiving like you see a fat man with a visceral fat belly uh what's your experience from an eye perspective to catch a person or you're at a party i invite you to my next year's newer party and we have 500 people over there and ash's contract because heart attack no heart attack heart attack no harder is it possible that way okay so you're asking two separate questions i'll answer them one after the other in terms of you know can you judge a book by its cover in my practice i've learned that you can often be wrong we gen we normally go by this thing that thing is fit and fat is unfit which is not true of course if you took a room of 100 people and you divided them by pmi usually the ones who have the healthy bmi will as a group be healthier than the ones who are an unhealthy bmi but there's a huge variation within that range i have found that there are a lot of people who overweight i'm not talking about completely obese say bmi 25 to 13 that zone but who exercise regularly they are metabolically fit their sugars their cholesterol all their numbers are in great order it's just that they're carrying a few extra kilos they're trying their best they're even maybe eating healthy but but you know what they're still walking around with some weight and then there are people who look very thin but just because they're thin doesn't mean that their numbers are perfectly in order so i i may not know just by looking at them but by maybe observing them for half an hour and looking at their plate i might get a little more inkling but but i've been horribly wrong several times so i don't even want to go there swathambri do you have any questions for doctor well i think the question that i've been getting in the recent past owing to all those incidents of heart attacks uh doctor is really about over training and i just quickly wanted to uh you know ask you this question you know how what is overtraining in a sense we say that you should work out anything between 30 to you know 50 minutes max an hour a day and then be active through the day and not just you know be sitting around but i've seen a lot of the ones like between the age of 30 and 40 or 25 to 35 sometimes do like two hours three hours of rigorous training and i think at a slightly younger age you may not feel the burnout as much but do can i relate that to uh eventually not being good for the heart okay so you asked asked a great question uh let me quickly answer ryan's earlier question what prompted me to write the book so in my in my cardiac rehab practice we used to see you know i must have seen over over 10 000 people come and go and i decided that a lot of people they have hundreds of questions but the questions tend to be very similar so i wrote the book in a very colloquial fashion these are my experiences of dealing with my patients and they usually have the same questions so i'll try to in a conversational style address about four five hundred of the communist questions that that they've had over time and i found that that was very useful so now when people come and i say if you like you can read the book that will answer a lot of the questions um that you have and it was i promised myself before i turn 40 i will write a book so that's uh that was the reason for the book and i'll run a sub 145 half marathon so both those promises have been kept and that was exactly 10 years ago um to answer sritambri's question okay this question of over exercising and over training is a great question let's look at it in two ways we can do what's called acute or chronic acute means over exercising like in a single session right a session of last three hours how much you go right that's a immediate acute overtrain the second is chronic chronic meaning over months over years someone who's running 100 kilometers plus week after week for you know many years um someone who trains in the gym two hours a day for you know week after week year after year um so if someone builds up them builds themselves up sensibly right starting with the very standard 30 to 60 minutes moderate intensity exercise four five days a week um and you keep building up rule of thumb is not doing more than 10 increment over your previous week if you do that over time a person the human body is capable of great achievement okay i used to once growing up think that oh my god 42 kilometers is impossible for the last now seven years i've been doing one full marathon every year but the human body can build it up so that isn't a problem but if i wake up a lot of people are the weekend warriors they're not doing much and then suddenly on a sunday they decide today we'll go and write for four hours today we will you know run for two hours that is a problem okay so when you push yourself so over training is pushing an unprepared body for the task at hand that's very important there are two people somebody may run one and a half hours and that may be over training because that person's never run more than half an hour before in their life or someone may run four hours but they've been doing between three and three and a half hours for the last six months so for that person that four hour run wasn't over training to the position they had built themselves up with but the guy who ran one and a half hours was used to half an hour over training why the guy who ran 45 minutes when he's never run before is over training okay so acute over training has got to be seen in light of the conditioning of the person okay that's important chronic over training this is where it gets interesting is there something like too much over time so earlier the answer was there really isn't too much what they've now discovered that people who are putting in large volumes of endurance training over many years they sometimes tend to have higher amounts of what's called atrial fibrillation they sometimes have a little more scarring on the heart muscle having said that we've still not figured that is that more dangerous in any way so the jury is out there that is there something like the ill effects of chronic over training number one and if there is what's the magic plan now please let me emphasize these are people who have been doing like on an average 40 50 70 full marathons ultra marathon so by no means the average person that you and i see in our practice so there's no need for people to panic but there is off late last five seven years scientific light looking at this okay so that question is under study as of now we haven't defined that sure thanks doc sorry uh here there's a question from a person watching us mr patel asking with relationship to triglycerides even after a safe diet no outside food and exercise still my triglycerides visceral fat levels often shoot up what may be the reason okay so um you know the diet part i'll leave to you but just one quick point just because you don't eat outside food that doesn't necessarily mean that you're treating healthy food right the average indian diet especially the vegetarian diet tends to be very high in carbohydrate uh and i'm not an anti-carb person like the fad is today but the point is the average indian diet tends to be very high in simple sugars just a lot of rice bread chapatis in the diet as opposed to vegetables so though you know the person may be vegetarian the amount of vegetables which is great for you is not eaten in large quantities in my experience indians tend to have high triglycerides and low hdl along with that visceral fat is that classic insulin resistance syndrome metabolic syndrome syndrome x which i'm sure you're very familiar with um i have found that reducing the simple carbohydrates simple sugars in the diet definitely helps um exercise helps reducing visceral fat and triglycerides i think i think if you're consistent over time you will definitely get benefits uh in reducing triangular strides with a little bit of weight loss regular not just exercise as the doubly said also including physical activity is part of your daily life okay there are people who go to the gym one hour a day and spencer's being inactive so that's also not true so being physically active exercising uh reducing simple sugars in the diet all of these will go towards reducing triglycerides and visceral fat as well wonderful doc i think we have taken more than time that you have taken you are required back at the hospital thank you for joining us today and a million million thanks wonderful happy new year thank you doctor bye thank you doc thank you so shui we had dr ashish contractor and um i guess if i've never run a marathon and he's run a marathon and he was saying if somebody suddenly decides to run a marathon never run in their life that's me that's me ryan fernando i run on my treadmill i do i do 11 or 12 on the treadmill for 30 seconds and then i walk for about 20 minutes and then i sprint again but today's session is all about the people who we have to convince way to dance you are a dance instructor you are a physical fitness trainer you are a crossfit athlete if somebody came up to you shui and asked you where do i start or they start and everyone makes this new year's resolution and they fail within 20-25 days what would be your advice start big and push your body because i see this happen in the gym trainers get enthusias enthusiastic people get enthusiastic but by february most of the crowd that has joined us has disappeared you just have the regulars so what's what's your advice you've gone through many new years and what would you advise yeah for anyone and everyone like irrespective of what age they belong to right i think the fundamental will always be the same first learn to get your body moving right and only then incorporate other types of activities and when i say learn to you know get your body moving i just say start with walking a lot more often that is your fundamental your body is designed to move and if you're not able to walk enough steps in a given day then maybe incorporating other activities i'm not saying is wrong but maybe it'll be too soon yes you can start off with yoga you can start off with pilates you can start with you know just a little bit of jogging running dancing especially for people who love music and dance all of this is great just 20 minutes 30 minutes a day but the most fundamental is moving your body more often so my recommendation to everyone is start moving uh if you are doing 2500 steps a day because you have a set entry lifestyle you're working a lot of hours sitting in front of the laptop step it up to maybe 3500 start slow or maybe 5 000 and then slowly over weeks you'll see you're able to push it to six thousand seven thousand right start with that but otherwise apart from moving and walking uh my go-to is always 20 to 30 minutes of activity and choose your favorite activity that's the second important thing when you choose your favorite activity you will be consistent and then when you're consistent after like a month or so you will see results and when you see results you're excited to continue that journey and then that 20 30 minutes will become 40 minutes 50 minutes you know you end up spending a lot more time and i have a lot of these examples people who test exercising you know we convince them to just do 15 minutes a day not asking even a minute more right and today uh you know this group of people who started with 15 minutes do like 45 50 minutes and literally change their body composition you know become leaner stronger far lower fat percentage so on and so forth so pick an activity that you love doing and it can be absolutely anything it can be a sport right i do not say that sport and exercises are too similar things but both let you move right even sports is fun a lot of us love sports and you know we don't do too much sports because we don't have time but pick a spot you love pick any activity that you can do consistently for a month or pick a trainer so there are very space ryan if one wants to really start a personal trainer can do wonders you have been personal training for years now yeah that's a point i'm sorry i'm interrupting you but this is a point i think for all our listeners to listen in for the fitness industry uh people feel that if i invest money in a trainer uh it's it's going to be expensive like most gym memberships in india around 12 000 rupees a thousand rupees a month on an average if you go to a high class gym maybe it's 2000 rupees a month so people think oh i'm spending two thousand rupees a month for the gym or the exercise or the coach or the yoga instructor but the personal training cost is let's say anywhere starting from 5 000 to 40 000 rupees a month right uh and let me share my experience i've been personal training for now 10 years with a personal trainer and i had the same um i had the same fundamental principle that i'm going to be spending you know five eight thousand rupees a month and those days it used to be the emi of my car right now my uh input to everyone uh out there listening in today is that whilst you can change your car you can't change your body so your investment with your trainer which is a post i put up yesterday um i have i had mr vishnupai who recruited a personal trainer at the age of 72. with one year of personal training his metabolic age he was 72 birth certificate and 73 metabolic his body age came down to 60. 13 years of metabolic age down because he lost about 11 kgs of only fat and retained all his muscle because of the personal trainer so at 72 the personal trainer didn't allow him to go over or extra now mr vishnupay earns about one cr per year one crore a year so that personal trainer just gave him 13 crores more of additional income so if you begin to look at your investment in exercise start with the thought to work out then start with the thought to do an activity then go to a place to do that activity then engage with a person or friends and speaking of french way do you think when people join together as friends or a group of people there's more chance of success of them continuing in in the year yeah 100 we've noticed even at cult right group workouts are far more successful or a partner workout like you do with your personal trainer right are far far more successful because uh people feel accountable like even when i work with one trainer as a group exercise i've built a community or a family you know who actually check on me when i don't show up consecutively for two three days hey you know why haven't you been coming so yes the number of people who are become consistent are far more when they work out as a buddy or as a personal trainer or as a group definitely what's the best that you've seen from a couch potato joining an exercise program and what's the worst you've seen what's the best so you know uh i think from a couch for a couch potato or for someone who's got very sedentary lifestyle uh well i've seen how they just jump into exercise or let's say we open in new new cities every year right or every other month at least we were so people would really get excited about oh cult is in our city and they would like all come in for that first class a lot of these guys who've never probably exercised before right in front of my eyes i've seen people just like drop you know like 20 minutes into the workout they just drop they're sweating and they drop not because of anything else because their body is not used to it right and then what what i typically do is i keep like a candy and i immediately give them a candy and then they then like feeling a little better you know so this is like the worst because nobody has educated them exactly how that transition should be how to start slow and moderate and then go to that advanced level right but people normally who start off with like you know listen to the trainer do shorter duration of workouts um and probably like i said again do you get do you get this statement i was an athlete in college i am now 47 years old but i was an athlete in college do you get that statement yeah from my father i mean fortunately baby i i have to listen to him because he's a super active man except what happened recently but otherwise he's been active all his life and the only reason he's able to survive his diabetes that stent in his heart and all of that is because of his activity every day two hours of consistent you know walking and basic exercise never a day not even a sunday he believes in not waking up in the morning and doing it so yeah once an athlete always an athlete i guess but we kind of lose those years because we're also caught up with life and profession but it's really not hard ryan for any of us to just be active i keep telling people that even if you don't go and exercise it's okay if you can get up every five minutes every hour for five minutes every hour walk around just around your room or something you're sorted right just moving your body more often is what we really need i think we have two questions here yes so one question is uh what is genetic testing so uh jyothi asked this question so in the new age world when we work with elite athletes we work with celebrities um i am at kua nutrition clinics doing what is known as nutrigenomics neutrogenomics is the science of taking a saliva sample opening up your dna dna is a software code in the human body and a certain lab will do the checking of that software code so they can check for what they can check for the color of your eyes they can check whether they're going to go bald they're going to they can even check whether you're going to have a heart attack risk and there are huge things from the diet point of view like for example i checked for gluten sensitivity now my dna says that i'm gluten sensitive but my gut does not say i'm gluten sensitive and this is something very interesting that i want to share with people about gene testing we have recently started a cardiac dietary rehabilitation division so we are helping shwathambri thousands of people who have high cholesterol as dr ashish said people have high lipoprotein a lipoprotein b homocysteine c reactive protein these are all inflammatory markers with your cholesterol and your diabetes which is hbo and see if it's high so such people are more susceptible to metabolic disease and incidences of heart disease so when we do a genetic test you get a crystal ball gazing i'm like an astrologer that's saying there's a chance that in the future you may have an issue why don't you keep this uh rudraksha so this rosary or this uh you know these beads with you and start praying but for me those beads and all are all related to your nutrition from your perspective your beads are all about exercise so genetic testing is doing a dna analysis and seeing do you have a gene that says it's thumbs up in your body 50 50 or thumbs down very interestingly i am gluten intolerant for the last eight years i gave up bread wheat biscuits pastry so i only buy gluten free stuff which is from wheat barley and rye and last week when we launched the cardiac rehab division schwa thumbery this is a very interesting we found a study that had rats because rats have about a 98 genetic profile to us and it has a short shelf life so you can do multiple generations of that so they they caused plaque to form in the rats by feeding them a very high fat diet okay and then they divided them into two groups in one group of rats they gave them gluten which is found in wheat and in one group they gave them no gluten and they found that the plaque which is those blockages in the artery were much more stickier in the rats who were on a gluten-based diet that is wheat was there in their diet and the diet that did not have the wheat which did not have the gluten those rats had nearly 60 percent lesser incidences of black formation which led to sudden deaths in the rats even rats get heart attacks unfortunately so the perspective over here for me was i could do a dna test which got nothing related to my heart from a nutrition point of view and figure out whether i should or should not avoid so i call this a light living wherein when you when i come to your gym shui i'm buying a lovely pair of shoes whereas we could always work out barefoot so the fashionability the knowledge is to wear something that's fashionable but people don't understand the fashion is actually science and in nutrition the fashionability could be to check your genetics to figure out what it is that can work another one is a caffeine gene do you remember your caffeine gene should you drink coffee should you not drink coffee no so my genetic test says i should not be drinking coffee in fact my gut test also said kind of say no to coffee but i love coffee and i remember our last conversation you said uh let me see how i can give you that one coffee yeah so so when i'm doing your nutrition counseling here's the perspective research has shown people who are not caffeine responders as per their dna should take only one cup of coffee a day anything more raises your blood pressure and increases your risk element of heart attack or stroke so it's a very very interesting thing that you're very fit and everything i'm only operating from a perspective that i have to always convince you that you know maybe just one cup of coffee would be good enough not more than that cool we haven't i think i think i i must add here something else that i wanted to talk to you about the genetic this was it my genetic test also shows the fact that uh my fat loss doesn't necessarily always come from just exercise right because i exercise a lot and not a lot but very consistently and i do see a lot of gains from it but i keep going back to ryan because i know through my genetic test that just by exercising i'm not going to get to that goal you know of maintaining certain fat percentage i need food intervention i need to eat better eat smarter eat right so that's that's a very important point in the gene testing and the sports part uh we did for you shwathambri uh where we checked your endurance your power your cartilage damage your fatigue like i have the fatigue gene so i fatigue very fast so when i do my workouts i tend to take a little longer break between two sets in your case uh which was very surprising uh and this is for everyone out there people assume that exercise is going to be the absolute bar of fat burning but you may not have the genetics or the software code in you so basically it's like this sweet tamari doesn't have a pen drive in her that she can connect which says okay mr exercise start burning all the fat that dna is missing so she has to do constant physical work whereas there are certain people who can do high intensity activity and that just switches switches on the fat burning uh mechanism in the human body so that's uh that's found out right now and this is something that can be done uh we've got a few more questions yeah miss coyle's asking these days we're seeing high uric acid and high creatinine in many runners what could be the reason supplements or is it normal first things first in india we are predominantly a vegetarian country people assume that they can get a lot of uric acid from a high protein diet and when vegetarians decide to take up exercise they decide to eat more amount of dals which inadvertently may increase your uric acid so either the the the vegetarian dolls may increase the uric acid number one i've seen people who are pure vegetarians increase their milk and uric acid levels go up number two vegetarians assume they're vegetarians but you are actually non-vegetarian when you're an exercise person how you cannibalize your own muscle there's anabolism and there's catabolism anabolism is to build muscle catabolism is to break down muscle so when you are on a low protein diet you eat into your own vegetarian muscles so when you break down your muscles my assumption is that your uric acid which is a byproduct of the purines metabolism it's a breakdown of dna of animal protein and animal protein includes your own muscle as well as the creatine that is stored in your muscle and that could be why it's going up i don't believe it's supplements well sometimes yes people tend to douse with more supplements it's not the right element to go forward and then joshi asked in the same breath uh even after eating 2.2 kgs of protein and doing weight regular weight railing i'm still losing muscle mass along with fat maybe you have a gene like i have which is shwetambri knows me to be working out really crazy and heavy and i have no big muscles to show for it certain of us uh do not have the gene which is responsible for uh building muscle and and and i i learned this wherein in i think in spain or italy they began to remove this muscle they remove this gene from the cows that when they remove the gene it caused an overgrowth of muscle so some of us have a genetic predisposition to be leaner thinner and no matter how much of protein you know guys i get all the free protein in the world i call up fast enough fast enough to send me a truckload of protein i used to work for body fuels i used to work for mba i had all the free protein available in the world i should look like arnold schwarzenegger and say i'll be back but it's not protein that builds muscle it is the stimulus of weight training it is the stimulus of weight training and the correct diet so joshie if you are not getting results then maybe just putting protein into your body might be a wrong thing because you might be setting yourself up for more protein from a heart attack perspective by increasing your inflammatory markers so there's a lot we're doing from the microbiome which is your gut testing and when you put the wrong foods in they create a lot of inflammatory markers which go into your blood and then your c-reactive protein goes up and you increase the c-reactive or the inflammatory markers start beating up cholesterol so cholesterol gets more stickier sugar starts increasing because you want to eat more and more because even protein causes an insulin spike yes um so shwatami i don't know if i told you this but i had put a continuous glucose monitoring device on my hand last month and i was shocked to find out something like a cup of rice put my sugar really high up there so maybe joshua you want to check out a continuous glucose monitoring device and see you know how you want to go forward i also want to quickly add for surveys joshi rhyme that in his training you know he can probably change the way his weight training is being done right he can probably look at you know more hypertrophy model he can you know look at doing certain type like don't do very lightweight training or don't do extremely heavy do in between but for like eight to 12 reps so maybe he can change the way his weight training is being done to achieve you know certain maybe get his muscle mass to a better number you know that can also make a huge difference uh anik is asking and think shwathamri this is for you i follow low intensity exercises brisk walking and strength training to reduce my fat but i feel i need to add more variety to it as it gets boring which exercises would you recommend for fat loss yeah fab so you love it seems like you like brisk walking right uh so i would say continue that because that's something that's worked very well for me doing about 10 12 15 000 steps a day is like the best way to do get a lot of fat loss i'm not sure if you enjoy dance dance-based workout but dance fitness personally has not only worked for me but for a lot of my clients it has worked very well for fat loss boxing has worked extremely well and these are all the cardio kind of exercises i'm talking about uh is great for fat loss and then you know there is running all of these are great for fat loss but i would say mix it up with light weights right if you don't want to since i read that you're doing low intensity even with weights picking up lighter weights you can do low intensity exercises very basic stuff you know focus on your squats and lunges and some core workout just with your weights just adding a little bit of resistance training can contribute a lot towards fat loss so just alternate your cardio and strength days keep it low intensity not a problem you have your brisk walking taking care of the big chunk of the fat there uh but yeah mix it up do different things i i keep mixing it up you know the whole week different types of exercises conditioning and strength training it's fun and you get the desired results how often should we have a cheat day once a week or once a month how many calories can we have on a cheat day you know viber this is a brilliant question and i think mathematically it's very difficult as a nutritionist to have my personal supremacy on a diet even when i give a nutrition plan the calories are subject to a plus or minus 20 percent uh because of the way the food is grown because of your katori at home the way the methodology of preparation whilst i might tell you to make a certain type of vegetable subzi your servant decides to put four tablespoons of oil in that subsidy so the calorie content does always change so what i feel weibov is that a cheat meal is based more from a psychological perspective rather than a physiological perspective so over the years i've found this mantra that works very well i personally love having a bit of chocolate or i personally love having a coke every now and then which is the the aerated beverage so like you might find me at a leading restaurant with uh a cup of aerated beverage i i actually just take a little bit 100 ml now what's my logic over here i know that the cheat meal is psychological so i portion control the cheat meal i try and do it frequently but the rest of my meals i'm very very focused on monday to friday or saturday the breakfast lunch dinner whatever i'm doing i'm very specific and i keep the consistency on my workout or movement to know that i'm not consuming more than i'm actually uh requiring and and this is food for thought in sri tamri i'm i'm actually going to be working on something which i'll invite you on board later with which is i want to build the world's first bmi carbon footprint uh making you feel guilty scale think about it the heavier you are on this planet the more your carbon footprint so forget about heart attack forget about everything else if you are if you're if you're a warrior i predict in this 2022 that there will be a shortly a day where you will step onto the weighing scale at the airport along with your baggage and then uh vistara will not tell you me mr fernando you are overweight i'll be looking at my baggage i'll be looking at myself did you check the guy behind me he's like 200 kgs with his baggage combined so very very important a cheating meal is psychological it's not physiological so people think they will let go for one sheet meal there's no physical activity on that saturday or sunday so bye-bye if i were you i would do camping i would do or i would do my crossfit i would do my dancing at the night club and just burn a whole lot of calories and keep the portion small in the cheat meal he asked another question to you shwathamri which is is it okay for obese people to run if yes is running on the treadmill advice every day or alternate days yeah absolutely i think obese people should start with walking move to brisk walking you know easy jog and then go into like a little more faster running treadmills can be used outdoor running also can be done there is honestly no problem using treadmills i would just say that uh you know for someone who's obese and is sedentary and they'll have some sort of joint pain and all of that that will happen and that will happen irrespective whether they're running on the treadmill or running outside on the road which is why i'm saying start slow but yes it'll be great if they can start you know jogs and walks and brisk walks and running it's a fabulous way it's easy it's simple not dependent on anything and good to start losing that extra fat in the body you know sri tamri i work with a lot of orthopedic surgeons my pop in law is a orthopedic surgeon and um you know you get to listen to the physios the the knee experts acl reconstruction when a person runs the knee impacts at 4.5 times its body weight so let's assume somebody's 100 kg starting weight of 100 kgs 400 kgs on that knee when they run so the ideal perspective that has always been told to me from the orthopedic community uh is that uh if somebody's at about 100 kgs and they need to be at 60 kgs they're carrying an extra 40 kgs 40 kg so uh the the thumb rule is if you walk 15 000 steps a day you can get a 2 kg fat loss per month so viber i would say that 2 kgs fat loss per month by walking 15 000 steps a day no load on that if you want to run run in a swimming pool all all people who have bmi above 24 should in my opinion run in a swimming pool to save your knees so that you can run even when you're a 70 year old at 60 kgs absolutely so that would be my advice to to to to viber and uh um if you if your families are born runners then you should have no joint iteration and stuff like that so then please do run but if you come from uh ryan fernando's family where half the family is on walking sticks and all and you have joint iteration then you want to be focusing on cardiovascular exercises not using your legs to run but doing dance workouts or continuous workouts or going working yeah go keeping your your rest between workouts and stuff like that in the gym and stuff like that and sri tamri that's one of the reasons why i never turned up at your dance classes because i realized i would dance i love to dance but then my knees are gone the next day even as a light weight so you know you have to figure this out you you have to figure this out and so i think as experts when we are working with you it's always an individualized basis to your diet individualized basis to to your exercise so get in touch with your expert and ask them what we want to do there's a nutrition question from manisha hey manisha how are you doing is honey lemon warm water morning helpful for weight loss this has been around for centuries in ayurveda very interestingly i share you the scientific perspective which you probably won't find on any internet channel i was recently received a product from canada which for for people who have gut problems to heal the lining of their stomach you need to boost something known as n-acetyl glucosamine now n-acetyl glucosamine forms mucin which is you can call like the scaffolding inside your intestine which builds the protection and the integrity which allows for better absorption of food when you combine glucose glutamine and fructose you produce the body's natural and acetyl glucosamine when you take lemon and you take honey and warm water you're providing a certain raw material early morning so manisha what i would recommend to you find an amino acid called glutamine put about three grams of it in your honey and lemon water and take it early morning because it heals your gut lining and when you heal your gut lining metabolism absorption gets better you don't need to eat trashy food and your body gives you feedback that you're absorbing better so even when you eat a crappy meal which is high calorie the body kind of stops you but when your gut is ravaged or damaged the feedback signal of satiety to the brain is shortened so there's a lot of wisdom ancient wisdom and for everyone who's listened in this far here's a tip the pharmacy pharmacy industry doesn't tell you how to reduce cholesterol minus drugs for all of you who have higher cholesterol but are not yet on statins please take a statin if your doctor has advised it because it saves your life in fact when my clients come to me i say do not remove your statins continue to statins till we get it lower down enough for your doctor to give permission remit what's a natural way to drop down cholesterol 5 grams of organic amla powder every morning take a teaspoon toss it into your mouth have a glass of water five almonds and if you can have an apple a day and two tablespoons of oats a day you do these four things amla you have um you have the apple apple you have the almonds five almonds and you have two tablespoons of oats a day this will reduce your bad cholesterol which is the ldl and boost your hdl i significantly have seen it happen i've given away a celebrity choir nutrition clinic secret my dietitians company so why are you giving away all the secrets nobody will come to us for a diet plan but i do genuinely believe that everyone listening in you know my first car was a second-hand thousand right and as we move through life we upgrade our vehicles as you move through life you'll upgrade your diet you'll upgrade your workout so i'm saying to you you cannot change this body of yours it's not replaceable i can't make ryan fernando skoda to ryan fernando mercedes to ryan fernando rolls-royce i can only make ryan fernando be as best as possible in terms of diet and exercise so these are small small things that you can start doing be aware and schwa tamri i know you've been my client for so long but if i come home today and have dinner with you um will there be organic tomatoes in your house uh i just bring my vegetables from a farm that's all okay good so we are hoping that this farm is organic so furthering to your counsel let's imagine you're in my counseling room today the reason i want organic is because it reduces the pesticide and chemical and insecticide load on my liver and kidney that could be another reason people are getting morbidly obese another tip and i think the e-commerce apps are going to hate us for this your zomato and swiggy are the devil in the disguise for not looking great i repeat zomato and swiggy are the devil in disguise for not making you look and feel great i'll tell you why last night i wanted to eat a high protein meal i was too lazy to go to my fridge would hatch organic food what did i do swiggy  press a button 45 minutes later i had something that was unhealthy i wanted to have sushi which was healthy but i ended up being distracted by the app and all this discount and all so i think in 2022 those of you who are on the borderline of i'm fed up of my life i want to change my life i i want to do something i'm depressed i'm not feeling happy i wish i could be a celebrity i wish i could be a millionaire the one tip that i would give you to start feeling better to start looking up is stop ordering from outside the reason behind this is i will tell you many many years ago i ran a very successful brand that uh provided healthy meals to the corporates but the guys that prepared those foods no matter how much i remember yelling and screaming in the kitchen and it's like you're only a nutritionist you're not even a chef was the way they treated food no matter what the principles no matter what the restaurant owner wants the people preparing your food are cooks they will not wash the cabbage which has got all the insecticides and pesticides before cutting it and putting it in your food this is what happens in a in a in a commercial kitchen not washed thrown directly into the pan so even if little insecticides and pesticides have to be washed off people restaurant guys are gonna gonna assassinate me on the internet for this they're gonna say how do you know have you been in our kitchen i am telling you if i take a confession from every person that runs so we have to incentivize them to wash sink one thing to sink three so pesticides are more in your ordered food from outside number two dalda palm oil has huge organoleptic properties on your taste buds there was this dhaba in i don't know where i don't i don't know it was in puna or something so the cardiologist convinced that guy to prepare his paw bhaji with a different oil instead of using dalda overnight apparently people started disappearing because the taste changed so so the fact of the matter is when you use palmitic acid which is the most aggressive for plaque formation i repeat so when i go out people are always looking at me like crying why you're not very happy eating out i'm thinking 150 k rupees per kg bloody olive oil is 600 rupees a kg which guy will use olive oil which guy will use cold press sesame oil which guy will use cold press ground nut oil so i'm i'm just appealing to people that in 2022 if you have money hire a chef if you don't have that much of money five of you get together have a party invite a chef to cook for you and buy all the produce and make it organic and tell the chef don't use dalda by the way speaking of dalda i take a blood test of omega 6 and omega 3 and i send it to norway to check your inflammation rate so if you have a heart disease i can afford 9 000 bucks prick your finger send the blood test norway i did it sweetheart and so i have to make a public confession the zomato and swiggy convinces me to have my cheat meal from outside every week my palmitic oil levels were high yeah so to bring it down i asked the swedish guy what's your reason stop eating this trans fat stop eating this palm oil uh and you will watch your uh omega-6 and omega-9 automatically drop it to the inflammatory markers right there are there a lot of more questions uh let's let's just take four five more i'm just finding any exercise questions yeah there is one on uh poonam asking does cardio make you lose muscle so very quickly poonam uh yes that's the answer but you need cardio you can't do without cardio right i'll give you my own example i did cardio for a living right that was my profession teaching a lot of dance fitness and etc so when i didn't combine it with strength training i ended up hurting myself because of extreme muscle loss and now over the last many years since i've incorporated a lot of strength training and alternated well with cardio i have zero injuries zero aches and pains and etc and you know i have good fat loss decent you know muscle gain and all of that so if you're doing only cardio yes you'll lose a good amount of fat but after after losing that fat it will start eating into your muscle so you need a combination of cardio and weights right yeah then there is a question again from uvashi you want me to read it for you started strength training i find it very difficult to consume proteins in every meal i tried whey and i got uti can vegetarian protein be included with animal protein wow you know what before i take this question i know you have a busy schedule i want to ask you what are you doing for the new year's in terms of cult fit before i let you go i'm going to take all of these questions offline with everybody but yeah i heard something about a belly burn yeah sounds quite corny you know i feel like belly burn okay very quickly again so this is a program that's gonna start it's a four week uh workout program with me the program is called belly burn season one was last year season two starts day after tomorrow which is monday we wanted to start you know the new year where do i find it where do i google up for it everything online you just have to download the culprit app and the workout is there on the cult app so it's a c-u-l-t-f-i-t app called fit app okay yeah culprit app and also we have a one-month free trial period for everybody to use who who's never used the app before so most probably this entire program can probably be used by people for free it's a four week program and guess what it's not just about working out monday to friday you know with me you also have recoveries planned on saturday which is a proper recovery workout and no fat burn can happen without eating right so we have a meal plan which is obviously designed by ryan fernando and qua right so it's a combination of a workout again body weight optional dumbbells i've given options for dumbbells as well it's a 45 minute workout every day you can choose any time you want right it's not like i'm doing it on zoom or anything 5 am all the way up until like 10 30 11 pm it's available for you to consume and the meal plan which is with ryan is also there and it's on the app so you just have to download it and follow it through for the entire four weeks there's also these challenges where 15 000 steps a day for you know intimate advanced athletes for beginners it's just about six to eight thousand steps a day and it's for all beginners intermediate advanced because we've scaled it down scale it up based on what your intensity is if you're starting out restarting all of that and uh in belly burn one just very quickly ryan we've seen great successes we had over 10 000 people doing it and we saw huge success rate in terms of inch loss and that's what we look at we don't ask people to really step on the weighing scale we say take a measure measuring tape and tell me the difference are your old clothes fitting you better are you clothes fitting you're better stuff like that so we've seen huge success of course i think four weeks consistently working out eating right anybody will see success so yeah if you feel like working out with me we start monday so shui this is awesome i think uh everywhere we start off with something new and we get 10 000 people let's hope this year that you get a million people and i wish you all the best i'll be seeing you in your next diet session at my clinic uh your nutrition plan is almost getting ready so shwathamri said in december itself you know what i need to get started in the new year uh i don't think she needs a nutrition plan from an aesthetic point of view which is why most of you were like can i lose this fat or can i can i get these love handles off shwathamri is an elite athlete her perspective is how do i get anti-aging how do i get more out of my workout how do i get better energy during the day so nutrition perspective is not only fat burning from the belly area which is for most people a big chunk of your thought process but i would say look beyond that you're going to live on this planet for 10 20 30 40 50 60 years 70 years maybe if you're a youngster watching this video you can't replace your vehicle you can only take it to the rice servicing garage one of those servicing garages is cult fit where shwatambri practices or any exercise place that you love and the other garage where you can take it for maintenance is the nutritionist who can help you eat scientifically instead of you eating out of love and culture from your parents shaytan i won't hold you back i've got a lot of nutrition questions i'm going to take that i know you're i know your little guy must be somewhere around this and and little little girl needs you over there and um it's a saturday but i just want to say i i want to tell everyone who's you know listening and watching that um exercise and nutrition go hand in hand there is no way you can separate the two even for someone like me i know for a fact that i've got decent metabolism when i eat a slice of cake i know it's not just getting stored some of it is actually burning away right i know that i have that confidence but i know that if i need to consistently you know eat well i need a good plan and i need you know someone like ryan to help me through it right i i can probably make a so-called meal plan but not like what a ryan fernando or aqua would do so which is why i always keep in mind workout consistently eat right enjoy your meals whenever you do you know the the cheat meal i call it the reward meal but yeah do it right all the way and enjoy the benefits that the body gets and the mind gets thank you thank you so much thank you today everyone stay safe and i'll see you in your next diet session i'll see you happy new year bye bye wish you the same okay so we've got far more questions coming in over here which i'm going to answer and um anushka says i am allergic to gluten and dairy what can normal middle class people have as an alternative to both gluten and dairy so anushka i am also gluten intolerant and i'm also lactose and dairy intolerance i'm exactly like you i look at cashew milk i look at coconut milk i look at almond milk and i look at oat milk urban clap has an amazing oat milk now milk is milk okay a milk coffee or a milk rasmalai there's no difference between cashew and that okay you've got to get one thing on the mind the completely different taste so you have to transition into accepting the new thing like coffee with almond milk and coffee with normal milk is two different worlds but over a period of two or three years your taste buds acclimatize like for example to the in the morning i had a sip of coffee with real milk in it because it was made for somebody and i was like let me try it for a little bit i had it like i don't like this i like my oatmeal coffee so that is one perspective for the gluten perspective um rice oats corn johar bajra amranth all of these are possible in terms of gluten options there's there's a brilliant bakery in ludhiana called sai foods ludhiana sai foods ludhiana they have rusk biscuit which is gluten free they have coconut biscuits as a kid i grew up with jam biscuits i can't believe i'm giving this information out as a nutritionist okay but you're human right so i would say that at four o'clock in the evening you wanna have two or three jam biscuits uh or cream biscuits you do get them gluten free i live in bangalore and now most of the metros have some amazing bakers now these are people that are going to make us put on weight because gluten free options are like normal options full of sugar and full of baking items into it so you know it is what you need to do which is get in touch with a nutritionist to help you plan a better shopping list a better uh a choice of foods like how much should you eat you know at the end of the day um somebody just said my calcium level is inefficient what should i do um get in touch with us at core nutrition i do genuinely believe that when you are when you try you know recently what happened is so i have this uh old cycle okay so i thought area old cycle now we'll take some free advice from somebody how to get it repaired and all of that stuff i ended up spending more money because i took free advice i should have just gone to that cycle mechanic say by yellow 500 rupees just go take care though but inside conducive fellow inside of me said no boss am i who's going to spend an i'll do some googling up and all of that stuff whenever you try to not i mean the same thing goes with mobile phones do you try and repair your own mobile phone do you try and repair your own car your car's making a sound take it to the mechanic your calcium levels are out talk to your doctor talk to your nutritionist i think uh that that would really really help you you know somebody said they tried whey protein and got a uti um i i would i would say in 2022 and i know a lot of supplement companies are not going to like me for this i used to work for supplement companies i think the problem is not protein i think the problem first lies with you not knowing how much you need to eat of calories first level then how much of protein do you need for in those calories and then which protein should you add from the natural diet which i believe can generally fulfill your protein requirement now for many years i took protein supplements and tried to bulk up and you know everyone says oh ryan fernando you're so skinny you're a skinny nutritionist you know there's an internal turmoil like what can i do you know my genetics don't allow me to put on weight i've always been skinny i had gluten allergies i had pimples bleed blue blah blah i would douse myself with all of these whey proteins and plant proteins and nothing would happen and only my gut would be bad in this case a person saying i got a uti could it be coincidence here's what you do if you're willing to risk the uti again do another session three four months later have the whey protein add nettle tea which is a diuretic nettle tea will flush second is add cranberry juice if you're not overweight because what cranberries do is there's the bacteria that causes uti has a hook so that hook helps the bacteria to climb up the urethra which is your urinary canal so that bacteria goes up and causes a uti what you can do is you can take cranberries or cranberry extract or cranberry juice if you're not overweight because cranberry juice is high in sugar and add that to your protein diet and see whether it improves which vegetarian proteins i would recommend if you're a female soy protein works okay a brown rice protein works okay green pea protein works okay so let me give you another perspective in 2022 now when we do microbiome testing and we do food allergy testing what we come up with is that when i've recommended a green pea protein plant-based isolate to my client my food allergy report says that my client is allergic to greenpeace so the biggest problem in today's world is this assumption that i need to take a protein supplement and without testing a food sensitivity or a food intolerance you douse yourself now how much of green peas can you eat you can eat a cup of green peas but one scoop of green pea protein isolate technically is equivalent to nearly six or seven cups of green peas who eats that sort of quantity so imagine the hypo allergic the allergic status that you're putting into your body so keep this in mind you do not need to douse high amounts of protein and trainers are recommending high amounts of protein my only request to you as a trainer if you're watching in is this check if your client agrees with that commercially produced protein which is devoid of carbohydrate and fat which is technically making it a processed and packaging food so because it's a processing and packaged food could there be a issue that you're causing by asking your client to douse with this could there be a issue and that's the reason why i say when you decide to do a aggressive fitness program get your diet with a professional done and even if your trainer is handling your diet ask for a blood test ask for a food allergy test if you have enough of money do the nutrition genetic test if you have even more money do a microbiome testing last year i did not buy a new car i chose to invest more money in understanding more about my microbiome more about my genetics more about how my fitness trainer can work with me better so i think that should be your focus in 2022 spend more on experiences and one of those experiences you yourself and that's very very very important somebody asked how can i reduce triglyceride levels again triglyceride levels i have seen amla as part of the diet works reduce your white flour and reduce your white hydrates white rice you will see a drop in the fructose and the triglyceride levels and also try and maybe work more with vegetables and less with fruits again on a case case-to-case basis i can work very aggressively with you and figure out what can be done sugar uh if money is not an issue for many of you and god of uh

after evening if you don't get acidity and you don't get mouth sores or any issues of acidity then cinnamon is known to improve in fat burning in certain individuals who are response whoever responds to what is called as cinnamon aldehyde which kind of mimics um an insulin booster it increases the receptors of uh insulin on the cell which allows for greater blood sugar betterment what which exercise would you recommend for fat loss so since the cardiologist is no longer here and the fitness expert is no longer here i have seen with hundreds of my clients including amir khan the recommendation has been to walk to lose visceral fat to walk to lose subcutaneous fat you need more than 15 000 steps a day you need more than 15 000 steps a day you need to walk because when you are in a low energy heart rate you utilize fat as a battery so let me explain this to you very easily okay so imagine uh the red pen as my carbohydrate and the orange pen as my uh as my fat so every muscle in the human body will utilize either carbohydrate or utilize fat when you do low intensity activity jaadu pocha walking in your house going up the stairs neat non-exercise adaptive thermogenesis you utilize more amount of fat up to 70 percent of the energy requirement during that period comes from fat and 30 from carbohydrate now the moment you start running and your heart is not conditioned your heart is not conditioned your heart rate goes up and then you start using more and more carbohydrate as a substrate and lesser and lesser fat so the secret to fat burning is slow intensity for your heart but longer duration to recruit the fat burning battery and this is the essential secret in addition to uh monitoring your diet so very very important if you want to do a nutrition plan with me um you can you can do it at the koa nutrition clinics uh it's so so important that i feel that in 2022 spend some money on your body towards you know getting healthier um suji asked should i avoid gluten content when i have a thyroid at the face value suji what i would say to you suji if i can make a joke you get gluten-free suji and you get normal sooji which is made from rava which is made from wheat traditionally soji in india was always in south india made with rice and that's why people didn't have problem i think a lot of suji that is made today is made with gluten-based wheat because maida is cheaper so so so yeah my my information is if you do a gene test and you're gluten sensitive you have the dna in you then i would advise you to go off gluten but also look at tsh thyroid stimulating hormone requires 10 nutrients for its functioning tsh is situated released from the pituitary which goes and acts on your thyroid t3 t4 but people immediately say oh tsa is not working let's take a medicine so you go directly over here instead i'm saying what are those 10 nutrients for your tsh to work well my wife when i married her had thyroid for the longest period today she takes not a single medication for her thyroid gluten free and those 10 micronutrients of which vitamin d vitamin b12 vitamin c chromium selenium magnesium zinc and an amino acid which i can't forget which i'm forgetting right now but there are 10 micronutrients that are highly required for your thyroid tsh functioning and i think our nutrition is lacking and that's why it goes uh uh you know bad anushka saying i try to eat clean most of the times but then i'm not able to achieve my flawless skin goals though i have good genetics i have omega-3 and vitamin c and water so if if so when anushka sharma the film star came to me the whole perspective was i need filters of testing blood test food intolerance test genetic test microbiome test put all of these filters figure out what are the foods you cannot eat the moment you start moving those foods out so unusual if you see i have had adult acne all my life so i've got poked up skin now as a teenager if somebody met me and told me ryan you are gluten sensitive i would have been like okay let's try it but in 1996 when i was in medical college and had pimples nobody told me about it but in 2011 when i did the gene testing it came back hey mr gohan fernando you are not supposed to eat gluten i stopped it and i never had adult acne for 20 days of stopping gluten and i'm like whoa i have all my skin drying or my pimples are disappearing and i went on to a six month gluten free and i didn't have a pimple and my wife's birthday was on the 27th and i ate gluten cake that came for her i popped in a gluten enzyme tablet but i got a stye on my eye if you can see over here i never get stars never i used to get it when i was taking gluten and i was like ah it's the gluten it's the gluten in the cake maybe it's the milk i ate a lot of christmas chocolates so skin what you know if i take my skin and i fold it on the inside it becomes my throat my stomach my intestines it becomes everything so what kujali and damages happening out there comes up on your skin so if you want to glow you got to change your diet i would suggest do the correct anushka do the correct diagnostics figure out the kujili molecules get them out of your life and then put in the molecules that are good doing very well for you you've written omega 3 i've had one client once in my life when we gave her omega-3 she got worse skin omega-3 is brilliant omega-3 is really really brilliant for good health but go figure not all not all foods fit for the same person in the same what you say tenacity or same action and that's why has formed koa nutrition kua in latin means incapacity so figure out what foods uh you can uh uh uh you know put into it no novag djokovic says i'm gluten intolerant so thanks for the joke whoever put it over there i have been watching uh novak and i've got all his books since 2011 and i would shout from the treetops to all the sports people including sushil kumar one two olympic medals for me okay beta do not take gluten in your diet if you want to win an olympic medal i'm going to be working in 2022 with pv sindhu i'm going to try and convince her not to have gluten in a diet for better athletic performance i'm writing a book next year on why wheat why we should not eat it even if you're not gluten sensitive there's enough proof in the pudding which is a simple thing all of you could do for 20 days don't eat any wheat waste product check your resting heart rate 20 days don't eat any gluten in your diet if your resting heart rate comes down gluten is a culprit in life try that as an experiment if you have the patience and time which are the best cooking oils to be used in a home hey there is no best cooking oil to use on your whole it is bio individual in my house there are two bottles of oil which has a man picture and a woman picture my wife is from the east coast of india i'm from the west coast of india completely genetic different profiles in terms of coconut oil works for me mustard oil works for her olive oil works for her olive oil doesn't work for me so you got to figure it out from a genetic perspective is soy fit soya milk really good for a 10 year old who competes near if your kid is a boy i would not give soya milk more than twice a week i'd have to work with my dietitian for your kid in terms of what could be the other dietary natural alternatives and if your child is a girl then soya milk is okay but these commercial companies i'm not too happy with the amount of sugar that they put into it so what i would do is i would go more with like tempeh which is fermented soya which tastes and feels like paneer and make natural dishes like that or make like a cottage cheese rasmalai but the rasmalai is is replaced with the tempe and it comes out really nicely just just replace paneer with with uh with with the with the tempe and you could make a sweet dish for your kid to get more protein is amway plant protein good um i used to work for amway many many years ago in the past life i don't believe any company is creating a bad product i believe you individually might select a good company's product that is bad for your gut you want me to repeat that i believe there is no bad company out there that creates a nutritional supplement what i do genuinely believe is that people choose these good products but that product is physiologically bad for your body so it's no one size that fits all okay um [Music] nandini says i've had quite a bit of success with the kua program thank you ryan you're most welcome nandani and thank you for stating that on a public forum every day i get up in the morning asking myself should i be a celebrity nutritionist should i teach 50 of my dietitians at quad nutrition the reason i do what i do is because one ryan can serve about 200 clients a year i want to serve 200 million people in india right now we are only 50 dietitians the way to go forward is for everyone who watches our videos who enrolls in acquire nutrition program to become brand ambassador to convince people to discover their own kwa kwa in latin means incapacity discover your own capacity for exercise discover your capacity for thinking discover your capacity for sleeping discover your capacity for nutrition what to eat when to eat how much to eat somebody asked me about intermittent fasting is it good it's individual intermittent fasting works very badly for me it gives me acidity my wife has got the most amazing results with intermittent fasting in the last three years as have many of my sports clients when they went into the lockdown all right we've gone really really long today it's been a one and a half hour session i would like to thank my team at kwan nutrition for a great job in 2021 um for you uh coming in over here rashmi anubhav and ridhul thank you so much for helping me out on this live to the rest of my dietitians who are listening in thank you for being the healers in this country i don't know if people know this but i consider dietitians as angels who are put on this planet to change the way you eat whilst you will have a devil and you will have an angel on your shoulder you should eat that cake you should not eat that cake you should eat that cake you should not eat that cake well it's not two kicks it's two personalities inside of you by going in for nutritional counseling sessions and just talking to a person one on one you will change your behavior have you ever remembered in school when your teacher took you aside and said ryan you're not studying hard enough if you studied harder and did not look at all the girls you would be a much more smarter student i got that advice i didn't listen to much of it maybe if that teacher had persevered a little bit more i wouldn't be looking at the girl so much and studied a little harder you know you get the point so i want you to enroll with my nutritionist with my dietitians because after school you're not accountable to anybody think about it after 22 years of age are you accountable to anybody you have your own salary you do everything yeah once you get married you're accountable to your spouse your better half mostly husbands are accountable to their wives i don't think it's vice versa we may not the home ministers finance ministers they control everything if you're a guy who's uh controlling everything please give me the secrets of what you need to do but jokes apart jokes apart we don't report into anyone so what is the reason that you will continue in 2022 on a diet or an exercise plan ghanta you will do anything nothing you will do after this seminar is over it's gone it's over maybe some 10 15 people are watching this i don't even know sometimes why i do this stuff but i do this stuff because i'm hoping that one person turns out to be fardeen khan who watched a video of mine and then met dr ali irani and he said you know what go to ryan fernando he'll help you in a transformation i i am waiting i am waiting for you guys to see his transformation when his movie launches next year so with that i leave you with a word of wisdom do not try to do it yourself recruit your family recruit your friends recruit a trainer recruit a nutritionist recruit a mind coach that's what you need to do in 2022 you're born with only one vehicle that's yourself you can upgrade it you can't change it get on the bandwagon upgrade it in 2022 god bless you and have a great year ahead all my wishes to everyone out there and thank you so much for being a fan thank you so
