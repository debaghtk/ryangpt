[0.16 - 6.28] most of these apps most of these
[2.32 - 8.96] startups where the nutrition is led by
[6.28 - 11.36] technology is wrong in today's Dage
[8.96 - 14.16] maybe 3 4 5 years from now when AI
[11.36 - 15.84] really gets into the bio individuality
[14.16 - 17.92] of a person then it'll be correct so let
[15.84 - 20.28] me give an example most of these apps
[17.92 - 22.56] are funded they are driven is very
[20.28 - 25.00] difficult to invest in technology and
[22.56 - 27.28] get a standardized diet chart created
[25.00 - 28.92] for 10 or 15 patients that walk in every
[27.28 - 31.32] day but what these apps do is they
[28.92 - 33.52] target thousands of people they give one
[31.32 - 35.36] diet chart claimed to be done by
[33.52 - 37.24] artificial intelligence but let me tell
[35.36 - 39.44] you something unless you're capturing
[37.24 - 42.20] your blood test unless you're capturing
[39.44 - 44.16] your food recall your cultural recall
[42.20 - 46.36] your genetic test maybe if you have a
[44.16 - 49.24] little bit more money your microbiome or
[46.36 - 51.64] your gut analysis bacteria test and your
[49.24 - 54.32] omega-3 testing and put all of this
[51.64 - 57.00] together you are actually getting a
[54.32 - 58.76] standardized diet plan but this is good
[57.00 - 60.76] I say that all these apps are really
[58.76 - 63.04] good because at least people are having
[60.76 - 65.32] awareness K by let me at least start
[63.04 - 68.24] something at least here these apps are
[65.32 - 70.28] giving me something of a timetable what
[68.24 - 72.16] to eat when to eat and how much to eat I
[70.28 - 74.92] think if people start that it gets them
[72.16 - 74.92] to a nice place
