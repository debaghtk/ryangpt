[2.60 - 5.88] sleep it's going to help you uh lose
[4.60 - 8.00] weight because that's what happened with
[5.88 - 9.76] my wrestlers and the boxes that are one
[8.00 - 11.48] medals with so when I get them to sleep
[9.76 - 13.40] more than 8 hours I've noticed that
[11.48 - 14.96] their resting heart rate goes down now
[13.40 - 16.28] what happens sleeping 6 hours a day and
[14.96 - 18.56] you're following my diet and all what
[16.28 - 21.12] I've seen is that yes we have a drop in
[18.56 - 23.28] fat percentage but after 6 to 7 Days on
[21.12 - 25.64] the diet and 6 hours of sleep I've
[23.28 - 27.32] noticed that the heart rate goes up why
[25.64 - 28.64] because you're not getting enough of
[27.32 - 30.20] deep sleep and because you're not
[28.64 - 31.56] getting enough of deep sleep then next
[30.20 - 33.96] day the body is saying I have not
[31.56 - 35.96] recovered so I need to pump more blood
[33.96 - 38.00] through your body to deliver nutrition
[35.96 - 39.40] and everything else to these organs of
[38.00 - 41.44] yours that have worked out the previous
[39.40 - 43.44] day have not got its full 6 hour
[41.44 - 45.04] recharge and for that pump more extra
[43.44 - 47.08] blood Therefore your heart rate goes up
[45.04 - 49.40] adrenaline is more and your body's
[47.08 - 52.36] Cravings or requirement of nutrition go
[49.40 - 56.40] up so you get more energy Cravings which
