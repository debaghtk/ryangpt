[1.12 - 4.68] so protection of course the minute you
[2.92 - 6.08] say protection people say SPF right
[4.68 - 7.32] because we are only thinking protecting
[6.08 - 9.76] from the Sun there's so much more to
[7.32 - 11.80] protect from but let's start from SPF so
[9.76 - 13.88] when you pick up sun protection is very
[11.80 - 15.64] important in the sunny hours whether you
[13.88 - 17.68] are indoor whether you're outdoor
[15.64 - 19.56] whether there's a cloud cover you need
[17.68 - 21.36] sun protection if the Sun is up and
[19.56 - 23.32] giving you light if there is day you
[21.36 - 25.16] need sunscreen so that's number one now
[23.32 - 28.08] how do you choose the sunscreen right
[25.16 - 30.56] you need to look at a number called SPF
[28.08 - 33.16] which is sun protection fact factor
[30.56 - 35.80] which means 1 SPF will give me 10
[33.16 - 39.36] minutes of safety Under the Sun so if it
[35.80 - 41.68] is 50 SPF ideally I will get 50 into 10
[39.36 - 43.76] 500 minutes of safety now do I really
[41.68 - 45.56] get that maybe not because to get that
[43.76 - 46.92] there is a certain quantity of sunscreen
[45.56 - 49.04] that we need to apply which most of us
[46.92 - 50.68] don't so every third fourth hour you can
[49.04 - 52.28] reapply the sunscreen if you're really
[50.68 - 53.80] out in the sun if you're in the shade
[52.28 - 56.80] maybe not that many times again and
[53.80 - 56.80] again
