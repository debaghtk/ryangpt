have you today and I want to dig deep into your journey in the Fitness World welcome to my podcast and thank you for coming all the way here thank you so much Ryan for having me and I'm super excited to be here I heard you just caught a flight in from Bal and landed in right so what's happening in bopal Yasmin Karachi Wala in bopal yes we're starting a Pilatus studio in bopal and uh we're partnering with them and yesterday was the soft launch of that your journey has been extensive did you start off as a Pilatus instructor what was your story and cuz it's many years in the making of your Empire so it's a really uh different story I was a very different person as a teenager I was super lazy I never worked out I hated the idea of moving physically I would watch TV and uh eat samosas and bajas and once again you would eat s Bas and all of that piz and I could eat a full Pizza just by myself what was the switch there wasn't really a switch that happened uh when I was around 17 my best friend 18 my best friend fell in love and she wanted to look good and lose a little bit of weight and we just had this new health spa that had opened in our city in in bandra where I live called 10 the Health Spa which had uh saa's team and they had a a very unique membership in like I'm talking about n late 1980s where they said two for the price of one and we were in college couldn't for it no she forced me I had no intention of going she was like because she didn't want to pay the full price she was like there's this amazing you know why don't you join with me I said exercise me not happening she said come on you you eat eat more than all the boys we know you don't move at all I think you should come with me and if you're my best friend and you love me you'll do this so there I went you know emotionally back blackmailed my my best friend went into the studio she knew exactly what she wanted to do uh she went into the weight section started doing some leg extension I didn't even know what those machines were I was walking around I saw this uh Studio where people were dancing it said aerobics and and as a teenager I thought I was a great dancer mhm I walked in thinking I've totally got this went and stood right in front entered late went and stood right in front and front of the mirror because I wanted to check myself out did everything wrong uh because I realized that I had no coordination skills that are required for aerobics probably kicked a few people or B B B bumped into a few people uh finished the class and they all gave me the dirtiest look and they were like you don't belong here what are you doing here I was so embarrassed and disappointed in myself that I kept going back to that class because I wanted to prove to myself that I can't be so bad at something and one day the instructor was unwell she called me up and in those days we had phones at home right no mobile she called me up and she said can you teach my class today I'm not feeling well and I was shocked I said what do you you mean teach your class I don't know how to teach aerobics and she said there are cassettes this was the cassette age just play any cassette you like and do whatever comes to your mind said okay I went I put in a cassette I said hey guys I'm teaching the class today and they all laughed and they said yeah right like we're now going to do rubbish I put the cassette and to my astonishment and the people who I was teaching I knew the entire 10 song routine like every song Every Beat I could even uh instruct them because in my memory subconscious i' I'd heard the teacher so many times that I was giving instructions at the end of the class I think more than the people being surprised I was surprised that I could teach the full class and they said when did you learn and I said I didn't she just that was the start of your journey that was the start of my journey not really after that the instructor actually the instructor was um pregnant that's why she couldn't make it and she was teaching an afternoon class so she said after college would you like to come and teach this class I'll pay you said okay and yeah that that's how it started so I would go to college I would come back earn this pocket money and then after I completed graduation and then I got hooked I would go to that class every day you know show off uh and when I was going to the US after I completed graduation for a uh I was working at we had something called Camp America where Indians would go to America and work in summer camps and you'd get paid so I was going there and she said why don't you go uh do a course because in those days nobody was certified in India and of course my confidence always took the better of me I said yeah I could teach a class without being trained I can go to a course how difficult can it be it was Bloody difficult if I can say so I failed because your passing percentage is 75 plus and we are used to 35% this is the Pilatus of course no this is aerobic instructor training so even aerobic instructor training in the US is a 75% pass yes so the first time you took it little lightly yeah I took it very lightly and you needed to know Anatomy uh I was a Arts student at at uh graduated in economics I knew nothing about the gastro nus it took me 3 Days To Say the word and I love saying it now because I had to PR gastro gastro gastro so it was it was really funny but I went back and red the exam and of course got certified came back uh my dream was to be a school teacher to teach little kids I love toddlers so I came back I did my Early Childhood care and education I used to teach in a school in the morning and run aerobic classes in the evening till I had my own children and then I realized that I used up all the patience that I had in my school that when I came home I didn't have enough for my older son I had only one then and I would be impatient and I said okay this is not fair so I stopped teaching and then I did a personal training course so I thought okay I'll go to people's houses and do personal training and then in the evenings I would do my aerobic class so then I did a personal training course became a person personal trainer did that for about 8 years and then I had my sec in that time had my second son had this little abdominal fat that I did 100 crunches I did a thousand crunches I could never get rid of started researching on the internet what can I do to get rid of my abdominal uh flab and out came the word Pilatus which I was like what is this pilots and then I researched which are the best Studios how do I do teachers training found the studio in the US so this was first for you personally of course okay everything is always first for me okay I come on top of the pyramid and then I found Pilatus and I called up the school first I saw the word Pilatus and then saw who in India teaches Pilatus and nobody did then I found a school in America and I said I want to become a Pilatus instructor it was in California and they said oh great how many years of uh practice do you have and I said zero and they said the prerequisite is that you have to be you have to be practicing Pilatus for a year before you can come and do the course the course and I said nobody in India teaches Pilatus so they sent me some DVDs and they said watch this practice for you know a few months at least I saw it the rollup looked like a situp the chest lift looked like a crunch and I called them I said I do all of this why are you telling me to practice this you know I'm from India I do yoga I teach you know I'm a personal trainer by then I was a personal trainer for about 15 years where was this in the US California in uh Orange County ah okay uh yeah so I packed my bags they said listen we want to just warn you it's tough and how long was the first says tough to me something lights up like there's a light bu pulp that goes up saying I've got this if someone says tough means I have to prove that I can do it even more uh how long was it well I went to do matte Pilatus because I didn't even know what equipment Pilatus meant or what equipment was so I signed up for Matt Pilatus which was 6 weeks so Yasmin for the uninitiated out there what is matte Pilatus and what is equipment Pilatus and is there any other Pilatus so matte Pilatus is Pilatus on a mat you don't require any props you can just do Pilatus like you do yoga on a mat with if unless you're doing aanga or you know something else it's just the mat and you which is what I went to do Pilatus in itself is the perfect combination of strength and stretch uh equipment Pilatus is Pilatus done on an equipment the equipment is what you have to import from all over from the US right now basically and you do it on different equipments which were made by Jo Joseph Pilatus who was the founder of Pilatus ah so there was a person who founded Pilatus and his name name was Josephus okay is it true I read somewhere that uh it was designed for patients and hospitals it was designed during World War I okay uh when uh Joseph patus was in an internment camp he was working with injured soldiers and there were these soldiers after the war without a limb with without two Limbs and he started developing this program for them to keep just keep healthy keep fit build their immunity so they would be on their beds and he would use the Springs of the beds to make them do exercises and Rehab ah and that's how the machines came in and if you look at the machines all our machines Pilatus machines are spring based like in that time they had bed springs very interesting so it was developed by a man for men and you were in California Orange County Learning the matte Pilatus I was I went there to learn the Matt Pilatus a 6 we course my kids were that was in 2006 they were 6 and 8 so my in-laws came in to live with them while I went to do this and when I went the first day I was jet lagged I went I did my course went back and slept the second day I was a little more alert I went at it so it was the first half of the day that they did the math training and then after that they were doing the equipment training the second day I stayed back to see what are they doing when I go home and I saw the equipment and I fell in love I was like I have to bring this back to my country and so I went and met the teacher and I said I want to do this he said well you've just signed up for Matt and you've already missed two days of equipment I said I'll make it up I'll do extra classes and whatever so he said but the equipment training is 12 weeks I had already booked my tickets so I called up my in-laws and I said I want to do this training and the instructors allowed me to break it up 6 weeks now 6 weeks come back after 6 months and so they said and that's when you have supportive you know family and they said beta whatever you want to do you do you go back and do it that was so beautiful yeah so that's how my journey began for pil arst so when you said that you saw the equipment and you said you have to bring this back to the country what was clicking in your head at that time is it that you were already a personal trainer You' done aerobic classes taught aerobic classes and you saw something because today you have many studios you have many people have trained under you right but at that moment as an entrepreneur I don't think you were an entrepreneur were you an entrepreneur that time no but then you said I had to bring it back to India so why what was the trigger the thing with me Ryan is when I like something or when I love something and I see something different and when I use it and I know how effective it is I want to share it with people and which year was this 2006 and at that time Pilatus was unknown in India yeah nobody knew what it was so it was it was actually a gamble but I like gambling I like gambling with health and did you import the first Pilatus reform EV what did the custom say to you when they got that equipment did they pass it through it was yeah you had to just pay custom duty I'm thinking they were like why was this lady importing this bed with spring thing is I actually acquired an import export license to import this machine the machine anyway is expensive in America but by the time it comes to India it's double the cost so I told them which is the cheapest reformer that I can import uh the customer doesn't care and if you're paying your duties you can get in whatever but you have to be willing to so I imported one machine which was a combination of the reformer and the Cadillac and I imported the W chair so I imported these three things because I had to also go back to do my exam to do the rest of the course so I was like if I come back to India how will I practice what I've learned because when you do the second half you have to give an exam so that they know that you've you know done you've learned successfully before you indulge in the advance so I had to bring it back back I had to practice on myself we had teacher training hours that we had to put in where you practice on different bodies and you know You' learn how to train because we have a two-fold uh ex examination one is a written three-fold one is written one is they tell you exercises and you perform them and one is a whole hour where you're teaching somebody else and they observe you teaching them so so it's not an easy exam to pass not at all not at all are there different levels in Pilatus to become an instructor there a basic level and so what are those so the first level is Matt Pilatus which is really really important for you to do because that is like your foundation right so your foundation has to be super strong for you to construct a building and then you do reformer after reformer you do chair after chair you do Cadillac and then you do the barrels and once you've done this all you give an examle ination and you become a comprehensive trainer but you can also be different levels of trainer so now that I'm a teacher I'm I'm a master instructor where I train my trainers I only do match with some people who don't have the luxury of having equipment so they do only maths then with maths we add props so you can do maths with a ball you can do it with terab bands you can do it with teral loops and then you do reformer so there are different levels where you train people um even in Matt we have mat 1 2 3 so if you just want to start out your Pilates career you do mat one you start teaching you get the experience you come back you do Mat 2 and are these examinations conducted now in India yes by you conduct these examinations and right now I'm is there any paper leaking happening in this examinations and all no so how good do you have to be to become a a Pilatus INR so the thing is paper leaking sorry to cut you but the paper leaking can it's an open book exam ah it's an open book exam open book exam the theory is something else but your practical how are you going to cheat so the reason I I went in that direction is because there are two people that need to hear this one is I want to become a fitness instructor and the other is I want to be trained by a fitness instructor so so a lot of women you're very inspirational to a lot of women two children two boys you went to the US your family support is there but a lot of women do not take care of their bodies and doing workouts is one great asset in my opinion that a woman can give back to her body which is the time for herself to take care of her body and the workout is one so for those who are getting inspired by you I want you to know what what was some of the early challenges you talked about you know traveling jet lag and all but those are uh maybe logistical uh challenges what are the other challenges you faced as a woman was money difficult was time difficult was uh people's commend difficult was um like oh you know how can you take care of two children and go for classes did you face some of these issues so I think the biggest challenge comes from your spouse sometimes because he says you have no time to do this and you have no time to do that but as women we are gifted with being multitaskers right we manage our time so from an early age I knew that I wanted to give my kids quality instead of quantity I was never that mother who woke up and dropped them to school to feel that importance or who would want to hear when I'm abroad that my kids are missing me you know I've always made my boys independent and come to me when you have problems and you need me I'm always there so even when I started working I worked my schedule around them I would be home when they left for school I would be home when they came back from school so the first Studio that I started was in my house in my living in my guest room so that's a pivotal moment in your life just adapting everything your desire to be a career woman and at the same time be a family woman you had them kind of so I would like to say Ryan into this that my career goals were being a teacher they were not being an instructor right my my whole like from the time I remember what I wanted to do it was teach children and that's what I gave up when I had my own children because I felt like I was not giving my children quality mhm because when I came home I didn't have patience but I had patience for other people's children right and then I decided okay now that I'm home let me become a personal trainer because Fitness is a second choice that I've made and that became my career because as I went and you know this being a you know nutritionist being into the health space the more you go into Health there's so much you need to learn there's so much you need to try and test there's so it's not about okay I've done this course now I can train paper right it's not like you can do a certification and then you know everything and you can be there as people change as people have different needs you have to constantly evolve you have to constantly uh dive deeper into what you know to know more so I'm constantly finding out what it is that will help the current body in front of me is there a difference when you say you know you have to constantly certify yourself or Healthcare is a deep dive pit because you learn something and then something else is a deeper part of that science is there a difference between just being a fitness Pilatus instructor teacher teaching oneon-one or a class and is there a difference between being a teacher definitely so we have this when when I did this uh certification caused by Fletcher um we learned who is Fletcher Fletcher is a school of Pilatus ah so Ron Fletcher was a pupil of Joseph Pilatus okay and he started his own school and uh he said I mean when I was doing the Fletcher uh teacher training my instructor there my teacher there said you first start out as a trainer you teach what you know like like in the circus you train the animals you're training whatever you know then you become an instructor so from a trainer you've become an instructor now you know the instructions you're giving have to make sense to people so from the knowledge that you know now you've you've taught that taught that taught that now you're going to start instructing differently and then you become a teacher after you become an instructor for a period of time now you become a teacher when now you're sharing your knowledge with other people like now I'm a teacher so I share my knowledge with other trainers to become instructors and then teacher so it's constantly evolving so sharing knowledge we know that you live in Bombay Bollywood comes to you uh we see your Instagram profile with the who is who of Bollywood Who coming to you uh take us back in time where you got your first celebrity I think I was teaching arobics then though I always say it was Karina Kapoor but now when I recall she was my first personal training celebrity client but when I used to do aerobic classes which was step aerobic classes and I had 20 25 people and I I can't remember the first I think no it was Anita Raj okay Raj was my first celebrity and she was sweating in your aerobic class in my aerobic class and she had come out with a yoga DVD ah because she and then I remember thinking oh my God she has her own DVD and she's come to workout with me and it was a it was a super high for me that I'm going to Now train some so that was one of your first highs that was my first high like oh my God Anita Raj is coming to work out with me we're very good friends today but yes she was the first celebrity that came and then of course after that I had a lot of them coming in but obviously you know the celebrities have this mindset that uh my body is the most expensive real estate and they invest in their food their diet their nutrition the trainers the masio even their doctors um in the group of Bollywood who do you think has the most expensive real estate not the land that they buy in Bombay but who do you think really spends and invest your time effort mental grit into getting that great great asset of a body I think we have a lot of them right now there's no one person and why do all of them have that Yas and why does a common man always have this excuse oh is it about money or is it is a mindset so it is a mindset which needs to be supported with money wise words right so it is so to those people that say I say all of us who are health professionals who have these people coming also have a parallel line on our YouTube which is free mhm right like we you have your podcast you're not charging people to watch your podcast it's there for you to learn you have your online videos I have my online videos I have my YouTube videos that I take a lot of time and effort to make for the common man so I'm I'm like we are coming to you but you have to make that effort to come to us you cannot say like of course we get trolled on our Instagram by saying or celebrities I say no every person is a celebrity in their own right and for me you are but you need to take that effort to make that decision for yourself that I'm going to invest in my health and it's not a monetary investment all always because people like you and me who are true uh Believers in our in our work we are there for the common man as well free of cost they need to make that step towards us so I think it's a mind shift and speaking of Investments and mind shift in the wellness industry as a Pilatus trainer when was the investment or the aha moment you said that I'm going to start making this as a business and I'm going to start making it bigger or scale up you remember any specific timelines no it just organically organically happened so for me my aha moment actually was the day I started a studio in my Terrace you first said you started in the bedroom right no in my guest room in the guest room so I'll tell you this is a really interesting uh Journey that I had I became a personal trainer after my boys were born right so I said okay now I can work at at my own time so I used to go to people's houses to train them this was back in the early 2000 and I would go to people's houses to train them and come home and then go to somebody else's house and train them and come home what I realized was people weren't serious about me going to them because your personal trainer is just an extension of your shauer or your uh Doby that you're paying a lot more but they have to work at your time so if you could get a really I was training men and they got a really important call I had to wait for them while they finish their call if I was training women and the subzi Wala came or the doobe came or the driver came I had to wait for them till they finish their conversation it wasn't like okay this is my w that this individual has come to train me that I need to give them my focus time right and I hated that feeling they didn't value my time so I told my husband we had just mve it into our our own flat our nuclear family flat and we had a guest room I said do you mind if I call people home instead of me going to their house because now they coming to me I can set the rules right I'll have to say for 1 hour please put your phone on silent and respect my time he was and I and he was like are you crazy what are you going to now call people to our house and I said you know the kids are so little and I'll always be home for them and that was the that yeah that was the yeah so he was like of course yeah I think that's a great idea so I invested in a few equipment I turn my guest room into a studio I was always home the boys were very little then they were 2 and four literally two and four so I was all that stay-at-home mom doing my own business people would come in if they needed me and that's when I grew and then I said okay you know what we have a Terrace flat my dream is to have a studio on my terce flat which I knew the Builder and I told him this is what I want to do and he said give me a few years to work it out for you in about 2 years I got this tce and that was my dream that was my aha moment but that was actually the start of the journey before we jump back into this conversation with Yasmin I'd like to thank our sponsor Cure by Design and highlight one of the

the link in the description so Ryan you've been asking me all these questions about myself but I also have a few questions of my own to ask you please go ahead what was your journey like well my journey has just been very simple um I always sold nutritional supplements as a scientist as a food scientist as a nutritionist okay and when we sold these nutritional products uh people said by bolo Dal chavel Roti Calen so I always had this team of dieticians with me so I had more dietitians and salespeople and over a period of time I realized hm people are actually willing to pay for the knowledge on how to construct their food which they have learned to eat out of love and culture from their parents and now they want a little science to come into it because they going to the gym they're going to people like you they're working out like crazy but then they're going back and eating whatever culturally has been assigned to them and sometimes that's not working in an aggressive program where you want your body to behave in a certain way whether it's fat loss it's muscle building or you have diabetes hypertension people work out they say exercise helps a medical condition or a lifestyle resolution but then the diet is really like not keeping Pace with the times so I started uh my chain of quan nutrition clinics and that's where I got started in terms of scientific practice with sports people first so some of my first athlet were a similar aerobic instructor Like You by the name of daas who did the Guinness World Record of non-stop aerobics of 26 hours so I was a person that actually wrote down her entire nutrition plan for a year because you've got to prepare the body you can't suddenly turn up as a personal trainer or in a fitness class do very very heavy loads and intensity without having your nutrition backing you and that's the subject of Sports Nutrition how long back was that was about 2006 when we did the Guinness World Record of non-stop aerobics and then 2008 I won an Olympic medal with sushil Kumar I did his diet plan for the bronze medal at Beijing and we followed that up in the next Olympics with a silver medal at the London Olympics so the trainers would be taking the nutrition plan from me uh or they would be the trainers to the Olympic level Superstars or athletes so they knew that Ryan Fernando would be prescribing the diet would be balancing out the blood test the genetic test uh the food allergy test and then Ryan would also look at the supplement strategy the nutritional supplementation so over a period of time the film stars would also work out with these supremely gifted trainers because they were the best in the industry right and they knew that they needed to get a Sports Nutrition diet and they knew that they would come to Ryan Fernando so my journey started with a lot of the Bollywood and the Superstar celebrity athletes calling me up saying that we need your nutrition plan and it was pure word of mouth so people always ask me oh you're a you're a celebrity nutritionist and I always go back and say the famous people knew me but the rest of India did not know about it and I think the reason behind this was that the price that astute people wise people people that are chasing their dreams and goals they put a certain value to what they put into their body and they realize that what they've been taught in society may not be the right version of food to enter the body and so they start hunting who's this person we need to go to change the way we eat and that's how half of them uh land up at our clinics and then we start writing a nutrition plan on that note I also want to ask you uh I was seeing your podcast on protein powder does and zahan and I share my son and I shared the same protein powder and I've been telling him I find it too sweet I cannot have it and I've been looking for a nons sweeten like a natural because I said you know I want to get a protein powder and put some peanut butter in it to make it tasty but I don't want these flavored protein powders and just then I read I saw your podcast on it and it was everything that I was feeling but not being able to express because I'm not you know a nutritionist and that was really interesting so yasman the simplest thing that you did was understand your qua qua in Latin means incapacity of so you were taking this protein powder which is commercially designed standardized label sweetener flavors and all there's nothing wrong with that maybe if you're an Olympic level athlete but when you are a lifestyle person when you're going to take a product day in and day out right you want the best nutrition going into you do not want the best flavor artificial flavor or the artificial sweetener entering your body so I'm glad you discovered this because this concept and every woman should understand this there's a bioindividual response in each one of us especially in women why women because of your hormones so that's where you know this whole thing starts about wherein if we can get women to understand their blood biochemistry they hor hormonal chemistry their menstration cycle and then what life cycle they are at college girl first job just married trying to get pregnant pregnant first second third trimester child is born breastfeeding then weight loss post pregnancy and then the rest of your life in terms of you're having an active menstration cycle then and then menopause then menopause and then postmenopause right so there are all of these life cycles with women which are highly challenging and Inter relatable with your food but if you meet most Indian women their diets remain same as when it was in college so I think that's where awareness needs to get to the next level and I'm really grateful for trainers like you because what happens is in your class you get to meet your client every day and your ly telling them what are you eating what did you eat today so you you said you're not a nutritionist but you're an honorary nutritionist by just asking that question and putting a K in your client's head is there's something that you need to change about the way you eat and that's scientific on that note this is what I felt about myself because like you said just now very truly you eat kind of the same thing right so being a fitness instructor and I'm very particular about what goes in my body I don't eat package Foods I don't eat sugar I don't have dairy I don't have gluten uh and I'll tell you why about that later how I discovered that but I eat the same way and suddenly after menopause I feel like I cannot eat the same way because that eating the same way is not working for me and because I'm not a nutritionist I don't know how I can eat better so just recently in fact earlier in in June I contacted somebody and said hey you know what I need to eat differently and everyone said what's wrong with you how can you eat better than what you eat and I said no my body's needs are different and I need to know because I cannot read a blood report and I don't know what my body requires right and I need that help so I've actually contacted somebody who I know to get that for me in Bombay and I know it's making a difference right that's amazing and uh and coming to pregnancy I know that you uh counseled uh Anushka during her pregnancy please tell me a little bit about that and also on that note later about verat and Shahid being vegetarians and how they get their protein so basically uh I mean verat obviously is one of the best batsmen in the world and um he wanted to up his game the diet game like he's a brilliant eater he's already vegetarian uh he already knew how to eat correctly so there's a self-interest right because you already know that when you eat correctly your focus your concentration your performance your fat percentage your sprinting ability everything is tied into the way you train the way you sleep and the way you eat uh so obviously when verat contacted me this was around the pandemic time um they were isolated and he wanted to step up on his game with nutrition and we worked for many months on the diet plans there's no rocket science you understand a player you understand their fat percentage muscle percentage their blood biochemistry the genetic test if you're lucky you can get a stool analysis which is the poop test and read the microbiome now once you get that a person like me becomes Sherlock Holmes we integrate blood test fat percentage performance metries and all of those things and during this journey um obviously verat researches a lot and he looked at our website and realized that at a quan nutrition clinics I have teams of medical dietitians also and they happened uh to be expecting their their first child and he said can you frame the nutrition plan now what people don't understand is they think that you just have to double calories so today women are getting wiser because of access to information so you can Google up what is a diet for conception what is a diet for the first trimester when you're puking your guts out so obviously the people who are astute have the means will go and find an expert so they ask me can you handle the trimester nutrition plan and we did that very successfully um and um speaking of pregnancy I customize nutrition plants uh I was looking at one of your Instagram posts where you were with earlier but I think so do you also really customize your Pilatus workouts your fitness workouts for each and every client so like nutrition is bioindividual is it the same for fitness and with Alia what was the journey like because you know I get pregnant women coming to us for nutrition plan and they're like can you give me an exercise plan and I'm like I'm not the expert you need to contact an expert and they're like uh but what do we do who should we go to what is it done so tell us a little bit more about Alia's Jour so definitely like nutrition with exercise you have to be very very uh to the point for the trimester that they are at when they're pregnant if they're not we learn and that's what I learned with Pilatus and that's why for me Pilatus is my Bible we train the body in front of us everybody has different needs limitations uh strengths and and we understand that and then we train them with pregnancy I have I have an obsession so I'm constantly doing more and more training with my instructors different experts on pregnancy to know more because there is so much that you cannot know in one training right so I put my instructors through with aliot was really funny and beautiful because she comes to me and she's like yes I'm pregnant but I need to exercise so we customized exercises and we have to make it interesting because now Alia is a person who works out every day right and she doesn't want to be limited with her body or the condition that she is in so we develop exercises on the fitball on the Swiss ball on the reformer I kept changing it because Alia has a very short attention span as well so she can if I do like 20 repetitions I know I've lost her at8 so I make it very crisp her workouts are very crisp risp you have to move before she starts her thoughts go somewhere else Oh I thought I only I did that in my workouts because I actually switch off in my workout and so that's the job of the trainer to pull you back in to know to know each individual's personality ah right there are some people who will benefit from repetitions because they're not their first four reps are not not even counted it takes them five repetitions to understand the exercise there are some people who switch off after eight repetitions so you have to change it before their mind can switch off so this is actually where the personalization happens I just understood it that a trainer can have all the knowledge about the dumbbell the reformer bed Zumba boomba whatever it is and they can be like great with Anatomy but if they don't understand the personality of the client then there's something missing but I think this is also because of the like I said I love doing uh training courses right I love learning more and every time I learn I learn something new like I remember the first Pilatus um training I did I had met other instructors it was their second or third training from a different school and the Pilatus training is one of the toughest trainings I've done I've done a diet plans for few of the Pilatus students who go for these and you know the timing of what has been given to your guys in terms of practice and study and Performing is brutal and intense it both on the mind and the muscle yeah so I would meet these people who had done that they were on the third uh instruction course I be like why would you do this again like this first one but now after having been certified by three different schools of Pilatus I understand the why it's because you learn something completely different from every school of Pilatus and now that I'm writing my own Pilatus manuals I'm using all three schools to make something which is unique do you feel your 30 years of experience is enough or would you like to go back in time and ask for more experience my 30 years of experience is not ended it's still ongoing so no so you're saying that even as a teacher you have to keep learning I I love to learn there's so much that I still don't know and when you're learning or practicing or teaching do you get ideas for your pupils or students on the spot of course I would be doing one machine and then suddenly I'm like like sometimes when I'm making them do an exercise I feel like it's not working like something's not working and I need to switch it it could be a well researched exercise that I do day in and day out but at that point that body is not reacting to me and that's what makes me change it like say I was training you and I was making you do feet and straps which is an exercise you do beautifully and you've done it for maybe the last 10 sessions but on that particular day maybe because you've not slept well maybe because you just come back from a trip your body is not reacting to it for various you're you're feeling a bit under the weather I'm seeing how your body is moving and I know that okay this exercise today is not working for you and I have to change it so 30 years plus of experience Family Support they're your backbone were your parents instrumental in your fitness journey uh and do they walk the walk and talk the talk or this was self-inspired my parents influence me subconsciously because my dad we used to live at Ali in Bombay which is close to the race course and my dad was an avid Walker in the race course and sometimes he would try like I said I was a lazy kid so would try to take me and I had to run to keep up to his walking because he was such a fast Walker and I hated it so my dad every day Come Rain shine whatever even in the rain even in the rain he would be at the Mahal lakmi race course uh walking two rounds which is like some 7 8 km uh and then as he Grew Older he would walk 10 km my mom used to do yoga we lived in haeli and in those days we had one car so Dad would take the car to office mom would take a bus and go to uh Cho party and do yoga there and I thought my parents were crazy like I couldn't understand why they were making such a big deal about exercising they both look pretty good but I think that kind of discipline is what came down the jeans which was a great thing because now I understand that I get it from them subconsciously they were my role models and uh they always told me do something my mom would constantly while I was growing up say do something move exercise go down and play go down and play so yeah speaking of our beloved mothers I constantly try and tell my mom mom I bought her a set of dumbbells recently and Mom you've got to strength train your advice to all the mothers out there especially the mothers our mothers who are of the older generation they don't work out what is yasmin's advice to all the moms out there that every decade like you know and I'm sure you're telling your mom we lose bone density the only thing that prot protects us is our muscle and you need to do some sort of exercise and especially in today's generation and age where we have uh uh sedentary Lifestyles where we're not moving like our mother's mothers did a lot of work they used to do housework they would go to the well to get water they would milk the cows I remember the grinding stone that might used to go on 45 minutes Chuy you know so our mother's mothers did a lot of work like physical work our mothers don't because of course the the luxuries have come in in our generation and there's much later they need to move my mom is 76 my mother-in-law is 82 and they both do Pilatus they need to find a very you know yoga we we are the we are the um what's the word p p not the the birth place of yoga births it in India right and yoga is something that all our mothers can do and if you have the opportunity you can do Pilatus which is so gentle on your bones and my mother at 76 my mother-in-law at 82 do Pilatus and they look fabulous and they feel really good they're energetic they're moving around and also I don't know if you know Helen Khan mhm she started Pilatus at the age of 85 85 5 so what is the core component for all the ladies watching in about Pilatus what is the core component or how do they understand so why do you have diets for people right why do you have nutrition plans to nourish the body patus nourishes your body in terms of physical activity okay and so between yoga and Pilatus I know this is a loaded question and a lady came to you I'm this old lady and I was like Yasmin what exercise should I do I can only do yoga or I have time only for Pilatus only one of them which one should I do I would tell them why don't you do both see which one you love to do and stick to that that's sely advice because it's about if you love it you you you'll turn up more often and then you make it a lifestyle because you have to look forward to exercising also it can't be a burden and a chore so maybe instead of giving you mom dumbbells if you take her to a yoga class or get somebody home to do yoga or a little bit of movement or just some theraband exercises she might enjoy that more mom if you're listening in I'm calling up the the best yoga instructor in go and getting a class for you so don't Grumble Madame Yas you have to try yoga Pilatus uh just some freestyle like calisthenics you have to try different things to see which one she enjoys but most of the old people hit back to saying oh we're too old now this is not meant for us if we had to do it we should have done it in our younger years you're never too old to take care of yourself what are the common mistakes that people make when starting a fitness journey that you have seen doing something because it's set to be good for you not finding out what you enjoy to do and what's really good for you but you're telling people do p artist do yoga so then they turn up for it but what are the what are the things that they could expect that could that could discourage them to do too much too fast like people watch the internet now and Instagram like they're seeing people doing these fancy Pilatus moves and they come to class and they show the instructor and they say but is your body ready for it is your foundation strong enough like I said Matt patus is foundation do you have the foundation to do that exercise that's what's important don't see exercises on the in internet because people have mastered that and then they're showing it off you know I have a confession over here I do karate I've been doing it for many many years and I started a new style and I found one of India's best martial instru martial arts instructor he handles the Indian team and I wanted to do something known as a Kata which is a pre-form style or dance and he's like that is for a black belt you are only an orange belt uh you cannot learn that right now and it struck me at that moment if weight training Fitness Yoga Pilates had colored gradiation belts in it we could take people on a journey slow and steady where they knew they had to earn the next belt but speaking uh speaking of earning their belts we've got the celebrity superstars who are black belts in their life you've got uh deika paron Katrina C how does their worker out differ from a normal person's workout or is it the same it's the same it's just that their needs are different like how like if like when Katrina had to do chickney cham the dance and she was doing this vigorous Dance Movement where her no fat could jiggle and she said yes if anything Jiggles I'll go on national TV and say you're not a good instructor wow so then the workout gets customized to make sure that because people also troll you for silly things not realizing I got trolled yesterday uh with a picture I with some video I put up and they were like oh you also have a stomach how can you be a Pilatus how can you be an instructor I was like everyone has it's like my hair stylist is bald and I still go to him because he's the best in the world right so and we all have bodies and I just want to say that what you see on Instagram is not reality most of the time we put our best foot forward obviously we want to look good we don't want to show and why would you put up your BST foot on a social media platform right but to troll is just something which we've learned to do without thinking of consequences so when an actor goes on on on on a film set and has to look a particular way they work really really hard and we customize everything for them to look that way for the people who Envy the our film stars who come to us they don't see the background what's an average number of minutes that a person puts in every day for their Fitness regime I would say an actor or a superstar whether it's an athlete or an actor they put in 24 hours into their day to give you what what you're getting right because it's not just their workout it's their workout it's their lifestyle it's their nutrition it all needs to go hand and glove just one thing on its own will collapse it's like all these pillars have to be strong for them to be on the top so they what what you don't see is the kind of work they put in they've had a 14 hour shift where they're shooting and they still come to workout you know after that shift you have to customize their workout according to what kind of a day they've had they are on set the whole day how are they managing their nutrition which you know it's it's not easy right but they do it because that's the investment that they've made in in themselves so that those are the things you don't see what you see is them on screen looking their glamorous self or you're trying to catch them outside a a beauty P or the airport and you know things like that even that has become stressful for them now and that was a that was a famous role and for her to have no fat jiggling anywhere was a testament to your ability to train her can you share some secrets about that work out that were really brutally Intense or was it a cakewalk for her no no it wasn't a cak work for sure I'm just trying to recollect because it was so many years back but it was very we used to work out every day um an hour of workout we used to put in cardio after that the food was very disciplined uh we never did the same workout every day we were doing a lot of functional training which needed to change every day because Katrina gets bored really easily also so we I never do the same workout every day with my clients so I had to come up with new new ways to do the same thing you know if you know what I mean and also it was making sure that if she was shooting how do I put in those hours of training with her without it hampering her performance at work uh on days when she would have had a long shoot we would just do patus but it would be active patus but if she while she was shooting the song we would do passive Pilatus so it was more about rebalancing herself so you were taking the calorie balance like the expenditure was aggressive at a movie set then she came back and rejuvenated her training with you and if it was a day off you would go into intense hardcore workouts I would love to be um a circuit inside your brain right now uh because you customize and design these workouts like a like a computer right you've got all of the experience and it's a code exactly like you what didn't you say Ryan yeah so it is it is what we do but it would be very interesting to pick notes with somebody on how they do it because sometimes I'm just thinking okay Shahid kapor gets up at 4:30 in the morning and then starts his workout Come Rain or sunshine and you see that discipline in people who are very very driven and then he's finished his meditation his prayer his workout everything before his kids get up and then he dresses them up to school and stuff like that so when you look at how you have to manage that uh you have to write down your notes and put things together so it's a lot of manual practice creating a diet plan or an exercise plan now in today's world AI is com in so I've been seeing that AI has been begun to help me research dishes that I never knew about right has AI changed your mindset what do you feel about it providing customized workouts to people and look you and I are Craftsmen of our trade and a lot of people are saying but I can now get an AI diet plan and AI exercise plan where are you in this world right now so at like I said earlier Ryan I'm constantly learning and I'm always eager to learn and at 54 today what I've learned from you is how to use AI so I'm going to now start exploring the world of AI which I haven't yet because I didn't know how to uh but yeah I mean it sounds what whatever you've shown me today before we started this podcast has really uh got my mind ticking as to how I can now work even more efficiently I think that's a key word work more efficiently because uh somebody asked me this question the other days that you think uh you know I can just get an AI driven diet chart but I think the motivational part of your instructor teacher Guru uh nutritionist or fitness instructor whoever that person is the presence of a person the guidance by that person the motivation by that person I think it'll be quite a few number of years before AI can actually take over that part of our Lives it's also like I said earlier you you sense the energy that the person is giving you right sometimes you don't know the energy that you're giving out but your instructor can feel that energy and then modifies the workout according to that you literally have to have a robot AI present uh with sensitivities to feel that for you and you as a trainer I've seen some of your videos you talk highly about nutrition you're one of the few trainers that I've looked at and you've said nutrition is of primary importance you can't uh you know you can't outtrain a bad diet so what are some of the nutrition tips that you guide your celebrity clients with what are the basics that you give over there one thing I like to tell everyone is to not have sugar refined sugar because I've learned this this uh my dad had my dad was discovered with cancer about 11 years back and we took him to Mexico to this health uh Hospital uh Oasis of Good Hope because we didn't want to do chemo with him he was stage three lung cancer and we wanted to change and get him better up and they promised that through nutrition they would change your lifestyle and give you a good quality of life they don't tell you we'll take your cancer away but the life that you have left they promise you will be good quality and that's what happened with him and the doctor there said that sugar is poisoned to your body and when you go for a pet scan they put in an injection and that's glucose which tells your cancer cells it's time to party and they light up so that you can capture that image on the machine and that's the one thing that stuck in my head my dad lived for about 18 months after that it was good quality of life but uh he didn't go out you know with pain and you know he he accepted that I have that much time left he was so that's the one thing for me which is poison which is sugar and that's what I tell my clients and the next thing is eat foods that are alive because you're going to feel alive right so your fruits your vegetables uh you eat a package food which has preservative it's dead it's going to make you feel dead you who can say they had a a packet of Doritos or potato ships and felt great before we wrap up one piece of advice you would give to my audience out there if they were going to start on their fitness journey take baby steps find out what exercise works for your body what exercise you enjoy build a really strong foundation and then take it upwards when you say baby steps are you meaning uh the intensity of that that one day workout or planning it for the whole year and go SL and steady for the whole year no I mean if you're a person who's never exercised and you're starting off on a journey don't suddenly say okay now I'm going to exercise four times a week an hour say I'll exercise twice a week for half an hour get used to it get that into your routine build on that once you start enjoying it once you start seeing results then take a little more then and we we we're both available on the internet if you don't have money find us you know follow the right in exercise routine don't try to suddenly from zero try to go to 50 and say okay now I'll start with squats lunges leg presses deadlifts you know build get your body ready for it so that's pretty much what I'd like to say to people who want to start out that plan it takes take baby steps right but one for you now Ryan uh supplements people say oh I don't take any supplements I recently have discovered the importance of supplements can you share your thoughts on that so supplements I always say this are a nutritional convenience for your nutritional indiscipline now your indiscipline could be genuine that is your body stops absorbing because you're aging or you have a genetic back foot to not absorb that like I have a Calcium deficiency absorption Gene so my body doesn't absorb calcium mil so I need to take a supplement and on the other hand the indiscipline could be because you do not know how to eat correctly or you're abusing your body so supplements are good provided they're taken under medical advice in conjunction with a genetic test and a blood test to know where you lie taking excess amount of any micronutrient be it a plant compound vitamin or mineral research is shown that sometimes it can activate centers of growth including cancer so you might be aiming for muscle growth beautiful skin growth but could you also activate uh anomalies inside of your body so this whole concept today where startups have come and left right and Center people have supplement companies and people are prescribing supplements and with due respect to anybody who's influencing or advertising supplements out there you are not qualified to understand how that supplement would interact in your client's body in fact doctors do not study about nutrition in Medical College and therefore their training on drugs is Paramount in medicine but it's not nutriceutical and therefore their idea of vitamins minerals amino acids is trained in later years by the pharmaceutical industry who approaches them for the general range of Nutri nutriceuticals multivitamins which is why you see doctors saying okay you can take this product of nutrical origin but only for two or three weeks then stop but what if there's a condition that requires you to take a nutriceutical supplement lifelong you only come to know this with repeated blood biochemistry tests working with a qualified medical dietician or medical nutritionist and they're tracking you over a period of time and not giving you Mega doses of supplementation a lot of nutritional companies like in protein powders they say you need to take 2 G per kg body weight but not everyone a bodybuilder so why would you take 2 G per kg body weight every day but if you're taking only 30 g of protein a day in your entire diet and you need 70 G then you need a supplement so it's kind of uh when you drive a car the road is open you'll press the accelerator but when there's traffic you're not pressing the accelerator so you need to understand or determine the conditions inside your body and this I advise people to seek professional medical help before they start supplementation and a lot of people now are supplementing because of longevity things like resveratol nadh nmn um you know um aanin one of my favorite molecules but when you're kind of it's like you know imagine people everyone says I know how to cook then you go to the kitchen and you put this Masala that Masala because all masalas are good right you're not even tasting a dish so you're not even doing the blood test you're just putting masalas inside of your body Masala meaning supplements the dish is going to turn out not so good at some point of time gastritis uh you know uh digestive disorders High BP I've had a client once who began taking a fat burner simple fat burner called el cartine but did not know it had an interaction with the thyroid and the day they turned up in my clinic they showed the data and everything I looked at it and I says you're taking a nutritional supplement that you're not supposed to take it's like how do you know we didn't tell it to you it's like it's clearly indicated in your blood test so Sherlock Holmes is there in your blood test so don't take a nutritional supplement without having data on hand on ELC cartin I quickly want to ask you what is your take on wjar and OIC these drugs are designed by the pharmaceutical industry to help medical patients who are at the last mile of literally hopelessness and this is a savior for them now when you produce something you got to find a market for it so you go to all the fat people on the planet and say you know what we know you can't work out you know what we know you can't follow Ryan Fernando's diet you know what you're a failure so you know what take this drug I've been through about four cycles of marketing of different drugs as a student uh as working for supplement companies and then starting my own business and what I observe is that these are fads that last till you get sufficient clinical data coming out by the real life population saying there are amazing side effects and when I say amazing amazing meaning Tupper as I say in my Instagram people are are are are getting side effects that are taking them to hospital so I'm not a huge fan of any of these products because they are not found in nature but if you tell me dalini cinnamon eltin which is found in the human body vitamin B complex which is found in the human body I'm a little bit okay about giving a little extra of this because the side effect you will see it in your body and it's reversible what is the side effect hyperactivity little acidity so like okay pimples acne okay don't take this supplement for you but when it comes to these drugs people are not taking it on doctor's prescription and they're getting side effects and even if your doctor prescribes it I would say to the doctors could you explore diet exercise aggressively by your patient first because we want people to live Healthy Lifestyles and this is so like and you and I both being in this profession we know losing 1 and A2 kilos a week by not doing anything just by it curbing your appetite and I don't know what else what other harm so if you're losing that kind of weight without doing what you and I prescribe imagine the amount of harm it's doing to your insights I think people should explore and doctors should explore these drugs once you have put the client through the regime of 300 workouts in a 365 day and you've done three meals a day into 300 days 900 meals a year on bang and then if you're not getting a result explode drugs otherwise Simple Sleep simple exercise simple diet is the perfect cure the perfect medicine to maintaining a healthier Lifest style so simple simple exercise um you wrote a book on the 10minute workout uh what was the idea over there the idea was to get everyone to move for at least 10 minutes a day the idea was to tap into the population that says I have no time to work out the idea was to not give them an excuse saying I can't read this exercise and do it so now we have a QR code where you uh scan the QR code and you go to a video Library where you're doing the 10-minute workouts with me I'm doing them with you explaining to you I have the timer everything is set all you have to do is put on scan the QR code watch the video and follow me so if somebody wants to reach out to you and wants to do this 10-minute workout or get your advice or watch your YouTube videos or Instagram how do we find you Yasmin karala on Instagram or YouTube
