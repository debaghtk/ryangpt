[50.48 - 57.36] You are completing your workout with the help of car
[53.72 - 60.96] Eating first is just like going on a trip

[73.72 - 81.04] It can be tricky but it also depends on this
[77.52 - 84.68] what exercise you do depends
[81.04 - 88.52] for how long do you do it and your
[84.68 - 92.88] How intense is the workout? Low intensity
[88.52 - 96.48] Exercises such as walking, light jogging
[92.88 - 100.20] or the slow one in steady state cycling
[96.48 - 104.40] Your body primer fats means fat use
[100.20 - 108.36] and what it means for energy
[104.40 - 111.56] Fats are an excellent energy source and
[108.36 - 116.40] For this type of low intensity workout
[111.56 - 119.48] it's very good but when you do high intensity
[116.40 - 122.64] I exercise the whole garden like a race
[119.48 - 125.68] Sprint or intense weight lifting
[122.64 - 128.56] There is no rest in between or it is very less
[125.68 - 133.60] Doing any exercise for long duration
[128.56 - 137.12] if yes then your body needs carbohydrates or
[133.60 - 140.60] Glycogen is used for energy if
[137.12 - 143.28] You should consume carbs properly before a workout
[140.60 - 147.00] If not available, you will have low glycogen stores
[143.28 - 150.12] Because of this, your performance may decrease
[147.00 - 152.20] but some people are fast in their regime
[150.12 - 155.08] Training includes for specific purposes
[152.20 - 158.92] Does it have a benefit of fat
[155.08 - 161.32] of oxidase and metabolic flexibility
[158.92 - 164.36] Enhanced Fastest State in Regular
[161.32 - 167.76] By training you can reduce your body fat
[164.36 - 170.56] to be used as a primary energy source
[167.76 - 173.20] you can increase the ability of
[170.56 - 176.80] Endurance Event or Prolong Duration
[173.20 - 179.44] It will help you a lot in activities and
[176.80 - 181.68] Many metabolic adaptogens are adaptogens to fasting
[179.44 - 184.44] has been associated with e.g.
[181.68 - 186.88] Its insulin sensitivity improves
[184.44 - 189.72] What does it mean that your sugar level is
[186.88 - 192.40] For him insulin is a hormone and for him sugar is
[189.72 - 194.80] when your insulin controls
[192.40 - 197.60] If it doesn't work then it is not sensitive
[194.80 - 200.84] If it happens then this fasting of yours
[197.60 - 203.96] The second thing that fixes insulin
[200.84 - 205.80] What is good mitochondrial function
[203.96 - 209.32] How will this explain mitochondria
[205.80 - 212.52] Do you know brother, mitochondria are present in every cell of yours
[209.32 - 215.92] There is a power generator inside and not one
[212.52 - 218.88] has up to 5000 mitochondria
[215.92 - 221.60] inside a cell so understand this
[218.88 - 224.80] Each mitochondrion is a generator when
[221.60 - 227.88] If you do fasting then it will power the generator
[224.80 - 230.40] The broom helps to clean and tidy up the place
[227.88 - 233.80] Means it improves mitochondrial function
[230.40 - 236.16] Your power output as a result of fasting
[233.80 - 238.76] it improves and the last point which
[236.16 - 241.20] What happens when you fast: Cellular
[238.76 - 244.00] It's like Diwali time for repairs
[241.20 - 246.88] The entire house is cleaned for Diwali
[244.00 - 250.12] Cleansing when you fast Juna
[246.88 - 252.32] What are the old sales?
[250.12 - 254.84] They die when you fast
[252.32 - 257.96] If you do then it is called new sale brother
[254.84 - 260.64] I will look like a boss, I am new, I am complete
[257.96 - 263.96] will use it for the body and the old
[260.64 - 266.44] These are cancer cells, it removes them
[263.96 - 268.60] In English it is called auto phase or
[266.44 - 270.60] spring cleaning so this is a form of
[268.60 - 273.92] Cellular repair good performance
[270.60 - 276.96] To optimize, you can make fasting weak
[273.92 - 280.36] Incorporate Twice Strategically
[276.96 - 282.80] Time with low intensity training like when
[280.36 - 285.24] I do it on Tuesday and Thursday
[282.80 - 288.96] If someone goes for a walk then on this day I
[285.24 - 292.16] He fasts and takes pre-drinks on the remaining days
[288.96 - 295.00] Always eat workout bills before training
[292.16 - 297.84] There is a benefit in bi fasting where
[295.00 - 301.00] When I was with the Sab India cricket team
[297.84 - 303.76] If you prepare a player's diet then take it twice a week
[301.00 - 306.04] We call it fasted state training
[303.76 - 308.52] What is the benefit? The benefit is that
[306.04 - 311.84] This thing is mitochondrial biogenic
[308.52 - 315.88] Understand what happens to your building
[311.84 - 319.92] There are 10 generators inside
[315.88 - 323.92] The generator has become old but all 10 generators
[319.92 - 327.20] If all 10 generators have to be run then eight
[323.92 - 329.96] The generator is brand new and gives full power
[327.20 - 332.04] and this two old generator is broken if
[329.96 - 336.40] Runs slow, doesn't generate much power
[332.04 - 338.80] If yes, then fasting is one way to get energy
[336.40 - 342.80] Closes the source Closes the source of food
[338.80 - 345.56] These 10 generators are generated by stopping the work
[342.80 - 347.72] The new generator is less fuel intensive
[345.56 - 349.88] They struggle, but they work
[347.72 - 352.48] what happens to the old generator
[349.88 - 354.96] I squeeze it, I can't walk, I'm dead
[352.48 - 358.44] it is called in english
[354.96 - 361.48] mitochondrial death so the old cell
[358.44 - 364.48] Spring cleaning of the body happens, right?
[361.48 - 366.84] I went out so fasting really helps
[364.48 - 370.04] in creating new mitochondria and
[366.84 - 372.60] Mitochondria give you strength, so the first
[370.04 - 374.72] Within 10 days, 15 days, 20 days when you
[372.60 - 377.32] You do a lot of fasting training now, right?
[374.72 - 379.72] You won't feel like working out
[377.32 - 381.84] But what happens after that is all new.
[379.72 - 384.64] Broom and mop are the water inside the body
[381.84 - 387.56] The content is fresh and new so now you will get it
[384.64 - 390.04] a lesson of energy so if you start fast
[387.56 - 393.88] state training give yourself two to four
