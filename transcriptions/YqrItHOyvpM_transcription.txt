[26.52 - 32.52] one biohack is you can Earth yourself
[29.72 - 35.82] take off your rubber soles and if you
[32.52 - 38.10] touch grass Earth Stone Granite you will
[35.82 - 39.54] discharge the EMF that is stored in your

[44.58 - 49.62] seconds of being on grass yeah 20 21
[47.58 - 52.62] published studies in the medical
[49.62 - 54.54] literature on earthing and grounding and
[52.62 - 56.64] this is peer review stuff I'm on the way
[54.54 - 58.98] to the airport give tips that are going
[56.64 - 62.66] to help prevent or Shield you from Dirty
[58.98 - 62.66] EMF puranas
[63.86 - 71.28] eat fresh food
[66.80 - 73.92] organic nature whenever I travel I try
[71.28 - 75.72] to eat simple really simple I actually
[73.92 - 77.70] don't go for a lot of vegetables because
[75.72 - 80.40] I don't have the catering at the airport
[77.70 - 82.74] is really good at washing the fruits and
[80.40 - 85.74] vegetables so I go for food that's very
[82.74 - 88.68] very simple the protein in dal and the
[85.74 - 90.90] carbohydrate rice and some pineapple uh
[88.68 - 92.28] to help in digestion the reason is when
[90.90 - 94.50] you're traveling you really can fast
[92.28 - 97.14] like for eight hours but the ideal thing
[94.50 - 100.02] is not to eat something heavy so avoid
[97.14 - 102.18] foods that are raw avoid foods that
[100.02 - 104.46] could give you food poisoning or go for
[102.18 - 107.58] hotter foods go for simpler Foods hey
[104.46 - 109.74] everyone we're at 30 000 feet 30 MF in
[107.58 - 111.90] this cylindrical tube switch off your
[109.74 - 114.30] Wi-Fi when you bought the pulling
[111.90 - 116.58] because it's bouncing off inside this
[114.30 - 119.04] cabin more importantly try and get
[116.58 - 123.12] yourself wired headphones the Bluetooth
[119.04 - 125.82] ones have more radiation final point
[123.12 - 127.32] I use the EMF pristines
[125.82 - 130.38] which you've been doing for the last 15
[127.32 - 133.56] years to predict against your TN if you
[130.38 - 136.32] want to know more keep watching
[133.56 - 138.48] hey so I've just landed now is when I
[136.32 - 140.94] ground because of all the EMF radiation
[138.48 - 144.06] I do this very regularly in fact as I'm
[140.94 - 146.04] making this video I feel so good because
[144.06 - 148.86] my feet are grounded I actually want to
[146.04 - 151.44] take off more and just walk on the grass
[148.86 - 154.32] just to feel good because I can feel my
[151.44 - 156.42] body discharging do this on Stone on
[154.32 - 158.40] granite it's a little bit lesser but if
[156.42 - 160.98] the grass is slightly wet you will
[158.40 - 163.80] discharge much faster and you will feel
[160.98 - 167.30] much more rejuvenated try this tip when
[163.80 - 167.30] you have a long evening ahead of you
