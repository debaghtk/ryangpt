[0.00 - 4.98] I was asked this question at the gym
[1.74 - 7.38] recently Mr Fernando which are the top
[4.98 - 9.48] superhero foods that you would eat for a
[7.38 - 12.18] gym workout and I thought
[9.48 - 14.16] I definitely have amla massively
[12.18 - 16.80] powerful antioxidant
[14.16 - 19.20] pistachios 20 numbers a day in the
[16.80 - 21.42] evening heart has some amazing
[19.20 - 22.86] properties to clean up your block but
[21.42 - 24.42] also has the highest content of
[22.86 - 27.66] melatonin which means it gives you a
[24.42 - 29.16] deeper sleep deeper sleep means more SWS
[27.66 - 30.84] sleep which means more stem release
[29.16 - 33.42] which means my recovery from my workout
[30.84 - 36.00] is better I would do gochi berries
[33.42 - 39.30] apparently Gucci berries have this
[36.00 - 41.94] intrinsic power to help in anti-aging so
[39.30 - 43.86] Muscle Recovery would be better people
[41.94 - 45.72] talk about protein I don't think you
[43.86 - 48.00] need to take extra protein I think you
[45.72 - 50.58] need to take more foods with powerful
[48.00 - 53.10] antioxidants so I would do pomegranate
[50.58 - 55.08] because pomegranate contains beta
[53.10 - 57.12] stetosterol which clear up the arteries
[55.08 - 60.30] because you're going to work out
[57.12 - 62.22] but not all foods can clean up your
[60.30 - 63.96] blood vessels all foods can build your
[62.22 - 66.48] muscle muscle is not your problem
[63.96 - 68.16] keeping your arteries clean is a new age
[66.48 - 70.56] science problem that we are dealing with
[68.16 - 73.14] and the final food that I would put in
[70.56 - 75.24] is butter head lettuce butterhead
[73.14 - 77.76] lettuce has the highest nitrate contents
[75.24 - 80.16] nitrates do vasodilation you get a super
[77.76 - 81.66] pump in your workout I normally have
[80.16 - 83.46] butter head lettuce at my lunch time
[81.66 - 85.64] because my workouts at five o'clock in
[83.46 - 85.64] the evening
