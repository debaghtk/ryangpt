hey guys if you're not able to watch my long form content of podcast here are some short form clips for you to enjoy doctor what are the remedies for acid reflux so my first question to you what is acid reflux and then who are the guys who are going to save us okay acid reflex is basically reflex of the stomach acid back into the esophagus reflex means what it comes back H regurgitation basically it comes back basically the acid should be in the stomach alone but unfortunately something has happened where the spinter muscle there is a muscle at the end of the junction of the fot pipe and the stomach it is supposed to close it's like a gate it's a gate it's a door so if that doesn't close properly the acid comes back out so when you eat food goes inside the stomach the acid is secreted by the stomach and it gets broken down into small pieces correct and then the lots of acid is being secret because we heat a lot so what happens is if this if this door the door closes as soon as the stomach the foot goes into the stomach but if the door is open because acid is secreted acid comes back into the esophagus awesome there's a funny question we got from one of our followers okay my stomach speaking like in third person my stomach not me my stomach is not digesting G or fried foods if I eat those Foods I pass tools with mucus and I get lose motions what should we answer answer to such a follower so maybe he's very sensitive to those foots correct but isn't it common sense you e eat something it's going to slap you you should avoid it uh so there are two parts today one is if you eat more yes that is the so you mean to say that sometimes we can fly under the radar by eating lesser of that correct correct exactly so first thing to this person is that you need to decrease the fried fatty foods whenever whatever he is eating but let's say that he still has the problem in even after decreasing it that is where we say that your stomach is very sensitive we need to fine tune your stomach handhold your stomach and love your stomach back for those who are uninitiated but follow you and follow me what is the meaning of mucus in stools so mucus is the intestinal lining secretes some fluid it's like a sticky when you blow your nose that does it look like that mucus when you blow your nose is it a clear white mucus or is it like when you get a cold which is green mucus so it's usually ELO mucus and then you know we see that while we are doing the procedure colonoscopy so if I poty and I look down I should technically not see mucus with my stool and generally not yes generally not and if I see a lot of mucus it could be a sign of an problem it could be a simple problem like you know irritable bubble syndrome or something like that or it could be a uh relatively more uh um you know complex problem like inflammatory bubble disease like runes disease or alcer is when you were in Medical College were you given stool samples to look at and see what is mucus and what is without mucus and I absolutely lowed it I got a gut feeling I want to really enjoy your profession for the rest of your life absolutely okay so the reason I'm asking these questions is because uh you know oh one one thing it's the most more than mucus the most important thing is blood oh we shouldn't see blood right Whenever there is there are two types of blood right fresh blood and old blood or something like that H can you tell us about that yeah so more than mucus blood and stool is considered as a red flag so fresh blood would look like red blood huh so blood stool is could be bright red yes what what is that problem like most likely it is hemorrhoids you got to understand that we can get skin problems inside our gastrointestinal system and it could bleed yeah yeah so what if I bleed in the stomach then the color of my stool changes to Black so if I look at black and and when we're talking about black what is black like this black like my hair like the mic black no my I don't have hair but still if you have or this might black it turns that black dark so normally stool is brown in color light brown dark brown the reason that is black is if there is a bleeding in the stomach the acid digests the blood which is red in color that turns into black and comes down the intestine so those of you who got a black tongue and black sto will see Dr Paul immediately no see a good doctor locally as well we don't need to wait for him to fly down to America but these are things that people actually never discuss at the dining table or in families like I would share something very intimate with you and the followers around 10 years ago I had hemorrhoids and uh it was one and um you know I took a lot of turmeric supplement and lot of Omega and lot of protein powder no fiber and I guess I started getting blood in my stools so I kind of got it treated uh with the rubber band kind of thing and it the doctor explains it's a very harmless procedure and got it done very interesting is why am I telling everyone about this is when I went to my mom and I said I'm going in for a medical procedure which is very simple and I'd be out in 2 hours she said I also have hemorrhoids like okay uh your grandfather also had it and then I was like what about your brothers and sisters I never asked them so I picked up the phone and started calling all my uncle and aunties and Chacha and chachis and everything and guess what Dr pal everybody everybody had it and everyone was silent about it so is it true that people don't discuss their bowel M and gut problems and it's it's a very like a taboo topic yeah absolutely and that's why I combine humor into this very taboo topic what's your biggest joke to to a patient on the table I said welcome to the office of gut and butt gut and butt almost like beis in buttthe head hey guys if you've enjoyed this clip then click here and watch the full episode and don't forget to subscribe because your body is
