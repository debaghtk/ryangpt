We frequently hear about cases of people, usually young, fit people, getting cardiac arrests/heart attacks during or after a gym session, participating in sports, or running a marathon.

Such incidents make us question if exercise is actually having an impact on our heart health?

Celebrity Nutritionist Ryan Fernando, along with Shwetambari Shetty, Fitness Expert at CureFit interacted with Dr. Aashish Contractor- Director- Dept of Rehab Medicine and Sports Medicine, Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital, to know his expert views on the matter.

A balanced diet can lower your chance of developing cardiovascular disease, prevent weight increase, lower your risk of diabetes & high blood pressure, and maintain your cholesterol levels, which are significant heart disease risk factors.

Transcript: 2020 and 2021 we saw a lot of people corporate ceos running on treadmills and collapsing of heart attacks and i thought who better than to invite dr ashish who's the race medical director in the mumbai marathon so if any any marathon happens and we are running over there dr ashish is the guy that's saving our life uh hopefully you don't get a heart attack when you run so ashish my first question to you doc is that is it okay to exercise in 2022 thanks ryan you know it's it's actually quite quite sad and quite ironic that over the last year because we've had these unfortunate events we are being asked the reverse question normally people should ask or is it bad not to exercise how can i or my loved one exercise and today over the last year year and a half people are asking the question in reverse um so give me a couple of minutes to talk on this subject because it's something which you know you can't have a one-liner on and ironically since the last four five months i've done probably ten different podcasts and events such as this around this subject and yours let me distill it down for you exercise is absolutely fabulous if we could put all the benefits of exercise into a pill it would probably be the best selling pill ever okay apart from your heart stroke cancer pretty much every chronic disease known to man exercise reduces your risk of getting it and in god forbid you have got it exercise improves your quality of life and reduces your chance of it becoming worse that's enough in a nutshell okay having said that exercise does not provide immunity against heart attack and death and this is where people make a mistake just because someone is exercising does not mean they cannot have an event since we are talking about the subject of heart there are different risk factors which contribute towards a person having a heart attack okay the usual ones which i'm sure you've spoken about several times in the past smoking diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol heavy weight genetics and last is lack of exercise so obviously if you're exercising you're getting rid of one risk factor that doesn't mean that you cannot have now all these people who unfortunately died young i cannot comment on what their risk factors were because i do not know it but i just want to say that just because you're fit does not mean you have immunity you have protection but not immunity and that's what people need to understand one one final point when people who are very well known have an event it also makes disproportionate views in the headline when people are exercising and they have an event it makes disproportional news you rarely read in the newspaper somebody sitting at home watching tv has a heart attack doesn't make the news but if the person was in a gym or outdoor exercising it does make them so exercise is beneficial so don't
