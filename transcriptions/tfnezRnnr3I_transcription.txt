Transcript: hey guys if you're not able to watch my long form content of podcast here are some short form clips for you to enjoy how do you convince people how do you convince women that muscle is important I always say muscle is an age reversible organ yeah but obviously you meet them in your class you do dance but you encourage them to do resistance training so what's your take on on muscle for women I say the same thing that you say by the way that muscle is the only age reversible organ in the body and I I think more than anything else um we want to age gracefully right aging gracefully is is denied to most people like I look at my own parents today and I'm like they're they're 70 they've been fairly active all their life Etc but they don't have the strength so being active and you know not having the strength when you're at 70 doesn't match doesn't make sense but if you build enough strength by doing the right amount of resistance training weight training at least two to three times a week you are going to be able to age gracefully I mean you need the muscle mass you need your joints to function better you need a strong posterior chain to be able to walk without losing balance at 70 75 80 right but you know we keep saying this to our parents you need to wait train and stuff like that and I think nobody told that to them in their 20s 30s and 40s so they cannot develop up a new skill set in their 50s and 60s I agree but even at 50s and 60s to start doing some unilateral training and V not too late amazing impact yes in fact I would like to share with people there was this uh scientific research done which was these old age people they put them in a home yeah and in one part of the home they gave them board games and in another part of the uh old age home they gave them a gym resistant training chiefly leg extension 6 months later did the biopsy of the two groups the board game group and the knee extension group who did exercise and they found that muscle regressed by 6 years at the age of 72 so I think it's very keen to understand that um we have to encourage women to work out and you're a living proof example of it whil you publicly told us your age is 43 yes but her metabolic age is 31 so she's far a decade younger and I meet so many women in the clinic and that's why I was so inspired to have shamri as my first female guest on board because the paradigm shift is that women need to take care of their bodies yes they cannot have an excuse of husband children career yeah and our hormones you you you oh yeah we have only one hormone testosterone you have multiple hormones exactly if you want to like really keep that balance with the hormones and Etc there's nothing better than weight training nothing better than weight training and also training according to your cycle so on and so forth there's like there's we can go into depth of that later but every woman must pick up weights and it doesn't have to be heavy light or heavy the choice is ours we figure over a period of Time how important is it to have a personal trainer well it depends on a goal I think having a personal trainer is phenomenal it can really change the way you train because you would have seen a version of yourself which you wouldn't otherwise see in a group class because here the focus is just you right the trainer is trying to get the best out of you so I think everyone can experience getting a personal trainer to really identify what they're capable of and to have all the you know the right correction guidance postural changes and Etc but since personal training is expensive I would say even if you do you know group classes but if you wait train how often do you weit train every day you weit train every day is Sunday a rest day Sunday is yeah rest day I try to do some Mobility on Sunday at home with my daughter uh she's just I mean I do it she just jumps jumps in but um Saturday mostly would be a long run because I enjoy running and I feel like the human body is naturally designed to run so we can't kind of lose that you know ability and mobility and everything so weight training is something that's that's it should be non-negotiable for all women uh not just from a strength point of view because personally for me it's made me a very confident person nothing no education no you know different types of jobs has been able to give me the confidence that weight training has given me so yeah it just boosts your confidence five workouts that you would give any woman out there watching five workouts like she doesn't have time she has 20 minutes in the day yeah five exercises that she could do maybe five workouts is the wrong thing yeah exercise five exercises plank it's what your core and your spine really needs so it's mandatory and how much should a person hold a plank honestly even 45 seconds 60 seconds is more than enough I mean we don't want anyone to hold for 10 minutes and 5 minutes it's not a challenge right you do a 30 to 45 seconds flank and repeat like three to five and what should be the rest in between 15 seconds 15 second yeah more than enough 15 that's flat squats foundational movement especially if you can learn to deep squat if you practice about 10 minutes of deep Squat and you can accumulate there's there's one Instagram video of you talking about this even from a constipation point of view bow movement point of view and everything yes it's what we if you notice a toddler an infant to a toddler when they move squatting deep squatting is the first movement you know want to share something with you and share with all the women out there I recently went for a wellness Retreat and there were a phenomenal number of women over there and we were doing a yoga class where we had to go into a squat Po and I can tell you without a doubt about 80% of the women were not squatting properly they were on their toes or they were half squatted but they couldn't get into a deep squat so I think this is something that's crucial that women if you can't squat well and hold that position and then get up we need to really work on this with your trainer yes with you practicing it on a daily basis what's the third exercise okay squat plank lunges because lunges allows you to focus on balance and stability which is what you need as you age because as we age we lose balance and stability because it's a single leg movement it allows you to focus on balance and stability and excellent for your glute for your butt butt being the largest muscle and know how we need to keep it really strong uh also recent some studies show about how your posterior training especially your glutes and your hips can help in longevity because you're going to avoid more Falls and stuff like that so lunges right uh something that can take the heart rate up and can give you a you know a great quick cardio activity burpees it's my favorite Yona does my little one does burpees like with the finest technique and she learned it on her own but burpees is phenomenal for a quick burst of cardio you know you suddenly hit like zone three zone four come back so it's phenomenal the last exercise I don't know if this is an exercise but I feel every human being must walk more I was about to add this as my sixth one she came in so yes we've got walking tell us about walking and why oh my God I mean it's just what we're supposed to do I know we could have done this podcast Al walking but then there'll be too much distraction but walking is just something you're supposed to do and walking is best for fat loss I mean so many people struggling out there to Fat Loss you eat right you walk a lot you'll see that fat kind of melting away right it's one of your best Zone to training and we all need to do zone two training almost every day so it's the finest zone two training it's what the body is designed to do like we say sitting is a new smoking yeah awesome and I always tell people that when I work with the films Stars One prescription to all of them is please walk and they look at me very quizzically but to fat burn when you are walking your heart rate is in that targeted Zone where the substrate utilization meaning the source of fuel inside your body is not glycogen from the muscle which is the carb but actually fat the higher you go in your heart rate the more is glycogen as a fuel or a Battery Source the lower the intensity the more the fat you burn which is why we have something known as neat non exercise adaptive thermogenesis which is what your mother and what my mother and our grandparents did which is being fidgety around the house and cleaning and cooking and jaru and POA which is why a lot of you in the pandemic lost weight because the housekeeping didn't turn up so you were fidgeting you were constantly on the Move now speaking of constantly on the move you are one of the fittest moms in the country per se it's it's sham is the
