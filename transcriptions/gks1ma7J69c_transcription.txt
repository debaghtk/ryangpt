[15.52 - 21.24] it the most grueling race on the planet
[18.52 - 24.08] it is a lot for a person to deal
[21.24 - 25.32] with I like to call MDS is like the bare
[24.08 - 28.24] minimum
[25.32 - 30.28] race but coming down like this like big
[28.24 - 31.72] drop was scary so they Tire rope and you
[30.28 - 34.04] have to hold the rope and then you go
[31.72 - 36.68] down now imagine you're going down you
[34.04 - 39.64] have walking sticks you have a bag on
[36.68 - 41.44] you and then you have the mat of of on
[39.64 - 42.96] which you sleep which is to the bag so
[41.44 - 46.68] you're standing and there is like a
[42.96 - 49.00] steep it's a drop as I'm scared I'm
[46.68 - 51.60] trying to drag my feet in through the
[49.00 - 55.32] sand and the next thing I know I hit my
[51.60 - 58.20] leg on a big boulder inside MDS did have
[55.32 - 60.04] history of uh someone dying many years
[58.20 - 62.12] ago
[60.04 - 65.24] I think the toughest part of the
[62.12 - 69.44] marathon disabl preparation was the
[65.24 - 72.48] food mahash Goos one of the first Indian
[69.44 - 75.60] women to conquer the marathon day sabul

[82.36 - 86.44] Indians with a remarkable ability to
[84.88 - 88.72] balance Both
[86.44 - 91.72] Worlds why did you become a marathon
[88.72 - 91.72] runner
[94.56 - 98.16] so sha thank you for coming on my
[96.32 - 99.72] podcast it's a pleasure to have you
[98.16 - 103.12] today over
[99.72 - 104.72] here everyone knows you as a runner but
[103.12 - 106.96] let's start at the beginning were you
[104.72 - 108.00] always a runner did you did you have
[106.96 - 111.28] this thing that you were running
[108.00 - 113.48] marathons in school what's your story so
[111.28 - 115.60] Ryan thank you so much it's an absolute
[113.48 - 117.76] pleasure and Delight to be here and part
[115.60 - 120.08] of your podcast never thought I'm going
[117.76 - 123.56] to be here 5 years ago but something I
[120.08 - 126.48] did that got me here super happy uh to
[123.56 - 129.32] going back on how my life was I forget
[126.48 - 131.92] running I I never ever was even into
[129.32 - 135.36] sports I'm born to a traditional Bengali
[131.92 - 136.68] family where Focus was in education
[135.36 - 139.08] music
[136.68 - 140.80] painting uh the only complaint my
[139.08 - 143.04] parents ever got from school was I was
[140.80 - 147.24] never into any kind of sport so that's
[143.04 - 150.40] my background and uh I I think I
[147.24 - 153.36] continued being that person till I
[150.40 - 156.20] became so fat and I just didn't know
[153.36 - 158.28] what to do and then I took to Fitness as
[156.20 - 160.40] a as a rescue mission to get rid of it
[158.28 - 163.00] and you know those numbers I were 78 kgs
[160.40 - 166.92] in early 2000 pretty much in Bangalore
[163.00 - 169.08] studying in college and uh I remember
[166.92 - 171.16] that at one point I was not able to fit
[169.08 - 172.64] into any clothes that I had and every
[171.16 - 174.56] month I would have to go and buy new
[172.64 - 176.92] clothes and I to ask my dad this was the
[174.56 - 179.36] engineer you yes this was the engineer
[176.92 - 182.00] me and you're just out of college and I
[179.36 - 185.44] was in was in early 20s I was still in
[182.00 - 188.08] college and I was in early 20s and uh I
[185.44 - 189.56] had to just ask my dad for extra money
[188.08 - 191.40] every month because I had to go and buy
[189.56 - 194.68] newer clothes and of course with that I
[191.40 - 197.48] was also being very sick I got PCOS and
[194.68 - 199.72] pcod whatever and uh you know gastric
[197.48 - 202.00] issues in and out of the doctor all the
[199.72 - 205.00] time and at some point I think I just
[202.00 - 207.36] had this moment of breakdown meltdown as
[205.00 - 209.32] you would call it in today's terminology
[207.36 - 212.72] I said I cannot live like this my
[209.32 - 215.20] confidence was Rock Bottom uh I think if
[212.72 - 217.20] in today's situation you would evaluate
[215.20 - 219.68] it I was borderline a case of depression
[217.20 - 221.24] because I was so fat I only used to wear
[219.68 - 223.80] a certain kind of clothes because I
[221.24 - 225.56] didn't know what to wear and uh I think
[223.80 - 229.28] that was the turning point when I first
[225.56 - 232.00] started into a weight loss regime and
[229.28 - 234.72] the only Fitness activity I could get to
[232.00 - 238.28] doing was walking so I walked and in 3
[234.72 - 240.48] months of course I I did try to work on
[238.28 - 242.00] my nutrition and my food habit rather of
[240.48 - 243.96] course then it was called dieting and
[242.00 - 246.60] there was no concept of nutrition so I
[243.96 - 248.52] got into the traditional dieting model
[246.60 - 251.28] and I lost weight and then I joined a
[248.52 - 252.64] gym and then I was I continued that
[251.28 - 255.96] Journey because I didn't want to go back
[252.64 - 258.16] to being 78 kg so I was into gym and I
[255.96 - 260.16] decently managed to do my dieting
[258.16 - 263.12] borderline and you reached what about 6
[260.16 - 264.88] and I reached about 64 65 kgs and I
[263.12 - 269.88] sustained that till
[264.88 - 272.28] 2012 when I actually someone literally
[269.88 - 273.88] borderline he the dearest friend coass
[272.28 - 275.36] me to get into running saying that oh
[273.88 - 277.32] you're strong because you do gym and you
[275.36 - 279.08] should start running so that's my
[277.32 - 281.68] background so why did you become a
[279.08 - 284.16] marathon runner I mean like you said
[281.68 - 285.76] somebody coerced you to become a runner
[284.16 - 287.96] what what's your story on that he like
[285.76 - 290.36] the Nasha hit you on day one or it took
[287.96 - 293.20] a few months to get there it's uh it's
[290.36 - 294.88] funnier that I I used to work in vipro
[293.20 - 297.68] and then vipro used to have this run
[294.88 - 299.48] called uh the spirit of vipro run and
[297.68 - 301.32] also you used to work for Vio I used to
[299.48 - 303.40] work and they that time and they have a
[301.32 - 305.04] run they still have it it's one of the I
[303.40 - 307.16] think it's in the Guinness record or
[305.04 - 309.56] something saying that all locations
[307.16 - 312.36] within 24 hours some country is doing
[309.56 - 314.52] that run worldwide and so that's their
[312.36 - 316.52] USP and that was the run I registered
[314.52 - 319.16] for and the first ever time just signed
[316.52 - 320.44] up straight up for 21.1k then I called
[319.16 - 321.96] his friend I said okay now that you've
[320.44 - 324.12] got you signed up for
[321.96 - 326.60] 21.1 and you were only walking and
[324.12 - 329.08] jyming I had only done jyming and I by
[326.60 - 331.20] borderline hated running if I may say I
[329.08 - 332.64] thought it's extr ex boring and the only
[331.20 - 334.36] running I would do is like those 20
[332.64 - 336.32] minutes before my gym training on the
[334.36 - 338.72] treadmill which I really really would
[336.32 - 341.88] find an excuse into like you know not to
[338.72 - 345.20] do it absolutely had no I said okay you
[341.88 - 348.24] know and uh the funnier part is that his
[345.20 - 349.88] wife was my then boss so I said well you
[348.24 - 352.04] know what one time I'll just do this and
[349.88 - 354.08] get rid of it and then never again in my
[352.04 - 355.36] life and then I called him and I said
[354.08 - 357.80] okay now I've signed up tell me how to
[355.36 - 359.68] train and I broadly had like 3 months so
[357.80 - 361.16] he told okay 2 days you continue running
[359.68 - 363.76] on the gym and one day you go out and
[361.16 - 366.12] run in some wherever I was staying and
[363.76 - 368.28] that's how I did and then I I went to
[366.12 - 369.76] the race day I had no experience of what
[368.28 - 372.64] it means you don't know hydration
[369.76 - 373.88] nutrition nothing and I was I thought
[372.64 - 375.24] I'm going to be the last person
[373.88 - 376.68] everybody would have left by the time I
[375.24 - 379.28] came I came back and then somebody came
[376.68 - 381.16] running and said Madam Madam uh runner
[379.28 - 383.00] up I said what runner up I mean I would
[381.16 - 385.36] have come last everybody would have left
[383.00 - 389.08] so the my first ever half I did was in
[385.36 - 391.44] 215 which is by the number game isn't a
[389.08 - 393.72] decent is is a pretty good number even
[391.44 - 396.12] today so that was like my first trigger
[393.72 - 398.36] saying oh you know what this isn't bad I
[396.12 - 400.20] can try you got the N I got the Ki
[398.36 - 402.04] saying and so I I was the second runner
[400.20 - 404.20] up so I was like okay maybe next year I
[402.04 - 406.28] can be I can either come first or be the
[404.20 - 408.40] second runner up and then so I continued
[406.28 - 409.80] doing that only with that goal that okay
[408.40 - 411.68] next year I'm going to like so I
[409.80 - 413.72] suddenly found myself putting up into a
[411.68 - 416.88] goal to do it I think that just kicked
[413.72 - 419.20] in saying I in the very first race I I
[416.88 - 421.04] enjoyed the flavor of what it does you
[419.20 - 423.12] get a medal it's like you know somebody
[421.04 - 425.56] told very interestingly that this is One
[423.12 - 427.68] race where you don't have to win to get
[425.56 - 429.08] a medal it's like instant gratification
[427.68 - 431.24] never thought of it like that I have a
[429.08 - 433.24] wall full of medals you've seen it so I
[431.24 - 436.08] thought that was that was rather amazing
[433.24 - 439.32] to start with and and then the rest is
[436.08 - 441.80] history so you know Marathon half
[439.32 - 446.64] marathon runers up position a full
[441.80 - 449.08] marathon is what distance 42 42.2 point2
[446.64 - 452.56] that's a that's a long distance okay but
[449.08 - 454.12] even driving a car that distance like
[452.56 - 456.64] like we live in the city of Bangalore
[454.12 - 459.00] okay and you're visiting me today and
[456.64 - 461.32] average speed in bangal is 15 km/ hour
[459.00 - 463.80] so if I sit in a car I'm actually taking
[461.32 - 466.28] almost 3 hours to reach there and you
[463.80 - 470.40] would actually run faster than that in
[466.28 - 475.24] in most Marathon bases so people are Now
[470.40 - 477.40] setting themselves up to do 5K 10K uh 22
[475.24 - 480.92] 21 which is the half and the full
[477.40 - 482.80] Marathon what has been your most let me
[480.92 - 485.16] ask me this how many marathons have you
[482.80 - 487.92] run so far approximately would you have
[485.16 - 490.60] cost 100 marathons by now yeah if I add
[487.92 - 493.04] all distances across yes but if I say
[490.60 - 495.88] only the full distance which the 42.2 I
[493.04 - 498.36] I just did my 18th in uh Mumbai
[495.88 - 500.20] wonderful and in all of these all of
[498.36 - 502.84] them whether whatever irres to the
[500.20 - 506.36] distance which has been your most
[502.84 - 510.92] memorable Marathon or or most memorable
[506.36 - 513.20] run I think Jerusalem Marathon stay is
[510.92 - 516.96] my most
[513.20 - 518.80] memorable Marathon ever why so for for
[516.96 - 521.12] many reasons is that the distance is
[518.80 - 523.48] same for most marathons right of course
[521.12 - 526.48] of course so is that it's my first
[523.48 - 528.76] International Marathon okay and uh how
[526.48 - 530.96] did you land in Jerusalem of all places
[528.76 - 532.84] very funny most people do London or
[530.96 - 535.84] Boston or Chicago I mean you have to
[532.84 - 537.96] qualify to get it so what was the logic
[535.84 - 540.92] I think I think I have I have a really
[537.96 - 542.00] bad set of friends so this another I
[540.92 - 543.76] hope they're not listening to this
[542.00 - 546.52] podcast I hope they're listening to this
[543.76 - 548.08] because so this friend of mine said oh
[546.52 - 551.64] we should do Jerusalem because Jerusalem
[548.08 - 553.92] is known as the highest marathon in the
[551.64 - 556.20] in the in the Marathon distance
[553.92 - 558.00] worldwide because it's extreme high
[556.20 - 560.28] elevations because of the terrain that
[558.00 - 562.04] it is and it and makes you run through
[560.28 - 563.68] the city so this friend said oh we
[562.04 - 565.24] should do my Jerusalem I'm going to do
[563.68 - 567.52] Jerusalem marathon and this and that I
[565.24 - 569.60] said well okay you know let me also sign
[567.52 - 570.92] up and I'm very diligent when I say
[569.60 - 572.92] something then I say something it's not
[570.92 - 574.40] like I'm going to I don't I just don't
[572.92 - 575.80] say it for the heck of it so I said and
[574.40 - 577.80] next thing I know I've registered and
[575.80 - 579.20] then I've applied for visa and I have
[577.80 - 580.96] visa and everything and then I called
[579.20 - 583.08] and I said have you signed up he's like
[580.96 - 585.08] oh no I'm still thinking I'm like excuse
[583.08 - 586.60] me so the friend is convinced every want
[585.08 - 587.68] to go to Jerusalem has not signed up
[586.60 - 589.24] yeah he's not signed up but you have
[587.68 - 591.00] already got your tickets I got my
[589.24 - 593.44] tickets everything is said I am going I
[591.00 - 596.88] said okay then I'm going so you know
[593.44 - 599.52] friend sign up no okay so so the find
[596.88 - 601.04] that friend and shoot him yeah I mean I
[599.52 - 602.76] really I was like I will never forgive
[601.04 - 607.68] you for like so I went to Jerusalem all
[602.76 - 611.28] by myself you know and uh and I did this
[607.68 - 612.72] run now why it is why it is uh my
[611.28 - 614.48] favorite is that there's the first time
[612.72 - 617.28] in an Airbnb I actually stayed with the
[614.48 - 619.80] Jewish family and I still have such fond
[617.28 - 622.24] memories of that place where I stayed
[619.80 - 624.60] second interesting thing Jerusalem shuts
[622.24 - 627.12] down the city on the day of the race and
[624.60 - 629.40] then shuts down literally like because
[627.12 - 631.16] you cannot get taxi nothing and I was
[629.40 - 633.20] staying obviously in an Airbnb which is
[631.16 - 635.56] in a residential area and I had to go to
[633.20 - 637.48] this park where the Run starts so and I
[635.56 - 638.80] had booked pre-booked a taxi so the taxi
[637.48 - 640.52] said yeah yeah we're going to come and
[638.80 - 642.76] all of that called him in early morning
[640.52 - 644.28] getting ready ready to leave waiting to
[642.76 - 645.84] come yeah yeah coming coming coming I'm
[644.28 - 647.44] going and waiting down and I never carry
[645.84 - 648.92] my phone and I'm all alone so where am I
[647.44 - 651.64] going to leave my bag and phone and all
[648.92 - 653.44] that so no phone I go then after he's
[651.64 - 654.88] not come he's not come he's not com I'm
[653.44 - 656.64] like my heart rate is really racing
[654.88 - 658.40] already and then at some point he says
[656.64 - 660.84] no the city is closed I can't come and I
[658.40 - 663.08] oh shcks it's like 7 km from where I'm
[660.84 - 665.96] staying is the start line do a pre-warm
[663.08 - 667.84] up run of 7 kilome yes so so then I said
[665.96 - 669.52] okay whatever I saw the map and I said
[667.84 - 671.28] okay this is broadly in which direction
[669.52 - 672.96] I have to go rest I'm going to ask
[671.28 - 674.88] whoever is on the way to the start point
[672.96 - 677.56] I will reach 7 km. I have enough time I
[674.88 - 679.56] will run to the start Line run to the
[677.56 - 681.52] start line that's the start of my first
[679.56 - 683.80] International Marathon so I went I
[681.52 - 685.40] started running then I saw some cops I I
[683.80 - 686.96] pleaded their cops saying can you please
[685.40 - 688.92] drop me to the start line the cops
[686.96 - 690.80] called their boss and said can we drop
[688.92 - 693.40] this l she has a bab and she's going for
[690.80 - 695.36] the race so they declined so there was
[693.40 - 698.08] this taxi guy who had who was canning
[695.36 - 700.60] some I don't know some six seven people
[698.08 - 701.76] he charged he said I will take 2x money
[700.60 - 704.00] but I will take you to the start
[701.76 - 706.80] location however up to me I said dude
[704.00 - 708.88] you take $100 I don't care save me 7K
[706.80 - 711.16] running before the run so it was so
[708.88 - 713.16] sweet that actually that guy took me to
[711.16 - 715.32] the start line I reached on time and I
[713.16 - 717.48] did the run the Run was beautiful it
[715.32 - 720.12] takes you through the whole city cobone
[717.48 - 721.64] to like cobblestone elev like was the
[720.12 - 723.40] first time I saw like you don't see this
[721.64 - 725.00] this the first International right so
[723.40 - 727.28] you don't see like you're here and then
[725.00 - 729.08] 500 M you see like everybody's going up
[727.28 - 730.76] straight like that it's that high
[729.08 - 733.68] elevation and then you're going steep
[730.76 - 735.76] down it was insane I had I think I aimed
[733.68 - 737.96] to do like a 450 you know something I
[735.76 - 740.04] was still not as fast as I am now but
[737.96 - 742.20] then I ended up doing a 445 because I
[740.04 - 743.92] was like that slow and the terrain and
[742.20 - 745.36] people were zipping past obviously the
[743.92 - 747.92] locals who live and train in there for
[745.36 - 750.40] them it was like a cakewalk but I and
[747.92 - 752.40] the prettiest City I could run and you
[750.40 - 755.84] can see the entire city running through
[752.40 - 758.76] the route so I Jerusalem by far stays my
[755.84 - 760.20] favorite ever whever I've run I think I
[758.76 - 763.52] haven't had another one which will take
[760.20 - 766.76] away that experience so many people may
[763.52 - 769.20] know this uh out there that I am her
[766.76 - 773.68] nutritionist and my favorite run with
[769.20 - 775.28] her is the marathon the sapla the MDS so
[773.68 - 777.68] you know um I thought you would have
[775.28 - 779.76] said that is your favorite run but I I
[777.68 - 783.36] also remember it was your most
[779.76 - 786.96] grueling Testament to the metal grit
[783.36 - 791.16] that any individual on the planet has so
[786.96 - 794.80] tell me and tell my fans about the MDS
[791.16 - 796.24] first of all why is it the most grueling
[794.80 - 798.60] race on the planet and when I say
[796.24 - 802.04] grueling it can kill
[798.60 - 805.92] you yeah MDS did have history of uh
[802.04 - 809.20] someone dying many years ago but uh and
[805.92 - 813.72] so the distance is so so I think what
[809.20 - 816.44] makes MDS tough is uh I split it into
[813.72 - 818.52] three parts and the first part is of
[816.44 - 821.08] course the fact that the terrain it's in
[818.52 - 824.16] the Sahara Desert uh and so you're
[821.08 - 827.16] running a distance in the Sahara Desert
[824.16 - 831.16] yeah and when we say desert in India if
[827.16 - 835.28] you go to say jessl and see India I've
[831.16 - 838.56] done in pokran and that terrain is tough
[835.28 - 840.56] but I had not seen what a desert really
[838.56 - 843.52] is just to give you a context and I'll
[840.56 - 844.92] give you a very uh something that people
[843.52 - 847.48] probably would have done is when you go
[844.92 - 849.32] to Dubai and you do the Dune bashing you
[847.48 - 853.16] know how those Dune bashings are right
[849.32 - 856.08] so imagine 2x of that Dune sizes is what
[853.16 - 858.52] MDS has that's only the dunes then there
[856.08 - 861.32] are these Rocky terrains which has those
[858.52 - 863.52] Pokey rocks because of the sand abration
[861.32 - 865.52] the the rocks are very very sharp so
[863.52 - 867.68] they have this little narrow patch
[865.52 - 869.40] through which you have to run some parts
[867.68 - 872.52] they actually you have to climb holding
[869.40 - 875.88] a rope uh and then of course those Dunes
[872.52 - 878.68] are miles and miles and miles long and
[875.88 - 881.84] that heat so so now everyone's thinking
[878.68 - 884.00] this is a one day race yeah so so that
[881.84 - 886.28] is number one is the terrain the second
[884.00 - 889.12] is the distance and the way the distance
[886.28 - 892.84] is planned now it is a
[889.12 - 895.52] 250 I my it so the distance is distance
[892.84 - 899.12] varies between in the range of 250
[895.52 - 901.08] because it 250 km 250 km it cannot be
[899.12 - 903.64] the same distance because since they are
[901.08 - 905.76] you work you're in the desert like you
[903.64 - 909.88] know you you that it kind of varies by 2
[905.76 - 912.76] 3 4 km sit in a car and drive 250 km I
[909.88 - 916.04] crib I just cannot imagine how somebody
[912.76 - 919.16] will decide to run 250 kmet that too in
[916.04 - 921.84] the Sahara Desert yeah so and and it is
[919.16 - 923.48] done through six stages now it's not
[921.84 - 925.08] like you you know today I don't feel
[923.48 - 927.44] like running so I will do 20 and
[925.08 - 931.48] tomorrow I will do 100 today if I'm
[927.44 - 933.16] scheduled to do 42 or 38 or 31 then I
[931.48 - 935.00] have to do that and I have to finish
[933.16 - 937.60] within the cut off time for me to
[935.00 - 940.88] qualify to do the next day so every day
[937.60 - 943.40] is a race against yourself yes and to
[940.88 - 945.76] qualify every day is a race for you to
[943.40 - 948.56] qualify for the next day so it can be
[945.76 - 952.04] that with all this preparation you know
[948.56 - 953.84] in my epis season some there were people
[952.04 - 957.64] who actually didn't make it to the last
[953.84 - 959.44] day like they were disqualified the day
[957.64 - 962.16] they were getting the medal can you
[959.44 - 966.32] imagine how hurtful that would be like
[962.16 - 968.28] they've gone through the entire 256 km
[966.32 - 971.48] torture yes but they still didn't make
[968.28 - 973.76] it on the Finish Line I don't think I
[971.48 - 977.40] can deal with that pain like you know so
[973.76 - 979.44] that is why MDS has this it is it is
[977.40 - 982.08] unique and surprising in terms of giving
[979.44 - 983.56] you pain at all different levels okay
[982.08 - 985.24] now the third part is it is you know it
[983.56 - 987.04] is self-supported which means that you
[985.24 - 990.56] carry everything that you need for the
[987.04 - 992.68] race during the race your hydration
[990.56 - 995.96] nutrition your lunch your dinner your
[992.68 - 999.40] sleeping accessories your uh race gear
[995.96 - 1002.16] everything on you and you carry that bag
[999.40 - 1004.88] and you run on your by yourself so
[1002.16 - 1008.12] you're in the desert you got to do it
[1004.88 - 1013.32] over five or 6 days six 6 days you've
[1008.12 - 1015.52] got 250 kilm D in sand and to top it off
[1013.32 - 1018.92] you're carrying everything that you own
[1015.52 - 1020.04] through this desert over 6 days and now
[1018.92 - 1023.56] they tell you to carry your food and
[1020.04 - 1026.40] water also with you yes they only give
[1023.56 - 1028.48] you water which is also at the
[1026.40 - 1030.96] temperature whatever it can sustain so
[1028.48 - 1032.92] there's no concept of cold water as
[1030.96 - 1036.40] marathoners we are very we luxurious
[1032.92 - 1039.00] Runners we get chilled water ice and uh
[1036.40 - 1042.44] cold sponge and food and all of that you
[1039.00 - 1045.44] get nothing all you get is water which
[1042.44 - 1047.64] is which which we ideally got lukewarm
[1045.44 - 1050.24] water so I drank lukewarm water through
[1047.64 - 1051.92] the race and when I got really really
[1050.24 - 1053.88] bugged and I wanted to have something
[1051.92 - 1056.08] cold I would take that water when I was
[1053.88 - 1059.40] back in the tent and then I would wrap
[1056.08 - 1061.36] up my uh buff with water and then cover
[1059.40 - 1063.92] it and let it be after maybe one two
[1061.36 - 1066.04] year hours that water will cool down to
[1063.92 - 1070.36] become like in drinkable temperature or
[1066.04 - 1072.12] something like that now uh the food is
[1070.36 - 1074.00] critical because you have there's a
[1072.12 - 1075.64] mandate as well by the way there are no
[1074.00 - 1077.36] kitchens in the Sahara Desert if
[1075.64 - 1079.04] anyone's thinking there is you have to
[1077.36 - 1080.40] light your own fire you have to light
[1079.04 - 1082.32] you have to carry your own fire I
[1080.40 - 1085.28] remember carry your own stuff and you
[1082.32 - 1087.36] have to light your own fire now uh just
[1085.28 - 1089.36] to give people perspective that that
[1087.36 - 1091.44] tent that I'm talking about is actually
[1089.36 - 1094.00] like a tarpine which is which is in an
[1091.44 - 1095.60] inverted V shape tucked with logs at the
[1094.00 - 1098.84] back and it's open on both sides there's
[1095.60 - 1101.12] no cover and you you carry that no that
[1098.84 - 1103.00] that tent is what they carry and they
[1101.12 - 1105.60] set it up for us so the tents are laid
[1103.00 - 1107.64] out by numbers like our rooms we are
[1105.60 - 1109.16] allocated those tents and all of we have
[1107.64 - 1111.28] to stay in those tents each tend to
[1109.16 - 1113.32] shared by eight people we have like a
[1111.28 - 1115.32] thick carpet at the bottom which is like
[1113.32 - 1117.12] a du nothing better than that and a
[1115.32 - 1118.80] similar thing on the top the sand come
[1117.12 - 1121.00] to the tent so that's what I'm saying
[1118.80 - 1123.28] and in both sides it's open and every
[1121.00 - 1125.32] evening we had Sandstorm and every
[1123.28 - 1127.52] evening everything we had was in sand so
[1125.32 - 1129.92] you had sand in every cice of your body
[1127.52 - 1132.80] yes and we had sand like it by you can't
[1129.92 - 1135.84] have a bath okay there is yeah so yeah
[1132.80 - 1138.28] so 12 lit water they give you every day
[1135.84 - 1140.52] day so you get only 12 L of water and
[1138.28 - 1143.24] that water is for you to brush poop do
[1140.52 - 1146.04] whatever 12 lit is all you get for your
[1143.24 - 1148.40] cooking for your race for your hydration
[1146.04 - 1152.00] for your hydration for your whatever you
[1148.40 - 1155.00] need to do you can get additional water
[1152.00 - 1157.08] at an expense of time so like if you
[1155.00 - 1158.80] take say it's like a video game yeah
[1157.08 - 1160.76] yeah so if it's like you take extra
[1158.80 - 1163.52] bottle of water saying okay I want like
[1160.76 - 1165.24] they give you two 1.5 L bottles and then
[1163.52 - 1167.64] the big five can when you come back to
[1165.24 - 1169.56] the camp so if you take extra water take
[1167.64 - 1171.68] first time you ask 30 30 minute add it
[1169.56 - 1173.60] to your time now people are struggling
[1171.68 - 1176.28] here to finish like you know 10 hours
[1173.60 - 1178.56] you make it to like 9:55 imagine what
[1176.28 - 1180.28] it'll do to add 30 minute to you first
[1178.56 - 1182.24] time 30 minute second time 1 hour I
[1180.28 - 1185.32] think if you ask third time then you're
[1182.24 - 1187.96] disqualified so it's not like you can uh
[1185.32 - 1190.24] borrow the other strict rule is that you
[1187.96 - 1192.84] cannot borrow from anybody if you are
[1190.24 - 1196.12] caught borrowing then you will be pulled
[1192.84 - 1198.40] out of the race the the runner who had
[1196.12 - 1201.44] been having the first position through
[1198.40 - 1203.64] last 10 years was actually given penalty
[1201.44 - 1206.72] because he was caught taking something
[1203.64 - 1210.12] from somebody so it's only water it's
[1206.72 - 1211.76] food also it's everything okay like if
[1210.12 - 1214.08] you're sitting in the camp and you're
[1211.76 - 1215.80] like sharing and all of that is okay but
[1214.08 - 1218.12] if you're taking anything borrowing like
[1215.80 - 1221.44] you know extra water or extra food so
[1218.12 - 1224.32] the race is you have to carry what you
[1221.44 - 1227.08] consume and if you don't carry what what
[1224.32 - 1231.12] you are meant to consume deal with it
[1227.08 - 1233.44] yes if you you cannot even trash it's
[1231.12 - 1235.28] it's an eco-friendly race you cannot
[1233.44 - 1236.48] even trash outside of where you're
[1235.28 - 1239.88] sitting so like the bottles they give
[1236.48 - 1242.08] you carry a bib number oh so so you have
[1239.88 - 1245.60] to be really climate conscious about
[1242.08 - 1247.28] what you're doing yes so you suppose I
[1245.60 - 1248.56] know about this so when you go to the
[1247.28 - 1249.92] when you go to the checkpoint for
[1248.56 - 1252.56] example they're going to give you your
[1249.92 - 1254.60] bottle so so our dehydrated food sachets
[1252.56 - 1258.84] and MTR sashes and all all had to be
[1254.60 - 1261.32] disposed Very Yes wherever so that you
[1258.84 - 1263.56] eting say in the camp right so you they
[1261.32 - 1265.36] have uh every tent has like a bin that
[1263.56 - 1267.00] you put in stuff the important part is
[1265.36 - 1268.16] water because water they give you
[1267.00 - 1269.20] through the race points like because
[1268.16 - 1271.00] you're filling your water at the
[1269.20 - 1273.12] checkpoint to the checkpoint they give
[1271.00 - 1274.88] you either two bottles or 1.5 so which
[1273.12 - 1277.16] you can refill like for example I was
[1274.88 - 1280.48] carrying the bag and I had 1.5 L bottles
[1277.16 - 1282.12] on me total 750 750 one had the coction
[1280.48 - 1284.76] that you gave me which I will talk about
[1282.12 - 1286.64] and the other one was plain water now
[1284.76 - 1288.84] that remaining water bottle if you
[1286.64 - 1290.92] choose to carry with yourself then you
[1288.84 - 1293.52] have to carry back to the next
[1290.92 - 1294.92] checkpoint or you leave it at the
[1293.52 - 1297.00] checkpoint that you are because you
[1294.92 - 1298.24] cannot trash it on the way if anybody
[1297.00 - 1300.56] finds out and they're really really
[1298.24 - 1302.52] strict and you'll have people U you know
[1300.56 - 1304.36] guarding you all through if they find
[1302.52 - 1306.16] out the bottle it has your bib number
[1304.36 - 1307.96] you'll be given penalty to the extent
[1306.16 - 1309.68] that you may be pulled out of the race
[1307.96 - 1311.32] wow so so you cannot do that the other
[1309.68 - 1313.76] interesting part somebody and everybody
[1311.32 - 1315.60] ask me saying what do you do for toilet
[1313.76 - 1317.80] and I I have the scene that MDS makes
[1315.60 - 1319.76] you clean your own it literally
[1317.80 - 1322.40] does they your poop bags like you have
[1319.76 - 1324.12] for dogs yeah so they you take your poop
[1322.40 - 1326.08] bags you go to oh it's not like in India
[1324.12 - 1328.12] you can just do it and leave yeah it's
[1326.08 - 1329.64] not like you can go do it and this is
[1328.12 - 1331.76] the Sara desert where there's nobody
[1329.64 - 1333.44] there yes so you could bury your
[1331.76 - 1335.80] basically yeah but but they don't allow
[1333.44 - 1338.00] you to bury your you cannot do that
[1335.80 - 1339.64] you have you have those enclosures kind
[1338.00 - 1342.00] of made and which H which has like a
[1339.64 - 1343.96] western uh you know style uh
[1342.00 - 1346.68] infrastructure you put the poop bag
[1343.96 - 1348.08] there you use it lift it pick it up tie
[1346.68 - 1351.04] it up and there's a bin there which you
[1348.08 - 1353.44] very go through now you can and if you
[1351.04 - 1355.04] have to say on the go road while you're
[1353.44 - 1357.24] running if you have to use outside the
[1355.04 - 1358.72] checkpoint that's probably exceptions
[1357.24 - 1360.32] where but how many of you doing but if
[1358.72 - 1362.04] you're at the camp you cannot just go
[1360.32 - 1364.08] and litter anywhere so there's no
[1362.04 - 1366.56] concept of littering they do have an
[1364.08 - 1369.40] extremely good care of medical facility
[1366.56 - 1372.56] now of all of these the third point of
[1369.40 - 1373.84] why MDS is difficult is because through
[1372.56 - 1378.20] that
[1373.84 - 1381.64] race uh that that whole experience of
[1378.20 - 1384.08] phys physical pain added to it the
[1381.64 - 1387.20] mental preparation I think it needs a
[1384.08 - 1389.00] next level of mental great determination
[1387.20 - 1392.56] to be doing that kind of race because
[1389.00 - 1394.56] you obviously not eating the food that
[1392.56 - 1396.56] you like you're not eating you know if
[1394.56 - 1398.12] you're feeling cold and hot and sunny
[1396.56 - 1400.28] you typically want to have hot cold
[1398.12 - 1402.32] water or cold drink or open the fridge
[1400.28 - 1404.24] and have something you don't even get
[1402.32 - 1407.88] the kind of food that you used to eating
[1404.24 - 1410.64] like I ate uh you know what I not even
[1407.88 - 1412.56] Frozen f like that halam Dal chavel for
[1410.64 - 1414.68] forever now even if I look in the flight
[1412.56 - 1418.28] and I'm like oh my God how did I eat
[1414.68 - 1421.08] this for 7 days so I think sum of
[1418.28 - 1423.60] putting all of this together it is a lot
[1421.08 - 1426.68] for a person to deal with it just kind
[1423.60 - 1428.64] of takes you to the bare minimum I like
[1426.68 - 1432.36] to call MDS is like the bare minimum
[1428.64 - 1434.04] race you only have as much as you need
[1432.36 - 1436.56] like my mom asked me a very interesting
[1434.04 - 1439.48] question before I was leaving she said
[1436.56 - 1441.96] so what if you like you need something
[1439.48 - 1444.88] and you don't have it I said that's the
[1441.96 - 1447.12] whole point that you know you may need
[1444.88 - 1449.00] something but you don't have it so how
[1447.12 - 1451.96] do you survive in such situations I
[1449.00 - 1454.04] think it's a race of survival as against
[1451.96 - 1456.80] the way we kind of deal with all our
[1454.04 - 1459.60] other runs so for me it was very
[1456.80 - 1462.00] exciting when you came up to me and said
[1459.60 - 1466.32] Ryan I'm going to do the MDS and I was
[1462.00 - 1469.24] like oh oh because it's it's I feel it's
[1466.32 - 1471.48] every nutritionist worst nightmare
[1469.24 - 1474.80] because planning a planning a diet plan
[1471.48 - 1476.64] for marathon runners you know different
[1474.80 - 1478.60] races across the world Ultra marathons
[1476.64 - 1481.04] and all it's pretty easy because you go
[1478.60 - 1483.76] to a place you stop you can get whatever
[1481.04 - 1485.80] you want the cold water the Biryani you
[1483.76 - 1488.04] know you can eat what you want the gels
[1485.80 - 1490.64] and all and in this race everything is
[1488.04 - 1495.16] boiling down to that 13 kgs that you
[1490.64 - 1497.28] could carry yeah I think my bag was 11.5
[1495.16 - 1498.84] but minimum minimum eight and I think
[1497.28 - 1500.76] maximum you could do was four
[1498.84 - 1502.12] 14 yeah but you know when we were
[1500.76 - 1504.36] planning the whole thing I still
[1502.12 - 1506.56] remember we were snipping off sashes so
[1504.36 - 1508.00] they could become lighter and then I'm
[1506.56 - 1509.84] not going to carry this I'm not going to
[1508.00 - 1512.36] carry this I'll just eat this basic so
[1509.84 - 1515.00] then we decided to plan psychological
[1512.36 - 1516.84] warfare also if you remember we tested
[1515.00 - 1520.76] out those Foods where you got bored and
[1516.84 - 1522.56] ate it for a few days too but um give us
[1520.76 - 1523.44] some insights into what we packed into
[1522.56 - 1527.32] your
[1523.44 - 1531.28] bag so I think the toughest part of the
[1527.32 - 1533.28] marathon Thea's preparation was the food
[1531.28 - 1535.48] I think I I
[1533.28 - 1536.64] remember uh this was pretty much the
[1535.48 - 1540.64] same time
[1536.64 - 1543.60] last uh 2023 when I think I had this
[1540.64 - 1545.96] room filled with all kinds of packed
[1543.60 - 1551.68] food wherever I could find like from
[1545.96 - 1555.24] fight to uh you know any food store uh I
[1551.68 - 1557.16] remember uh Sanjay going to some from
[1555.24 - 1558.72] Food Market he got everything like
[1557.16 - 1561.84] everybody got everything everything that
[1558.72 - 1564.68] they could think of and it was my job to
[1561.84 - 1567.44] kind of eat and reject or
[1564.68 - 1568.64] accept yeah yeah it was it was really
[1567.44 - 1570.52] really horrible I remember this one
[1568.64 - 1572.04] question you asked me is like like Ryan
[1570.52 - 1574.92] what about the nutritional content of it
[1572.04 - 1578.44] and I said scha we have already done one
[1574.92 - 1581.04] MDS the nutritional content for 5 days
[1578.44 - 1582.84] if you can just eat an idly or Crispies
[1581.04 - 1585.80] you will still survive because your body
[1582.84 - 1587.72] will go where you will break down is
[1585.80 - 1589.96] psychologically and therefore the food
[1587.72 - 1593.00] could be that one thing that may be
[1589.96 - 1594.92] giving you that Ray of Hope so so good
[1593.00 - 1596.88] you bring that up is because I think
[1594.92 - 1598.72] when you remember I think we we went
[1596.88 - 1600.72] through that Excel of ours like three
[1598.72 - 1603.04] four five times the first time we did
[1600.72 - 1604.52] and we put it up uh first of all tasting
[1603.04 - 1606.72] that food was the most horrendous
[1604.52 - 1608.48] experience because as you know I don't
[1606.72 - 1610.60] like eating packed food and all of that
[1608.48 - 1612.68] I I'm a big fan of you know cook fresh
[1610.60 - 1615.64] and eat I don't even like fridge food so
[1612.68 - 1618.44] for me to put like hot water into some
[1615.64 - 1620.36] halam daba and Dal chaan and I was like
[1618.44 - 1622.40] God what is it doing to my body kind of
[1620.36 - 1624.68] a feeling all thanks to you you make me
[1622.40 - 1628.08] feel like that but I think so that was
[1624.68 - 1630.32] the toughest part and then then when we
[1628.08 - 1631.88] uh built that list I think and when we
[1630.32 - 1634.92] started packing we realized that the
[1631.88 - 1637.04] weight was like insane there's no way we
[1634.92 - 1638.80] could carry that and then the amount of
[1637.04 - 1640.88] gel and bar and all of that and I think
[1638.80 - 1643.60] that's when we started R rationing
[1640.88 - 1646.32] saying okay you know one that was the
[1643.60 - 1648.92] equation that you and I had which is I
[1646.32 - 1651.40] went to the max of your weight yeah
[1648.92 - 1653.88] because the logic was okay she can carry
[1651.40 - 1655.52] this much she can eat this much normally
[1653.88 - 1658.04] let's give it to her but I think where
[1655.52 - 1661.56] you came back to me was I'm going in as
[1658.04 - 1664.16] a soldier uh and I think I can if you're
[1661.56 - 1666.20] giving me 100% you I I actually remember
[1664.16 - 1669.52] you seeing that you could even survive
[1666.20 - 1671.88] at 40% correct I I think I when I was
[1669.52 - 1673.84] training with that bag I remember I was
[1671.88 - 1676.40] training like I trained with my bag for
[1673.84 - 1678.48] like about 7 8 kgs and I said okay this
[1676.40 - 1682.32] is this is manageable you know this is
[1678.48 - 1685.20] manageable in Goro in a in a flat Road
[1682.32 - 1686.36] in in and and I'm doing it like one time
[1685.20 - 1688.72] I think you started panicking when the
[1686.36 - 1690.28] bag went beyond 10 KS yes I I really
[1688.72 - 1693.04] really freaked out and I think that's
[1690.28 - 1694.92] when I said okay you know like remove
[1693.04 - 1696.76] remove remove remove what is it that is
[1694.92 - 1699.24] bare minimum we also went to the extent
[1696.76 - 1701.88] of even taking the readymade food where
[1699.24 - 1704.00] the foil packing was 250 g and we found
[1701.88 - 1707.48] out a foil packing that was half that
[1704.00 - 1708.96] weight I removed the packings except
[1707.48 - 1712.08] anything that was was like this Nitro
[1708.96 - 1714.08] packing except that I think I got those
[1712.08 - 1716.68] small packs of everything and anything I
[1714.08 - 1718.68] could bring out even the bars I took the
[1716.68 - 1721.08] lightest weight of the bars I got most
[1718.68 - 1723.28] of the stuff from wherever I could to to
[1721.08 - 1726.24] to do that but what was interesting is
[1723.28 - 1728.64] that I did keep things that as you say
[1726.24 - 1730.16] that gave a psychological boost you know
[1728.64 - 1732.12] like if you remember the pickle you
[1730.16 - 1735.08] suggested I carry yeah imagine I
[1732.12 - 1739.76] remember pickle in MDS because my
[1735.08 - 1739.76] thought process desert
[1740.60 - 1746.56] but an Indian wants a pickle no and
[1743.40 - 1749.64] eating that gel and those bars after a
[1746.56 - 1751.84] while my only like one two day three was
[1749.64 - 1753.84] okay the day after I finished the long
[1751.84 - 1756.20] run day and I do want to talk about how
[1753.84 - 1758.72] that rer as that one was you know your
[1756.20 - 1760.68] taste parts are completely dead like the
[1758.72 - 1762.60] the the look of the gel and you want to
[1760.68 - 1764.32] puke so all you want to do is what do
[1762.60 - 1766.52] you do and pickle was such a Saving
[1764.32 - 1768.24] Grace I know that when I do next time
[1766.52 - 1769.88] I'm going to cut short one more jelly
[1768.24 - 1773.32] carry an extra pickle because that was
[1769.88 - 1775.24] the Survivor so I think like you know uh
[1773.32 - 1776.84] the pickle those little little things I
[1775.24 - 1778.60] remember I carried a packet of little
[1776.84 - 1780.80] hearts As a treat to me because you
[1778.60 - 1782.96] really like little hearts the the the
[1780.80 - 1786.40] potato chips that I carried you know I
[1782.96 - 1788.72] think some of those things to to ensure
[1786.40 - 1791.80] that I am getting a little bit of that
[1788.72 - 1794.60] food pleasure if you may say was was
[1791.80 - 1796.24] absolutely helpful the hajola that I
[1794.60 - 1797.76] carry do you remember when I came when
[1796.24 - 1801.24] you came back and I met you for the
[1797.76 - 1803.24] first time I I actually gifted her
[1801.24 - 1804.44] packets of chips because I realized you
[1803.24 - 1806.72] know as a nutritionist there's
[1804.44 - 1808.08] physiology and there's psychology and
[1806.72 - 1811.64] people might think hey this nutritionist
[1808.08 - 1813.68] is giving L chips to her client and it's
[1811.64 - 1816.44] it's about the psychology it was not
[1813.68 - 1818.56] about the physiology of nutrition it it
[1816.44 - 1820.36] was it was the most thrilling experience
[1818.56 - 1822.32] that Ryan walks into my house with this
[1820.36 - 1824.16] whole bag and it opens and gives say you
[1822.32 - 1826.40] know chips and I said and this I have to
[1824.16 - 1829.32] take a picture because I earned this
[1826.40 - 1831.40] chips packet by running it MDS I think
[1829.32 - 1834.40] so it was but those those are the
[1831.40 - 1837.24] Hilarious Moments you know that you had
[1834.40 - 1838.80] but um you know there were I remember
[1837.24 - 1841.04] when you came back you said there were
[1838.80 - 1843.84] moments that you wanted to just quit up
[1841.04 - 1846.64] and give and you you hit rock bottom you
[1843.84 - 1849.00] hit soul searching you short of seeing
[1846.64 - 1851.04] God I think that race really put a gun
[1849.00 - 1852.44] to your head so what were the most
[1851.04 - 1854.64] difficult parts of the race you remember
[1852.44 - 1856.88] which day what moment so the most
[1854.64 - 1860.32] difficult part of the race for me was
[1856.88 - 1861.96] the long distance the 90 kilm day that
[1860.32 - 1864.24] was I think if I'm not mistaken day
[1861.96 - 1866.16] three it's the day four and the five day
[1864.24 - 1868.72] four and five day four and five and
[1866.16 - 1871.48] after that also you have a 42k du after
[1868.72 - 1872.96] you finish the 90k so it's literally
[1871.48 - 1874.88] running a marathon every day in the
[1872.96 - 1878.32] desert and one of the days was a dual
[1874.88 - 1882.04] Marathon yes and the 90k day I had one
[1878.32 - 1884.08] simple logic of that I will finish I'll
[1882.04 - 1886.44] start and I'll finish and then I will
[1884.08 - 1889.52] stop which I think the smartest thing I
[1886.44 - 1893.36] did uh but also that that day was really
[1889.52 - 1894.96] really hard in terms of the root like my
[1893.36 - 1896.52] you know it's like psychologically how
[1894.96 - 1898.60] you console yourself saying oh this is a
[1896.52 - 1899.68] long day so while it's a longest I'm
[1898.60 - 1901.92] sure the route is going to be the
[1899.68 - 1907.28] easiest so the first half of the of the
[1901.92 - 1910.04] race was horrible like it was so so craz
[1907.28 - 1913.68] tough and I remember this one tough from
[1910.04 - 1915.72] a point of view the heat the sand the
[1913.68 - 1917.48] those are those are constant that that
[1915.72 - 1920.64] is always they are they are the top
[1917.48 - 1924.00] markers always what varies is also the
[1920.64 - 1927.68] root now this had this one root which
[1924.00 - 1930.64] was like this uh bar in dry land and the
[1927.68 - 1932.80] bar in dry land is very hard it's very
[1930.64 - 1935.68] very tough to kind of walk or run in
[1932.80 - 1939.04] those terrains then it had this long
[1935.68 - 1941.64] patch of I don't know maybe 8 10 kilm
[1939.04 - 1945.32] and I have some pictures of that was it
[1941.64 - 1948.08] was so so Rocky that there's no way you
[1945.32 - 1950.44] could even maneuver your legs properly I
[1948.08 - 1953.04] remember one of my clients actually in
[1950.44 - 1955.08] his first MDS pulled out because he
[1953.04 - 1957.48] strained his ankle on this so you
[1955.08 - 1958.92] actually can't go fast right yes and so
[1957.48 - 1960.44] what happens especially when you reach
[1958.92 - 1962.16] the top of the Dune which you don't
[1960.44 - 1964.20] realize so sometimes so this one this
[1962.16 - 1966.80] the on this day you go through this
[1964.20 - 1968.12] really really extremely Rocky like big
[1966.80 - 1970.40] boulders where you have to like
[1968.12 - 1972.32] literally it's like trekking imagine if
[1970.40 - 1974.20] you're hiking up a mountain how does so
[1972.32 - 1976.64] it's pretty much like that and then and
[1974.20 - 1978.32] everyone sees Sahara just flat sand
[1976.64 - 1980.36] right no correct that's what so so so
[1978.32 - 1983.60] the dunes are like at least three floor
[1980.36 - 1985.16] four floor High Dunes which you climb
[1983.60 - 1987.12] and then you come down and then there
[1985.16 - 1989.44] are these patches where you have this
[1987.12 - 1991.00] you going through this kind of gradual
[1989.44 - 1994.20] you can't go around the Dune then the
[1991.00 - 1996.88] 250 km will become 500 km of course you
[1994.20 - 1998.16] can so there are there are flag markers
[1996.88 - 1999.68] along the way yeah there are flag
[1998.16 - 2001.80] markers along the way so you can see the
[1999.68 - 2003.60] flag marker yeah you can see the flag
[2001.80 - 2004.96] marker and do you see that Mirage effect
[2003.60 - 2006.52] of course and you see the flag marker
[2004.96 - 2009.52] looks like oh it is right there like 50
[2006.52 - 2011.08] m it's actually like probably 2 km away
[2009.52 - 2012.28] because it's it's and that's what plays
[2011.08 - 2013.96] mind games with you right that's what
[2012.28 - 2016.92] play so I'll tell you the night story of
[2013.96 - 2018.80] course and uh so so this one time I
[2016.92 - 2021.00] reach up the top of the Dune and I can't
[2018.80 - 2023.32] see anything below and I'm like what
[2021.00 - 2026.68] happened so you're standing and there is
[2023.32 - 2028.96] like a steep drop it's a drop and is the
[2026.68 - 2032.32] sun like really really so this probably
[2028.96 - 2033.76] is like 300 p.m. in the afternoon 2 3
[2032.32 - 2035.68] p.m. in the afterno sun goggles at all
[2033.76 - 2037.52] time right Sun goggles all the time you
[2035.68 - 2039.04] can only take it out once the sun is off
[2037.52 - 2040.60] and then also you don't want to because
[2039.04 - 2042.96] the sand dunes coming up so you better
[2040.60 - 2046.44] just wear something so and you use any
[2042.96 - 2050.12] special lenses no I just used Oakley uh
[2046.44 - 2052.36] prism uh standards nothing else okay and
[2050.12 - 2054.56] uh and so then and so that's one thing I
[2052.36 - 2056.32] didn't advise you about which sunglasses
[2054.56 - 2058.48] to use in the yeah so I just I just
[2056.32 - 2060.32] Googled up and I saw whatever everybody
[2058.48 - 2062.60] was was airing so I just picked up that
[2060.32 - 2065.24] so that is maybe the next MDS if you
[2062.60 - 2066.60] decide to do it we we'll Google up how
[2065.24 - 2068.88] does it's going to come come to your
[2066.60 - 2071.44] list very soon ra Ryan so so you were
[2068.88 - 2073.40] talking about this drop right yes and
[2071.44 - 2076.16] and so and so that drop so when you talk
[2073.40 - 2079.20] about the people getting hurt is is one
[2076.16 - 2080.68] such example where actually uh a lot of
[2079.20 - 2082.40] people who are used to that kind of
[2080.68 - 2083.76] going down and elevations and all that
[2082.40 - 2086.12] they were like zipping past I'm
[2083.76 - 2088.92] petrified of coming down I'm I'm always
[2086.12 - 2090.96] happy to climb but coming down like this
[2088.92 - 2092.84] like big drop was scary so they tie a
[2090.96 - 2094.28] rope and you have to hold the rope and
[2092.84 - 2097.32] then you go down now imagine you're
[2094.28 - 2099.76] going down you have walking sticks you
[2097.32 - 2102.28] have a bag on you and then you have the
[2099.76 - 2103.88] mat of of on which you sleep which is to
[2102.28 - 2105.76] the bag so you are you have something
[2103.88 - 2107.68] really bulky on your back so it
[2105.76 - 2109.04] obstructs your movement it's not like a
[2107.68 - 2110.92] free movement and then you have your
[2109.04 - 2112.48] walking sticks on you and you come down
[2110.92 - 2114.04] they come down a little bit and then
[2112.48 - 2116.20] there's no rope so then you have to go
[2114.04 - 2118.48] down on your own now as I'm scared I'm
[2116.20 - 2121.12] trying to drag my feet in through the
[2118.48 - 2123.64] sand and the next thing I know I hit my
[2121.12 - 2126.32] leg on a big boulder
[2123.64 - 2128.28] inside ouch and it was like okay so my
[2126.32 - 2129.96] right foot was full of blisters
[2128.28 - 2132.52] thankfully the left foot didn't get any
[2129.96 - 2135.08] blisters I don't know why this disparity
[2132.52 - 2137.88] but then to help that the left foot now
[2135.08 - 2139.88] had this big thud on some some Boulder
[2137.88 - 2141.56] Aisha please note this down okay that
[2139.88 - 2144.04] she got blisters on the right foot so
[2141.56 - 2146.80] for the next MDS we do uh weight load of
[2144.04 - 2149.20] the bag should be uh to the left and
[2146.80 - 2151.48] also maybe your gate analysis is more
[2149.20 - 2153.64] pressure on the right so that is correct
[2151.48 - 2155.56] we never got this in the um end
[2153.64 - 2157.68] counseling this is a point that I got in
[2155.56 - 2160.16] today wow awesome so okay so you got the
[2157.68 - 2162.08] the hurt so I got the hurt now the the
[2160.16 - 2164.52] the obviously my mind went saying oh
[2162.08 - 2167.32] gosh right is already in and
[2164.52 - 2169.20] psychologically psychologically I'm like
[2167.32 - 2170.60] I'm like oh my God what did what
[2169.20 - 2173.68] happened and it was kind of hurting
[2170.60 - 2175.96] hurting hurting so anyway so that was in
[2173.68 - 2178.24] into the 50 km this this is probably the
[2175.96 - 2180.20] 40th 50th kilometer but anyway so and
[2178.24 - 2182.32] you still had about 40 km more to go I
[2180.20 - 2185.80] still have 50 km to go because it was 90
[2182.32 - 2188.00] km day so anyways I calm down and then
[2185.80 - 2190.00] whatever I finished we went and then the
[2188.00 - 2191.96] Sun starts to go down and the route is a
[2190.00 - 2194.96] little bit nice how do you walk in the
[2191.96 - 2196.36] night so at night you just walk or you
[2194.96 - 2199.20] run because have a head lamp or
[2196.36 - 2200.72] something you have a head lamp and so my
[2199.20 - 2202.24] my were you walking with other people
[2200.72 - 2205.48] just to keep yourself motivated no I
[2202.24 - 2207.40] wasn't because uh because you I mean you
[2205.48 - 2209.00] might randomly just talk to somebody or
[2207.40 - 2211.72] something because I was all by myself
[2209.00 - 2214.36] right so it's it's not uh how safe is a
[2211.72 - 2216.32] marathon for women it's it's safe there
[2214.36 - 2218.04] are a lot of people running alone I ran
[2216.32 - 2219.84] most of the
[2218.04 - 2221.48] for our viewers because there are only
[2219.84 - 2224.36] people from the MDS is there public
[2221.48 - 2226.08] around there no there's nothing nobody
[2224.36 - 2228.16] it's in the Sahara Desert like for God's
[2226.08 - 2229.44] sake there's not even animals or there's
[2228.16 - 2233.40] there's nothing out there you see any
[2229.44 - 2235.48] animal no we only saw in some plats when
[2233.40 - 2237.12] we were crossing maybe like some
[2235.48 - 2239.68] so-called distant Village which is like
[2237.12 - 2241.36] three four houses you will probably see
[2239.68 - 2243.64] another human being or you will see some
[2241.36 - 2245.84] camels there's nothing else like there
[2243.64 - 2248.08] is nothing else there is no tree no
[2245.84 - 2250.48] plant one of the lonliest races yes it
[2248.08 - 2252.96] is it is it is so that's why I said that
[2250.48 - 2254.84] mind is very very important like I
[2252.96 - 2258.04] played all kind of games with myself I
[2254.84 - 2260.20] kind of I played anakar I uh I did
[2258.04 - 2262.92] conversations with people all my life
[2260.20 - 2264.88] you know like I I I had moments where I
[2262.92 - 2267.56] just went back from my life from where I
[2264.88 - 2270.88] remember till date you know how my life
[2267.56 - 2273.56] has been what I did almost like a um
[2270.88 - 2275.68] internal meditation yes it is it is it
[2273.56 - 2278.08] is meditative like when you when I came
[2275.68 - 2280.88] back I think I was I was a different
[2278.08 - 2283.20] person because I had like uh Aloha
[2280.88 - 2285.32] moments of saying oh you know what what
[2283.20 - 2287.28] a discovery I found you much more Cala
[2285.32 - 2289.40] in your subsequent counselings that I
[2287.28 - 2292.12] did like previously to the MDS you would
[2289.40 - 2293.56] be very agitated before a race yeah any
[2292.12 - 2294.92] marathon I got to get this I got to get
[2293.56 - 2298.16] that I got to do this you know like
[2294.92 - 2299.36] you're catching a bus to somewhere and
[2298.16 - 2302.80] now you're
[2299.36 - 2305.00] like if I miss the bus I'll walk correct
[2302.80 - 2306.96] so I see it it just brings things to
[2305.00 - 2309.32] perspective as I said that you know
[2306.96 - 2311.24] there was no luxury of say changing
[2309.32 - 2313.24] clothes I wear the same set of clothes
[2311.24 - 2314.56] for 7 days so today what about women if
[2313.24 - 2317.92] they have their mental cycle in the
[2314.56 - 2320.12] desert you figure it out and we planned
[2317.92 - 2323.04] for it right yeah you you figure it out
[2320.12 - 2325.12] I'm I'm sure there were 120 people women
[2323.04 - 2327.12] so I'm sure people had those challenges
[2325.12 - 2329.44] or whatever I mean you figured it out so
[2327.12 - 2331.16] in athletic poest what we do is we
[2329.44 - 2334.00] understand women's cycle 12 months in
[2331.16 - 2336.88] advance that's why for any marathon
[2334.00 - 2339.36] Ultra Runner or Olympic level athlete if
[2336.88 - 2343.56] you track your menstruation cycle on an
[2339.36 - 2346.44] app then you can use food or certain
[2343.56 - 2348.32] nutriceutical about one year in advance
[2346.44 - 2350.08] to slightly shift your menstruation
[2348.32 - 2353.40] cycle because if you know the MDS is on
[2350.08 - 2355.76] X date around 6 to 7 months prior you
[2353.40 - 2357.48] can plan to shift it slightly so that
[2355.76 - 2360.20] was one thing that we were you know
[2357.48 - 2363.24] working with you but um you know you
[2360.20 - 2366.32] carried all of these things and all um
[2363.24 - 2368.68] Everybody carried water and I remember
[2366.32 - 2371.60] telling you we need to get you the best
[2368.68 - 2374.76] isotonic solution which I know as a
[2371.60 - 2376.32] sports nutritionist is glucose fructose
[2374.76 - 2378.40] and the right ratio of sodium to
[2376.32 - 2379.96] potassium because you in the desert or
[2378.40 - 2381.24] anywhere for that matter you you lose
[2379.96 - 2383.36] five times the amount of sodium to
[2381.24 - 2385.80] potassium and in more sporting events of
[2383.36 - 2388.20] marathons you lose it only for one day
[2385.80 - 2391.08] and here was 5 days on the Trot but I
[2388.20 - 2393.96] think I was very uh I was very enamored
[2391.08 - 2395.96] or very startled at the same time to
[2393.96 - 2398.40] discover that many people just relied on
[2395.96 - 2400.88] Plain water so what was your experience
[2398.40 - 2403.16] with hydration what was your experience
[2400.88 - 2406.84] with the one Chase and how did it help
[2403.16 - 2410.28] you out um at the Sahara MDS I still
[2406.84 - 2412.24] remember the taste of that decoction I
[2410.28 - 2415.64] used to make in the morning when I used
[2412.24 - 2418.48] to leave the camp like by the day sixth
[2415.64 - 2421.04] I was like cursing you saying Ryan I
[2418.48 - 2423.64] cannot have this another day of my life
[2421.04 - 2426.64] but you didn't CR but that was the
[2423.64 - 2428.48] reason I think I was able to sustain
[2426.64 - 2431.72] through those seven days in this brutal
[2428.48 - 2433.84] he is because I had my hydration in
[2431.72 - 2436.48] place when I say hydration is not just
[2433.84 - 2438.16] about water it was Al it was about the
[2436.48 - 2440.40] electrolytes I was getting I had the
[2438.16 - 2442.08] right portion and the right mix of
[2440.40 - 2444.80] whatever I needed to sustain because
[2442.08 - 2446.16] you're losing salt at such a fast pace
[2444.80 - 2448.52] could you see the white salts on your
[2446.16 - 2450.40] outfit everything was white everybody
[2448.52 - 2452.24] everything was white the other the other
[2450.40 - 2454.60] Runners also yes everything was white
[2452.24 - 2456.20] you could you could feel it by the time
[2454.60 - 2458.84] you would come back and your body is so
[2456.20 - 2460.72] heated because of of uh you know like
[2458.84 - 2462.80] you're wearing Gator so your foot is
[2460.72 - 2464.44] kind of really boiling ins G just for
[2462.80 - 2466.84] the general audience in India who's
[2464.44 - 2469.00] never seen a desert what are gators so
[2466.84 - 2472.32] Gators are like shoe covers like imagine
[2469.00 - 2475.40] a socks that you wear over a shoe it it
[2472.32 - 2478.48] is kind of uh stuck to your shoe with a
[2475.40 - 2481.32] velcro uh it prevents for any sand to go
[2478.48 - 2483.24] inside but did sand go in no but you
[2481.32 - 2485.00] have to wear a gator to run in a in a
[2483.24 - 2487.40] sand you get snow Gators as well which
[2485.00 - 2489.64] protects you from it getting wet and not
[2487.40 - 2491.40] snow not getting into your uh shoes and
[2489.64 - 2493.12] socks so you have to wear a sand Gator
[2491.40 - 2495.36] the job of it is that sand doesn't go
[2493.12 - 2497.52] inside your foat now the challenge with
[2495.36 - 2500.68] gators is that it becomes your it's like
[2497.52 - 2503.00] heat sealed inside so that is why you
[2500.68 - 2504.40] get blisters and hot what was what was
[2503.00 - 2508.00] the peak temperature during the day
[2504.40 - 2511.68] around 4850 4850 we would start at like
[2508.00 - 2513.72] 40 this year so uh I think anyone doing
[2511.68 - 2514.88] the MDS this year is going to be uh
[2513.72 - 2517.88] crucial because it's going to be the
[2514.88 - 2520.16] hottest summer on the planet yeah it it
[2517.88 - 2522.44] it was it was a it was the H shoes melt
[2520.16 - 2524.12] in any way no it didn't because uh
[2522.44 - 2526.36] thanks to my shoes but I did have a
[2524.12 - 2528.20] teammate who Sho did you use for the I
[2526.36 - 2531.44] wore Solomon I've always done all my
[2528.20 - 2534.80] Trails uh with Solomon I am a big I I
[2531.44 - 2536.52] believe they are the best and you know
[2534.80 - 2539.04] when we talking about one Chase being
[2536.52 - 2542.48] the the uh I I remember you sending me a
[2539.04 - 2544.48] picture of one Chase in the desert yes
[2542.48 - 2547.24] and I was like I was so proud because
[2544.48 - 2549.20] being the creator of isotonic solution
[2547.24 - 2551.44] like what would you ask you wanted to
[2549.20 - 2553.28] enhance performance in people but then
[2551.44 - 2556.28] when you put that in the Sahara desert
[2553.28 - 2559.00] in the sand you know it just gives you a
[2556.28 - 2561.52] perspective 5 days in the desert
[2559.00 - 2563.88] isotonic but you shared one story that a
[2561.52 - 2565.28] lot of people did cramp and were were
[2563.88 - 2567.96] were lost on Race because they had no
[2565.28 - 2569.44] knowledge about how to hydrate so I will
[2567.96 - 2572.08] tell you a simple example and I was
[2569.44 - 2574.28] surprised because we assume that the
[2572.08 - 2576.24] Western people are far more educated
[2574.28 - 2578.72] than us here in India and you said that
[2576.24 - 2582.72] many came with just absolutely nothing
[2578.72 - 2585.16] so one of my tent mates the day one uh
[2582.72 - 2586.60] when we finished we were like the day
[2585.16 - 2588.76] one we were like close by we thought
[2586.60 - 2590.40] okay we'll run together I was new I was
[2588.76 - 2592.68] a little skeptical so we started with
[2590.40 - 2594.60] them and then of course I I moved ahead
[2592.68 - 2596.12] and then uh they they came a little
[2594.60 - 2598.96] later and when we kind of pretty much
[2596.12 - 2600.56] finished nearby he came and he fainted
[2598.96 - 2604.00] at the finish line that was day one
[2600.56 - 2606.64] fainted hasn't collapsed yeah okay at
[2604.00 - 2610.00] like at the camp on day one now he's he
[2606.64 - 2611.96] is a he's a tri athlete he's done one of
[2610.00 - 2614.64] uh the hardest full Iron Mans in the
[2611.96 - 2616.52] world he has done like I don't know some
[2614.64 - 2617.96] 100 days solo sailing and stuff like
[2616.52 - 2620.60] that so he does this like the back of
[2617.96 - 2622.84] his hand but of course he's from UK and
[2620.60 - 2624.72] he's not used to this kind of heat he
[2622.84 - 2627.72] was not prepared you're more tropical he
[2624.72 - 2630.16] did he didn't have he was not taking any
[2627.72 - 2632.24] electrolytes and he was just like that
[2630.16 - 2634.48] I'm genuinely surprised because
[2632.24 - 2637.08] Triathlon Iron Man you know you got to
[2634.48 - 2639.28] be educated that Sports Nutrition
[2637.08 - 2641.16] nutrition is so important because
[2639.28 - 2644.00] because Ryan nobody's nobody wants to
[2641.16 - 2645.68] spend on nutrition speak speaking of
[2644.00 - 2647.96] spending how much are you spend for the
[2645.68 - 2650.12] MDS what's the what's the entry fee to
[2647.96 - 2654.20] enter the MDS today uh
[2650.12 - 2656.52] 4500 pound to register wow that's a lot
[2654.20 - 2659.80] of money and then the gear that you have
[2656.52 - 2663.04] to place in place adds up to I don't
[2659.80 - 2665.92] know I mean maybe about uh
[2663.04 - 2668.56] $22,000 so you're spending about 10,000
[2665.92 - 2671.08] I spent about approximately 7 to 8 lakhs
[2668.56 - 2673.16] just the race I'm not considering my
[2671.08 - 2675.52] training my nutrition all of that I'm
[2673.16 - 2677.76] keeping aside because that's my regular
[2675.52 - 2679.48] expense for example so for the Indian
[2677.76 - 2681.16] audience out there if you to prepare for
[2679.48 - 2683.64] the MDS you're looking at about a 15
[2681.16 - 2686.24] lakh expenditure and I mean if they go
[2683.64 - 2688.64] through nutrition the training the phys
[2686.24 - 2691.52] the running coach yes anywhere between
[2688.64 - 2694.04] 10 to 12 lakhs for sure if you want to
[2691.52 - 2695.60] be like supercharged Mercedes-Benz side
[2694.04 - 2697.64] you you go a little bit higher on your
[2695.60 - 2699.48] expenditure yeah because because see
[2697.64 - 2702.28] some of those things like so this is not
[2699.48 - 2705.60] something a student can do well if the
[2702.28 - 2708.40] father's Rich he or she can or or they
[2705.60 - 2710.64] get good sponsors were you sponsored no
[2708.40 - 2712.80] nobody nobody's sponsored we are open
[2710.64 - 2714.24] for sponsorship for the next MDS you
[2712.80 - 2716.04] give us the money we're going to the
[2714.24 - 2717.88] Sahara I I'll be the guy that sits in
[2716.04 - 2719.28] the Moroccan hotel watching TV and like
[2717.88 - 2721.44] okay where is she at this point in the
[2719.28 - 2722.76] race yeah they have they have a GPS
[2721.44 - 2724.64] tracker so you can actually track me
[2722.76 - 2726.16] where I am were you were were people in
[2724.64 - 2727.56] the MDS allowed to contact their
[2726.16 - 2729.48] families you had
[2727.56 - 2731.56] there is no network talk to me about no
[2729.48 - 2733.96] phones what about that there's no phone
[2731.56 - 2735.56] there's phone there's no phone there's
[2733.96 - 2738.04] no network there's no charging option
[2735.56 - 2739.56] you carry your either charger uh like a
[2738.04 - 2741.04] power bank car you carried a power bank
[2739.56 - 2742.48] right I carried a power bank I don't
[2741.04 - 2743.76] know why I carried it so next time I'm
[2742.48 - 2745.76] not going to carry phone I can just
[2743.76 - 2748.40] shave off like at least 500 G by not
[2745.76 - 2750.28] carrying those right I know phone I can
[2748.40 - 2753.08] shave off 500 G to you and me like what
[2750.28 - 2755.28] is 500 G when you have to go 5 days
[2753.08 - 2757.80] through the desert Ryan you're saying
[2755.28 - 2759.44] that you remember the toothbrush I cut
[2757.80 - 2762.72] off the tail of the toothbrush because
[2759.44 - 2764.48] it saved me 10 G like you telling me you
[2762.72 - 2765.88] you know what we did Afters we found the
[2764.48 - 2767.76] baby tooth brush which you put on your
[2765.88 - 2769.24] thumb and you that's what you told me
[2767.76 - 2771.40] but I said you know what in the sand it
[2769.24 - 2773.00] might get lost and I won't have one then
[2771.40 - 2775.24] then now then I actually thought I said
[2773.00 - 2777.16] why do I even need a toothbrush it's not
[2775.24 - 2779.00] like I'm having shower and I'm you know
[2777.16 - 2780.88] jelling my hair and coming out like this
[2779.00 - 2782.84] I'm like you're in sand and dust so I
[2780.88 - 2784.48] said next time I told I said I don't
[2782.84 - 2786.48] even need a toothbrush you know I'm
[2784.48 - 2789.72] going to carry and I carried that tiny
[2786.48 - 2791.04] two piece paste uh but I do have a list
[2789.72 - 2792.16] of things that I'm not going to carry
[2791.04 - 2795.64] next year do you have photographs of
[2792.16 - 2797.20] that I I mean I'm sure I have yeah let's
[2795.64 - 2799.44] put these photographs up in the podcast
[2797.20 - 2802.76] so people can see these it
[2799.44 - 2806.04] was insane the kind of stuff I uh I did
[2802.76 - 2808.04] but carried but there is an option of uh
[2806.04 - 2811.60] using satellite phone which is at an
[2808.04 - 2816.24] additional cost to call uh home and I
[2811.60 - 2818.96] did call I think after uh the long day
[2816.24 - 2822.24] after the third day I think and okay the
[2818.96 - 2826.16] the the most amazing or The Lovable part
[2822.24 - 2827.88] of MDS okay uh you you go you day one
[2826.16 - 2829.48] you finish and then this lady so there
[2827.88 - 2831.52] are dedicated people who take care of
[2829.48 - 2834.08] tents like you know like tent managers
[2831.52 - 2835.28] so to say so they come any announcement
[2834.08 - 2837.12] anything they have to give and all of
[2835.28 - 2838.72] that they come and give 10 by 10 by 10
[2837.12 - 2840.56] because there is no like big mic and all
[2838.72 - 2841.84] of that happening so this lady comes in
[2840.56 - 2844.52] the evening with a bunch of paper
[2841.84 - 2846.48] printouts and they call out and they
[2844.52 - 2849.04] give those papers now take a wild guess
[2846.48 - 2852.20] what those papers are emails from home
[2849.04 - 2855.84] yes they have letters from friends and
[2852.20 - 2857.28] family who have sent emails to us on day
[2855.84 - 2860.12] one what was very interesting nobody
[2857.28 - 2863.36] sent me email the LA the previous year
[2860.12 - 2866.12] my bib number 917 that person sent me an
[2863.36 - 2868.12] email saying I was 917 you're doing very
[2866.12 - 2871.92] well you know that person was tracking
[2868.12 - 2873.52] meow and and complete stranger who's
[2871.92 - 2876.28] never met I don't know who that person
[2873.52 - 2878.84] is he was 917 the previous year so today
[2876.28 - 2880.56] this year I I know the two word is 917
[2878.84 - 2883.60] I'm going to send that person an email
[2880.56 - 2887.20] so only an MDS veteran knows what it is
[2883.60 - 2888.80] to be broken and do that race and what
[2887.20 - 2890.80] that the words of encouragement mean for
[2888.80 - 2893.20] the next person and then and so that
[2890.80 - 2895.48] when you know now from the day next day
[2893.20 - 2898.76] onwards everybody would like we would
[2895.48 - 2903.16] all wait and I had whole bunch of people
[2898.76 - 2905.36] like my my boss my physio you everybody
[2903.16 - 2907.44] sent emails for the next six seven days
[2905.36 - 2909.24] and we remember we used to read out
[2907.44 - 2911.00] those emails and we literally used to
[2909.24 - 2913.16] cry why why would you read out the
[2911.00 - 2915.76] emails everyone in the tent would listen
[2913.16 - 2918.64] in yeah yeah we would share like we
[2915.76 - 2921.00] would share comments like some some
[2918.64 - 2922.80] people had their kids writing in and
[2921.00 - 2924.60] they would have funny jokes or you know
[2922.80 - 2926.48] somebody had I would jump and say oh you
[2924.60 - 2928.40] know what my boss sent me an email like
[2926.48 - 2930.24] for God's sake when I'm off work she
[2928.40 - 2931.84] should be cursing me and she was there
[2930.24 - 2933.40] cheering and supporting for me that's
[2931.84 - 2935.60] something that you would want to share
[2933.40 - 2937.96] so we would share and we would cry and
[2935.60 - 2940.84] you know it was it was like those the
[2937.96 - 2942.92] the tent becomes your family you share
[2940.84 - 2945.04] those moments which are so special does
[2942.92 - 2947.20] it give you does it give you hope that
[2945.04 - 2949.24] humans can connect anywhere in the world
[2947.20 - 2951.48] oh yes especially if you're put in a
[2949.24 - 2953.52] situation like this in a state of Crisis
[2951.48 - 2956.76] and survival I think you become the best
[2953.52 - 2958.44] of the friends I I mean uh I'm going to
[2956.76 - 2960.88] London now so I'm really looking forward
[2958.44 - 2963.64] to meeting all of them and and there are
[2960.88 - 2965.80] people who you Bor really well with and
[2963.64 - 2968.88] uh I met one of them at Berlin last year
[2965.80 - 2970.76] in September so I especially if you're
[2968.88 - 2972.40] put into this kind of distress situation
[2970.76 - 2973.80] you know it happens in a lot in
[2972.40 - 2975.80] professional lives also if you have a
[2973.80 - 2978.36] bad boss then the team really really
[2975.80 - 2980.96] bonds very well because the pain point
[2978.36 - 2983.04] is the same we all relate to ourselves
[2980.96 - 2985.00] we were at MDS the same situation we
[2983.04 - 2987.72] were all away from home we were not in
[2985.00 - 2989.88] touch we were we were we were getting
[2987.72 - 2991.84] going through putting ourselves to this
[2989.88 - 2994.48] whole pain or whatever so we obviously
[2991.84 - 2997.32] had each other to kind of share and
[2994.48 - 2998.92] nobody understood our pain better
[2997.32 - 3001.16] than the people who were there
[2998.92 - 3003.28] themselves like you know I I had the
[3001.16 - 3006.12] most amazing experience like there was
[3003.28 - 3008.48] this there was my neighbor and somehow
[3006.12 - 3010.28] he was like the fir man he would lit the
[3008.48 - 3013.24] fire and I was never successful in
[3010.28 - 3015.48] lighting that fire to heat the water so
[3013.24 - 3017.32] okay so you needed the fire for warming
[3015.48 - 3019.44] heting the water is what you will put in
[3017.32 - 3021.00] your food then that food will become
[3019.44 - 3023.52] edible right otherwise this is all that
[3021.00 - 3025.08] dried stuff that we were carrying so and
[3023.52 - 3027.24] and then of course I needed my coffee in
[3025.08 - 3028.76] the morning so it was his job he would
[3027.24 - 3030.92] wake him say do you want some hot water
[3028.76 - 3032.92] sh in his English and I would say oh yes
[3030.92 - 3034.20] of course why not and then he would make
[3032.92 - 3037.12] that so how do you heat the water you
[3034.20 - 3039.96] would have butane torch or paraffin
[3037.12 - 3042.00] candles we had these uh little and one
[3039.96 - 3044.32] tiny little stuff which which weighed I
[3042.00 - 3046.52] think some 20 gam or something and then
[3044.32 - 3048.16] it had those uh tablets which you which
[3046.52 - 3049.96] you pre-order and you carry at the camp
[3048.16 - 3052.08] because you can't carry in the flight
[3049.96 - 3053.72] and then uh they lit up you light them
[3052.08 - 3056.36] and then there's fire it takes a lot of
[3053.72 - 3058.92] while because it's open it's windy there
[3056.36 - 3061.04] is Sandstorm putting bags so you're
[3058.92 - 3062.92] trying to put uh like yeah like there's
[3061.04 - 3064.64] one time I think two twice actually
[3062.92 - 3066.96] there's like a big fire lit up in front
[3064.64 - 3069.12] of some tent so we were we were at the
[3066.96 - 3070.56] outside so it was easier for it was
[3069.12 - 3072.24] easier for us that nothing would go on
[3070.56 - 3073.92] to fire but it's very difficult to light
[3072.24 - 3075.44] one because there was like open air
[3073.92 - 3079.60] coming up how many people took part in
[3075.44 - 3082.76] the MDS 1200 this year and we had 40%
[3079.60 - 3084.52] almost 40% drop out 1,200 people take
[3082.76 - 3088.64] part in the most grueling race on the
[3084.52 - 3090.20] planet and 40% drop out so this year
[3088.64 - 3093.56] they don't drop out they they don't beat
[3090.20 - 3095.60] the cut right no the people do drop out
[3093.56 - 3098.28] because uh anyone drop out from your
[3095.60 - 3101.28] tent yes day two what was the reason day
[3098.28 - 3104.00] two he dropped out and he he uh he just
[3101.28 - 3107.28] injury or just I can't do it I can't do
[3104.00 - 3109.20] it I can't do it because it's a see it's
[3107.28 - 3111.68] all the Indians all the Indians are
[3109.20 - 3113.76] asking do we get a refund on the
[3111.68 - 3115.36] funny you're you're you're you're like
[3113.76 - 3119.04] you're like it's it's it's like once
[3115.36 - 3121.24] paid it's it's like marriage once done
[3119.04 - 3122.52] you can't be not married again all the
[3121.24 - 3125.08] business Community when you enter the
[3122.52 - 3126.76] MDS remember no refund so you have to
[3125.08 - 3128.36] complete the MDS yeah yeah it's it's
[3126.76 - 3129.60] like after spending all of that money
[3128.36 - 3131.60] you spend the same money whether you
[3129.60 - 3133.48] finish or you not finished so you better
[3131.60 - 3135.12] decide what you want to do it speaking
[3133.48 - 3137.84] of spending money you know I want to
[3135.12 - 3141.00] take a U-turn into what we have been to
[3137.84 - 3144.16] doing the last few years
[3141.00 - 3147.20] together you're one of the very few
[3144.16 - 3150.24] marathon runners in the country who
[3147.20 - 3151.56] invest in um Sports nutrition plan many
[3150.24 - 3153.92] people do Sports nutrition plan they do
[3151.56 - 3155.08] 3 months 6 months 12 months they do it
[3153.92 - 3156.60] with people like me or Sports
[3155.08 - 3159.24] nutritionist or at my Kaa nutrition
[3156.60 - 3161.36] clinic or with the various dietitians
[3159.24 - 3164.20] nutritionist out there or even the
[3161.36 - 3166.04] running coaches do nutrition uh plans
[3164.20 - 3167.80] but people do it like 3 months 6 months
[3166.04 - 3170.20] and all we've been together now for
[3167.80 - 3172.00] years I think four years running now or
[3170.20 - 3175.16] 5 years
[3172.00 - 3179.12] running what's your thought process as
[3175.16 - 3184.16] an elite Runner as an endurance Runner
[3179.12 - 3186.48] as a woman runner on spending money on a
[3184.16 - 3188.72] nutrition advisory
[3186.48 - 3190.64] plan I will tell you something that my
[3188.72 - 3193.52] mom told me and I will
[3190.64 - 3196.40] remember this moment I was sitting at
[3193.52 - 3199.28] the Morocco airport to come back home
[3196.40 - 3201.08] and after the race I was just like I was
[3199.28 - 3202.44] I was to extend my trip and come back
[3201.08 - 3203.92] but then I preponed it and I said you
[3202.44 - 3206.24] know what I'm done I want to just get
[3203.92 - 3208.84] home and there's always said thing no
[3206.24 - 3211.80] let's get home yeah it's like I think I
[3208.84 - 3217.44] had had enough when I was alone lonely
[3211.80 - 3219.04] like beaten broken uh but yet a new me
[3217.44 - 3221.84] and I think I just was waiting to come
[3219.04 - 3224.04] back to the Comfort so my so there were
[3221.84 - 3227.20] two things that one my dad said and one
[3224.04 - 3230.48] my mom said my dad never
[3227.20 - 3232.36] appreciated me doing this and of course
[3230.48 - 3235.44] splurging all the money that I
[3232.36 - 3238.24] do uh but he said that you know maybe I
[3235.44 - 3240.80] should have supported you more more uh
[3238.24 - 3243.00] and I'm so proud of you I think that
[3240.80 - 3245.28] weighed to me as much as my MDS medal
[3243.00 - 3247.56] does but the interesting part that my
[3245.28 - 3250.40] mother said was that you were able to do
[3247.56 - 3252.72] this because for all these years the way
[3250.40 - 3255.52] you've taken care of your body
[3252.72 - 3257.76] especially with your food is why you
[3255.52 - 3260.00] were able to sustain these seven days
[3257.76 - 3262.64] because this your body had been prepared
[3260.00 - 3265.32] for for years it was not that we started
[3262.64 - 3267.40] one Mon it's not a project you know the
[3265.32 - 3270.52] point I'm trying to tell is that people
[3267.40 - 3273.40] take uh nutrition as a
[3270.52 - 3275.08] project I will do this and then I will
[3273.40 - 3276.44] learn and then I will do I don't think
[3275.08 - 3279.08] I've learned in like we're going to
[3276.44 - 3282.04] finish four years and start five I don't
[3279.08 - 3284.72] think I've learned and and there is
[3282.04 - 3287.96] nothing that I can learn I understand
[3284.72 - 3289.72] I'm more educated to see you know what
[3287.96 - 3291.48] to eat what is good for me you've given
[3289.72 - 3294.64] me that sense but can I do this on my
[3291.48 - 3297.44] own of course not so I think people
[3294.64 - 3300.08] treat this you know they want to do it
[3297.44 - 3302.04] but they do not treat their body with
[3300.08 - 3304.04] that love and care and I go back to
[3302.04 - 3306.76] saying that it is it is my definition of
[3304.04 - 3309.24] self love that I want to ensure that
[3306.76 - 3311.76] while I'm doing the sport with my age
[3309.24 - 3313.52] going through this grueling experiences
[3311.76 - 3315.40] I have to take care of my body at all
[3313.52 - 3317.56] times and that means that I have to have
[3315.40 - 3320.12] the right nutrition in place it's not
[3317.56 - 3322.24] about eras it is about my day-to-day at
[3320.12 - 3324.32] my age I don't have any diseases
[3322.24 - 3326.60] considering from the family history I
[3324.32 - 3328.32] have I can be bragging about about it
[3326.60 - 3330.04] and I think I'm able to do it only
[3328.32 - 3333.44] because I have worked with you for all
[3330.04 - 3335.00] these years so I mean I don't I honestly
[3333.44 - 3338.16] don't understand why people wouldn't
[3335.00 - 3340.60] spend on staying healthy and happy I
[3338.16 - 3342.24] think you know you have defined the
[3340.60 - 3344.92] perspective that your body is the most
[3342.24 - 3347.52] expensive real estate it is and you're
[3344.92 - 3350.28] living in it as a landlord you're not
[3347.52 - 3353.28] living in it as a tenant which what I
[3350.28 - 3356.32] sees many marathon runners ultramarathon
[3353.28 - 3357.72] Runners and even 5K 10K Runners everyone
[3356.32 - 3360.00] like Oh I'm a tenant in my board you
[3357.72 - 3361.64] know they'll take some cursory advice
[3360.00 - 3364.32] off the internet and do it and stuff
[3361.64 - 3367.64] like that it's like this that you know
[3364.32 - 3370.72] you're okay to spend whatever lacks of
[3367.64 - 3373.08] money on the doctor but you don't want
[3370.72 - 3375.08] to prevent spending that money I'm not
[3373.08 - 3377.12] saying that I may not need to spend that
[3375.08 - 3379.08] money but at least I'm giving my body a
[3377.12 - 3382.04] fair chance to not spend that money so
[3379.08 - 3385.08] why wouldn't I do it right so so the
[3382.04 - 3387.52] Wonders that you've got in nutrition uh
[3385.08 - 3389.76] which which you've continue to sustain
[3387.52 - 3392.60] you've continue to
[3389.76 - 3394.00] invest and for everyone out there who
[3392.60 - 3395.48] keeps picking up the phone like I want
[3394.00 - 3398.32] to work with celebrity Nutri Ryan
[3395.48 - 3401.60] Fernando I do not work free with people
[3398.32 - 3403.16] scha invests her hard-earned money in my
[3401.60 - 3404.20] nutritional Services where am I going
[3403.16 - 3407.64] with this
[3404.20 - 3410.08] point year on year you keep investing
[3407.64 - 3412.56] you know you're a lady who would carry a
[3410.08 - 3415.64] Lou Von Gucci bag but from a thought
[3412.56 - 3417.60] process you'd like I'd buy a better shoe
[3415.64 - 3420.12] I'd buy a better running outfit I'd get
[3417.60 - 3422.76] a better diet I'd invest in a running
[3420.12 - 3425.84] coach I'd invest in a mind coach rather
[3422.76 - 3427.88] than carry that bag which is
[3425.84 - 3430.76] materialistic but you see it internally
[3427.88 - 3432.56] to you so when you are investing what
[3430.76 - 3435.80] are some of the Wonders that you have
[3432.56 - 3438.16] seen from nutrition like are there like
[3435.80 - 3439.60] some nice things that you hate doing
[3438.16 - 3441.40] like look look how I say this nice
[3439.60 - 3443.40] things that you hate doing first thing
[3441.40 - 3446.00] in the morning um what are things that
[3443.40 - 3448.96] you love from a nutrition perspective
[3446.00 - 3451.24] and and what are the changes that you
[3448.96 - 3453.20] have seen in nutrition for example you
[3451.24 - 3456.32] started following something and what was
[3453.20 - 3458.76] the outcome of that so so on a lighter
[3456.32 - 3461.36] note my LV bag wouldn't get me sitting
[3458.76 - 3463.52] here but my investment has been right so
[3461.36 - 3465.00] I can there is Ari to my investment as
[3463.52 - 3467.92] people can see here I'm sitting with
[3465.00 - 3472.08] celebrity nutritionist Ryan Fernando so
[3467.92 - 3474.36] I think I did it well and right uh you
[3472.08 - 3477.64] could probably buy four Louis Von bags
[3474.36 - 3480.52] with the MDS people people just like oh
[3477.64 - 3482.08] you have you are with how much is Ryan
[3480.52 - 3483.84] charge and I'm like that's none of your
[3482.08 - 3485.32] business well like you know go ask Ryan
[3483.84 - 3487.52] how much he charges are you interested
[3485.32 - 3488.88] in training with him then just go you
[3487.52 - 3490.60] know then they say oh you have a coach
[3488.88 - 3492.28] who's in the US how much does he charge
[3490.60 - 3494.16] everything is all about money like you
[3492.28 - 3496.60] have a coach in the US I have a coach in
[3494.16 - 3498.40] the US who does my running training I've
[3496.60 - 3500.92] been with him for as long as a little
[3498.40 - 3505.20] longer than I've been with you I have a
[3500.92 - 3507.60] coach who does my uh gym and uh you know
[3505.20 - 3509.80] the whole Mobility agility Etc I also am
[3507.60 - 3511.96] a regular with the physio you know it's
[3509.80 - 3514.60] like because to me recovery is most
[3511.96 - 3517.36] important uh you know and I think I
[3514.60 - 3520.64] think it's it's about training
[3517.36 - 3523.00] performance recovery uh and and my
[3520.64 - 3525.32] General Wellness so I think all of that
[3523.00 - 3527.24] then coming to your question I think
[3525.32 - 3529.28] there's just so many I I just don't know
[3527.24 - 3531.68] where to start but I think the first
[3529.28 - 3533.20] thing that you got me gluten-free you
[3531.68 - 3537.04] know
[3533.20 - 3538.68] I I have always had Roy being a b
[3537.04 - 3541.40] I've never been a rice fan I've always
[3538.68 - 3542.92] right chapati like I remember growing up
[3541.40 - 3544.48] I used to we didn't have a concept of
[3542.92 - 3547.56] making Roti at home but I always thought
[3544.48 - 3550.40] bengalis ate rice yeah I didn't oh you
[3547.56 - 3552.32] was you're an outli I've been I'm born
[3550.40 - 3554.48] outlier I think I used to get roties
[3552.32 - 3557.04] from Neighbors or sometimes even from
[3554.48 - 3558.32] hotel I've even eaten bread for dinner
[3557.04 - 3560.36] because I didn't want to eat rice
[3558.32 - 3563.08] because I've never been fond of rice
[3560.36 - 3565.76] even today I will I would like a Biryani
[3563.08 - 3567.72] or a fried rice but like rice is like
[3565.76 - 3569.36] one once in a while occasional treat is
[3567.72 - 3571.40] fine I'm not like a rice fan so the
[3569.36 - 3573.32] first and Ive always had this whole
[3571.40 - 3576.04] problem of sinus and all of that I think
[3573.32 - 3579.56] when you got me to gluten and lactose
[3576.04 - 3581.72] free was the first time I saw today I
[3579.56 - 3585.08] can differentiate I know that when I eat
[3581.72 - 3587.32] gluten what happens to me so I you know
[3585.08 - 3590.28] I think that was the biggest
[3587.32 - 3593.40] lifechanging advice or correction you
[3590.28 - 3596.36] got into my life first also I had seen
[3593.40 - 3599.36] my dad he would always say when I I eat
[3596.36 - 3601.04] Roy my stomach gets upset now what are
[3599.36 - 3602.96] the chances that he's actually gluten
[3601.04 - 3605.36] intolerant or allergic but he doesn't
[3602.96 - 3607.24] know because nobody nobody did the gene
[3605.36 - 3608.92] test and figured it out and all of that
[3607.24 - 3610.68] like so I think that was the first it's
[3608.92 - 3612.20] a turning point in my life if I would
[3610.68 - 3615.72] say because I have struggled with
[3612.20 - 3618.52] sinusitis till I met Ryan Fernando so I
[3615.72 - 3620.76] think I would I owe you for this big
[3618.52 - 3623.24] time outside of whatever money I pay you
[3620.76 - 3626.16] number one number two is that with my
[3623.24 - 3628.28] age to be year on year working on per
[3626.16 - 3630.16] performance I don't think would be
[3628.28 - 3632.68] possible if I wouldn't be working with
[3630.16 - 3636.48] you you actually sorry to interrupt you
[3632.68 - 3638.80] you actually did about 140 km last week
[3636.48 - 3642.04] 146 146
[3638.80 - 3644.12] kilm I've not even driven that distance
[3642.04 - 3645.96] in one week scha has run that distance
[3644.12 - 3649.00] in one week so that gives you the
[3645.96 - 3652.24] perspective of the pounding she does to
[3649.00 - 3654.48] her body and how young she looks and I'm
[3652.24 - 3657.00] not allowed to reveal her age but she's
[3654.48 - 3659.00] really young at heart really young in
[3657.00 - 3660.84] cellular age that's because of the
[3659.00 - 3664.88] nutrition that she puts into your body
[3660.84 - 3666.60] so also like that you mentioned 46 km
[3664.88 - 3668.52] and on average I train two to three
[3666.60 - 3672.08] hours every day I have a full-time job
[3668.52 - 3675.96] as well so how do you manage family
[3672.08 - 3678.20] parents your partner your boss your
[3675.96 - 3679.36] company because people think that okay
[3678.20 - 3681.40] like this lady must be running then
[3679.36 - 3684.20] going off to sleep walk us through your
[3681.40 - 3687.08] day I never get to run and go to sleep
[3684.20 - 3688.60] like never but it's like I I I I finish
[3687.08 - 3690.52] running and then by then My Gym trainer
[3688.60 - 3692.56] is calling ma'am gym I'm like yeah yeah
[3690.52 - 3694.00] coming wait yeah like is likea where are
[3692.56 - 3695.24] you the podcast going to start yeah I'm
[3694.00 - 3696.92] just finishing my run and coming so
[3695.24 - 3698.20] she's actually finished her run and then
[3696.92 - 3701.28] come for the podcast that's how
[3698.20 - 3703.88] disciplined mahasa is yeah I mean I I
[3701.28 - 3707.76] just I just think that I manage because
[3703.88 - 3709.52] I I like you say in MBA you're taught
[3707.76 - 3713.16] right that if you cannot measure you
[3709.52 - 3715.52] cannot manage and I think we don't we
[3713.16 - 3717.52] apply it only to sales numbers I apply
[3715.52 - 3721.56] to my life life I just see that I have
[3717.52 - 3723.88] 24 hours I need a good quality 6 hour
[3721.56 - 3726.92] sleep is good enough for me you know if
[3723.88 - 3729.44] I'm if I'm and people relate recovery
[3726.92 - 3730.92] and rest to sleep recovery and rest
[3729.44 - 3732.84] happens through the day it happens
[3730.92 - 3734.60] through the damn food that you're eating
[3732.84 - 3737.16] it happens to your state of mind that
[3734.60 - 3740.00] you are in it it could even happen to
[3737.16 - 3741.96] just get up and look outside and take
[3740.00 - 3743.64] few deep breaths is recovery good enough
[3741.96 - 3745.44] but people don't see it like that people
[3743.64 - 3747.24] say oh my God you know I need to sleep
[3745.44 - 3749.56] 10 hours if I run for two I mean nobody
[3747.24 - 3751.36] needs to sleep for 10 hours so I'm a big
[3749.56 - 3752.88] fan of sadguru he's he sleeps for like
[3751.36 - 3756.72] for 3 4 hours that's where I would love
[3752.88 - 3758.76] to go to so uh and then I I just I just
[3756.72 - 3762.80] finish my training I eat what you tell
[3758.76 - 3764.24] me to eat I it's like so when I eat or I
[3762.80 - 3766.84] go somewhere I have the saying that what
[3764.24 - 3770.32] would Ryan react to this and Trust You
[3766.84 - 3772.32] me that is my first reaction saying Ryan
[3770.32 - 3775.08] will die if he sees me eating this I
[3772.32 - 3777.88] cannot eat this so that's my reaction
[3775.08 - 3779.96] but uh uh but I I just I think it's just
[3777.88 - 3782.36] easy I only spend I recently did a
[3779.96 - 3785.12] presentation when I said the winning
[3782.36 - 3788.24] margin and the winning margin is I split
[3785.12 - 3791.36] my day hours into how I split it and
[3788.24 - 3794.52] only 8% of my whole day is what I spend
[3791.36 - 3797.28] into my passion which is Fitness only 8%
[3794.52 - 3800.16] only 8% the that's still two hours a day
[3797.28 - 3802.52] right yeah but it is only 8% you still
[3800.16 - 3804.84] have 92% of your time to do what you
[3802.52 - 3806.16] want to do the the point I'm trying to
[3804.84 - 3807.88] make is that it's not that I have
[3806.16 - 3809.80] anything extra is that that it's a
[3807.88 - 3812.16] choice I have made you know instead of
[3809.80 - 3814.04] going and binging at Netflix for 2 hours
[3812.16 - 3816.32] I would rather go and do my run you know
[3814.04 - 3818.64] instead of trying and sitting somewhere
[3816.32 - 3820.28] and and I do coffee after every single
[3818.64 - 3822.40] day after my run I do coffee with my
[3820.28 - 3824.60] friends time right it's my yeah I mean
[3822.40 - 3826.80] everybody knows that 7:30 she is found
[3824.60 - 3829.84] at the cafe respective like if I don't
[3826.80 - 3831.76] go then the coffee guy will ask go
[3829.84 - 3833.84] Madam like you know it's the cutest
[3831.76 - 3837.72] thing I hear and then I come back I get
[3833.84 - 3841.04] to work I have a as you know I had uh uh
[3837.72 - 3843.28] marketing for a big IT company uh
[3841.04 - 3845.48] worldwide so my job is taxing I put
[3843.28 - 3847.36] about 8 to nine hours of my job and
[3845.48 - 3848.52] that's mental thinking right yeah it's
[3847.36 - 3850.24] mental thinking it's different if it's
[3848.52 - 3852.24] just physical labor or something CU you
[3850.24 - 3855.08] could be mentally absent and this do
[3852.24 - 3856.76] your data processing but you got to be
[3855.08 - 3860.28] sharp with a team who's probably half
[3856.76 - 3862.32] your age oh yes team with half your age
[3860.28 - 3864.12] or people who are in my age and having
[3862.32 - 3866.32] different challenges seniors who are
[3864.12 - 3867.76] kind of extremely demanding hours and
[3866.32 - 3870.68] times and stuff like that so I just
[3867.76 - 3872.52] think that I think it's a it's
[3870.68 - 3874.52] controlled in terms of you know how do I
[3872.52 - 3876.56] recover so when I come back I know that
[3874.52 - 3878.36] glutamine and collagen most important
[3876.56 - 3880.48] you know carry it wherever I go like
[3878.36 - 3882.52] even in Bangalore my bag has collagen
[3880.48 - 3884.72] and glutamine with me saying oh you know
[3882.52 - 3887.12] what I had the run I have to have it so
[3884.72 - 3888.92] it it is just these choices that I have
[3887.12 - 3890.96] I have made because I just think that if
[3888.92 - 3893.12] I'm working with experts what is the
[3890.96 - 3895.96] point if I don't follow you you know you
[3893.12 - 3899.52] tell me uh sha you can't eat gluten but
[3895.96 - 3901.88] I say oh you know what I ran 30 km to
[3899.52 - 3905.04] CH you know I live in Delhi right so
[3901.88 - 3907.32] people swear by CH now that now like for
[3905.04 - 3909.04] example holy is coming guia I found
[3907.32 - 3912.52] somebody who makes
[3909.04 - 3915.64] glutenfree baked no way gluten free
[3912.52 - 3917.12] baked date sweeten call I'm calling you
[3915.64 - 3918.96] up you're sending that across you know
[3917.12 - 3920.64] it's like oh my goodness how did that
[3918.96 - 3923.32] happen my life suddenly started looking
[3920.64 - 3925.84] up but I have made those choices if I
[3923.32 - 3927.80] wouldn't get that I'm happy not to eat
[3925.84 - 3930.00] but but the problem is that you know you
[3927.80 - 3931.96] give into your Temptations I think it's
[3930.00 - 3935.56] just simple choices that I made that's
[3931.96 - 3936.92] what has helped me sustain simple you
[3935.56 - 3939.32] know you talked about your work and
[3936.92 - 3940.40] heading a large Global it company's
[3939.32 - 3943.64] marketing
[3940.40 - 3946.56] Division if you had to run your own
[3943.64 - 3950.72] company and you had people working with
[3946.56 - 3952.84] you would you encourage your employees
[3950.72 - 3957.28] to take up physical activity would you
[3952.84 - 3959.64] encourage them to eat healthy so I would
[3957.28 - 3962.64] make Fitness as a part of the whole
[3959.64 - 3965.48] appraisal process saying that you know
[3962.64 - 3967.48] it is a mandate like like if you know uh
[3965.48 - 3969.56] these uh a lot of the shoe brands who
[3967.48 - 3970.80] have Offices here they have this
[3969.56 - 3972.44] practice that you know you have to
[3970.80 - 3974.36] mandatorily be doing one hour of a gym
[3972.44 - 3976.52] and things like that so it would be part
[3974.36 - 3978.12] of their their regime and routine it's
[3976.52 - 3980.68] it would be like a mandatory code of
[3978.12 - 3982.88] conduct if I may say and Ryan Fernando
[3980.68 - 3984.68] would be doing nutrition for everybody
[3982.88 - 3987.20] and very interesting I want to share
[3984.68 - 3989.84] with you actually love to uh kind of
[3987.20 - 3991.76] ensure that you know charity begins at
[3989.84 - 3994.44] home kind so you know you start with
[3991.76 - 3996.44] practicing it with uh everybody on that
[3994.44 - 3999.56] note you would also know that I ensure
[3996.44 - 4004.88] that my mom goes to gym and follows a
[3999.56 - 4006.88] fairly uh decent eating plus supplement
[4004.88 - 4009.12] level like she also takes glutamine and
[4006.88 - 4011.08] collagen and all of that all ctsy you
[4009.12 - 4012.84] she goes to the gym every single day gy
[4011.08 - 4015.72] as she does resistance training of
[4012.84 - 4018.44] course she does like she sends me video
[4015.72 - 4020.68] where she's doing like 80 kg 90 kg leg
[4018.44 - 4023.92] press and stuff like that cool she's
[4020.68 - 4027.68] she's 65 so here's the
[4023.92 - 4030.40] thing if mahash go had to recommend to
[4027.68 - 4034.24] the women of India the modern women of
[4030.40 - 4036.44] India um some advice what would you take
[4034.24 - 4039.88] out from your book of wisdom to
[4036.44 - 4043.32] them watch where you're
[4039.88 - 4045.84] investing most people go to parlor for
[4043.32 - 4047.64] beautification and doing skin care and
[4045.84 - 4050.16] healthare and everything like you said
[4047.64 - 4052.92] and I love when people say that my skin
[4050.16 - 4056.32] looks very nice maybe some of it is
[4052.92 - 4058.04] genetic but I think I am feeling and
[4056.32 - 4060.80] looking the way I am looking because I'm
[4058.04 - 4063.76] taking of my body from inside not from
[4060.80 - 4066.48] outside you know like I I don't get a
[4063.76 - 4069.16] facial or a thing like that done I'm not
[4066.48 - 4071.28] I'm not trying to look up look down upon
[4069.16 - 4073.64] anybody is doing it I'm just making a
[4071.28 - 4075.76] suggestion that maybe balance it out of
[4073.64 - 4077.48] taking care of your body not just
[4075.76 - 4079.68] externally but internally as well
[4077.48 - 4082.84] because internal will reflect
[4079.68 - 4086.84] externally instead of buying a solitaire
[4082.84 - 4089.68] what what 10 lakhs maybe invest in a
[4086.84 - 4091.72] nutritionist and get back into a
[4089.68 - 4094.96] wellness regime which is a combination
[4091.72 - 4097.76] of your Fitness the right kind of food
[4094.96 - 4099.44] uh mental wellness and you will
[4097.76 - 4101.52] automatically start looking the way
[4099.44 - 4103.44] you're looking I I don't remember when I
[4101.52 - 4106.00] last I think two years ago I got a
[4103.44 - 4108.44] facial done because I was going to my
[4106.00 - 4110.84] cousins wedding and and everybody in my
[4108.44 - 4112.44] house is like they're we're bongs right
[4110.84 - 4114.32] so everything is about gold and decking
[4112.44 - 4116.68] up and I'm I'm nowhere there and I said
[4114.32 - 4119.36] okay at least let me play a tiny role so
[4116.68 - 4121.72] I just seeing that Mak smart choices you
[4119.36 - 4123.12] know people who are on a nutrition plan
[4121.72 - 4125.80] specifically when they're doing it with
[4123.12 - 4128.80] me I still remember I was working with
[4125.80 - 4132.96] the leading U tolywood which is our part
[4128.80 - 4134.52] of the world Bollywood actress and uh
[4132.96 - 4136.12] she came to me three months later and
[4134.52 - 4140.80] she says like
[4136.12 - 4140.80] you know what the cameraman asked me
[4145.08 - 4149.76] Madam so she came to me like I haven't
[4147.88 - 4153.00] gone for a facial for 3 months what have
[4149.76 - 4155.08] you done and what most people don't
[4153.00 - 4157.72] realize is that skin is the largest
[4155.08 - 4161.36] organ in the human body you put in the
[4157.72 - 4164.56] right Foods uh you open up the post and
[4161.36 - 4166.20] and for for the viewers out there like
[4164.56 - 4169.20] most of my guests who come in and put
[4166.20 - 4172.28] tons of makeup on this is her glowing
[4169.20 - 4175.52] skin there's no cakes of makeup on her
[4172.28 - 4179.56] so the the process over here is running
[4175.52 - 4181.60] enhances oxygen running enhances the
[4179.56 - 4183.20] damage to the body which is positive in
[4181.60 - 4185.28] terms of the growth hormone that comes
[4183.20 - 4188.76] the next day to reheal your body so you
[4185.28 - 4190.16] become younger and third is the Dal
[4188.76 - 4191.84] chavel rooty that you're eating
[4190.16 - 4195.84] correctly minus the gluten by the way
[4191.84 - 4199.08] gluten is huge in hyperpigmentation
[4195.84 - 4202.64] research has shown that most of your
[4199.08 - 4206.36] rosacea ecmia soris Vitiligo which are
[4202.64 - 4208.40] skin conditions are triggers of eating
[4206.36 - 4210.96] the wrong food where your autoimmune
[4208.40 - 4212.60] system slaps yourself so right now the
[4210.96 - 4214.84] only slapping that is happening inside
[4212.60 - 4217.20] of your body is those two hours of
[4214.84 - 4219.92] workout that you do every day which is a
[4217.20 - 4222.04] positive most people do it from food and
[4219.92 - 4223.92] that food when it slaps the body well
[4222.04 - 4225.32] you get it on the lips to the hips kind
[4223.92 - 4227.56] of thing and the skin starts
[4225.32 - 4230.56] degenerating I I will I will tell you
[4227.56 - 4232.68] something which is really uh funny and
[4230.56 - 4234.88] uh so when I first started with you you
[4232.68 - 4236.56] gave me this collagen I have right super
[4234.88 - 4239.16] expensive or whatever at least then it
[4236.56 - 4240.32] felt like so I used to be like I don't
[4239.16 - 4241.64] know what this thing does I don't know
[4240.32 - 4244.36] why it's giving me all this you know
[4241.64 - 4246.12] it's so expensive like first youa and
[4244.36 - 4249.92] then the supplements are also like this
[4246.12 - 4251.72] and I I used to be like you know like I
[4249.92 - 4254.16] had it but I think I was like do I
[4251.72 - 4256.60] really need this like is it go go and
[4254.16 - 4258.16] today the is always it's in your it's in
[4256.60 - 4260.12] your suitcase back it's in my suitcase
[4258.16 - 4262.68] back and it's like a stock of it in the
[4260.12 - 4264.60] house like you know what if you know
[4262.68 - 4266.28] tomorrow suddenly as if I won't get it
[4264.60 - 4269.00] or something I'm having which comes from
[4266.28 - 4271.20] the moon so it is a mindset change that
[4269.00 - 4273.92] happened not because of anything else
[4271.20 - 4275.84] but but realizing what it is doing to me
[4273.92 - 4278.76] you know I think that realization today
[4275.84 - 4280.40] my mom has like like collagen and all my
[4278.76 - 4282.24] I think all my friends who are not even
[4280.40 - 4284.72] into fitness they have also started
[4282.24 - 4286.40] having collagen looking at my skin like
[4284.72 - 4288.24] their reasons are different but at least
[4286.40 - 4289.96] they started having collagen so I hope
[4288.24 - 4291.68] you're taking supplement dotin collagen
[4289.96 - 4293.80] because that's the collagen I designed
[4291.68 - 4296.24] and I share a secret with you when we
[4293.80 - 4298.28] were designing the product we put in the
[4296.24 - 4301.48] right amount of vitamin C grape seed
[4298.28 - 4304.48] extract and glutathione in very minute
[4301.48 - 4307.60] quantities but the reason why collagen
[4304.48 - 4309.76] is important for you is not the skin
[4307.60 - 4311.52] yeah it's your soft tissue boom boom
[4309.76 - 4315.20] boom pounding the pavement every day
[4311.52 - 4318.12] right so what people don't realize is
[4315.20 - 4320.40] collagen or gelatin these two guys have
[4318.12 - 4323.88] a certain amino acid in it which the
[4320.40 - 4327.28] other food chains uh of protein you do
[4323.88 - 4330.36] not get those two amino acids readily
[4327.28 - 4334.04] available so actually your body doesn't
[4330.36 - 4336.68] absorb collagen you eat collagen your
[4334.04 - 4339.40] stomach acid rips it apart into its
[4336.68 - 4341.84] designated amino acids you absorb those
[4339.40 - 4344.80] amino acids now your body's like hey
[4341.84 - 4346.12] Baha you've given me Proline and hydroxy
[4344.80 - 4348.76] Proline what are we going to do with
[4346.12 - 4350.20] this the Skin's like hey buddy you know
[4348.76 - 4352.08] we need some we need some Proline and
[4350.20 - 4353.84] hydroxy chorine if you got some extra so
[4352.08 - 4355.76] literally I'm like a drug dealer to you
[4353.84 - 4357.52] you know providing you that that
[4355.76 - 4359.56] necessary bump up and then the next
[4357.52 - 4363.16] thing that people ask me is there any
[4359.56 - 4365.20] side effect and I always tell people if
[4363.16 - 4367.40] it's found in the human body so collagen
[4365.20 - 4369.04] is found in the human body so it's like
[4367.40 - 4370.12] saying vitamin C it's found in the human
[4369.04 - 4372.96] body if you take a little bit more
[4370.12 - 4374.20] vitamin C not too much of it so you
[4372.96 - 4376.72] don't need more than 10 grams of
[4374.20 - 4379.28] collagen a day the thing is the Indian
[4376.72 - 4380.48] diet is deficient in collagen yeah and
[4379.28 - 4383.04] all the manufacturers that are
[4380.48 - 4386.20] manufacturing vegetarian collagen they
[4383.04 - 4389.00] actually hoodwinking the public so I
[4386.20 - 4390.88] will uh tell you twoo two stories the
[4389.00 - 4393.24] reason I actually don't mind having
[4390.88 - 4395.44] collagen now is because I realize that
[4393.24 - 4398.76] you know and this is a statement that my
[4395.44 - 4400.92] physio made a few months ago is that I'm
[4398.76 - 4402.84] seeing your body transform as in terms
[4400.92 - 4405.80] of the muscular structure it's like it's
[4402.84 - 4409.08] becoming more like an athlete
[4405.80 - 4411.28] and all I contributed to is one is the
[4409.08 - 4415.24] training running routine and the second
[4411.28 - 4416.88] is you and I'm not saying this because
[4415.24 - 4418.72] you're on a podcast I've been here with
[4416.88 - 4422.20] you for for long enough to know that how
[4418.72 - 4424.36] much I trust you uh so that was the big
[4422.20 - 4426.96] reason why today I know what it is doing
[4424.36 - 4428.48] to my body especially uh when it comes
[4426.96 - 4429.80] to running because for me everything is
[4428.48 - 4431.36] the world is about running right if it's
[4429.80 - 4432.80] good for running if it's good for me
[4431.36 - 4434.56] then I will do it I don't care how
[4432.80 - 4436.44] whatever whatever as long as I have the
[4434.56 - 4438.52] money pocket to if I can afford it I
[4436.44 - 4442.00] will do it I I'm a white colar job
[4438.52 - 4445.20] person I don't have black money so but
[4442.00 - 4446.88] uh I had a friend I have a friend she's
[4445.20 - 4448.88] a runner and she had been having her
[4446.88 - 4450.64] knee trouble for a long time very good
[4448.88 - 4453.08] runner but I think she'd been injured
[4450.64 - 4455.04] for a long time so one day I generally
[4453.08 - 4456.92] run alone but that particular day I
[4455.04 - 4458.64] think was happening and she was like sh
[4456.92 - 4461.44] do you take collagen I said of course I
[4458.64 - 4464.24] do I like two times a day she's like I I
[4461.44 - 4466.32] said you don't so she said no you know
[4464.24 - 4468.52] I'm vegetarian I said collagen is all
[4466.32 - 4471.32] vegetarian she no no it comes from some
[4468.52 - 4473.56] whatever so she's Jen okay she's like
[4471.32 - 4476.52] strict about not having all of this and
[4473.56 - 4479.52] she was like no no I don't think so I
[4476.52 - 4482.24] can have you know types things I tried
[4479.52 - 4483.44] really hard to convince her and uh there
[4482.24 - 4485.20] were others also who were really
[4483.44 - 4486.80] laughing yeah she's a runner she's a
[4485.20 - 4489.36] very good runner but she' been having
[4486.80 - 4491.72] her knee injury for a long time so then
[4489.36 - 4495.92] she started having collagen and she did
[4491.72 - 4498.08] a super strong NDM she's
[4495.92 - 4500.04] a New Delhi Marathon that the full
[4498.08 - 4502.76] distance no the half the half so still
[4500.04 - 4505.08] 21 km of pounding on the joint but but
[4502.76 - 4506.92] she say she started having collagen and
[4505.08 - 4510.08] she says that her her knee starting to
[4506.92 - 4513.84] feel better so I mean for all those of
[4510.08 - 4516.04] you who think that uh the the skin part
[4513.84 - 4518.00] that we were actually making fun of is
[4516.04 - 4520.56] actually a byproduct you know for
[4518.00 - 4523.48] someone like me for whom running is the
[4520.56 - 4525.40] world I think uh it is it is doing so
[4523.48 - 4527.68] much good to not just me that others who
[4525.40 - 4529.00] are kind of trying to adapt ad remember
[4527.68 - 4533.32] when when you first started me it was
[4529.00 - 4535.24] like what about way protein right and U
[4533.32 - 4538.72] don't get me wrong way protein is really
[4535.24 - 4542.84] good but the moment you understand your
[4538.72 - 4545.56] gut symbiosis with a food be it Dairy be
[4542.84 - 4547.56] it gluten be it collagen be it animal
[4545.56 - 4550.48] protein be it vegetarian
[4547.56 - 4553.04] protein the problem is people try to
[4550.48 - 4555.84] make nutrition fashionable yeah it's
[4553.04 - 4557.44] like oh you diet diet run with Solomon
[4555.84 - 4559.44] so I should run with Solomon but maybe
[4557.44 - 4562.04] mine would be ax because my feet
[4559.44 - 4564.00] structure is different so the same
[4562.04 - 4567.16] applies with with nutrition you know
[4564.00 - 4569.84] you're a busy bee you do a lot of work
[4567.16 - 4573.40] you do a lot of running you do I mean
[4569.84 - 4576.32] it's like 140 km a week I don't even
[4573.40 - 4579.32] drive that distance someone ask a
[4576.32 - 4581.20] question what do you do on your off days
[4579.32 - 4584.52] do you ever
[4581.20 - 4586.28] relax so I'll split that into two parts
[4584.52 - 4588.56] on off day so there's off from work and
[4586.28 - 4591.72] there's off from training now off from
[4588.56 - 4594.08] training is a Monday which is not off
[4591.72 - 4596.72] from work so off from training is when I
[4594.08 - 4598.88] actually do the physio maybe do some
[4596.72 - 4600.60] Mobility uh you know spend some time
[4598.88 - 4603.80] doing meditation which I do any which
[4600.60 - 4606.04] way daily and then I just focus on work
[4603.80 - 4608.24] now off from work is when I actually
[4606.04 - 4609.76] chill out because they also my long run
[4608.24 - 4611.96] days which I really really love so I get
[4609.76 - 4613.96] to run longer and then you also give me
[4611.96 - 4615.80] cheat meal in my off days so I do take
[4613.96 - 4618.24] cheat meal and I'm sure you will ask me
[4615.80 - 4620.08] what I eat what's you cheat me for
[4618.24 - 4623.92] everyone out there what what does this
[4620.08 - 4627.36] lady do on a cheat day I I I know you
[4623.92 - 4630.20] love my hometown which is Goa yeah so
[4627.36 - 4634.36] I'm I'm a hardcore nonvegetarian so my
[4630.20 - 4636.52] cheat meal is usually a lot of thie food
[4634.36 - 4639.20] uh because I don't eat gluten but I now
[4636.52 - 4643.20] we have a gluten-free P pizza place in
[4639.20 - 4646.24] Bangalore in sorry in gura so then I do
[4643.20 - 4649.56] pizza but OCC but actually my go-to food
[4646.24 - 4651.20] would be a lot of thigh food because uh
[4649.56 - 4653.20] it's glutenfree and you know all the
[4651.20 - 4656.68] sushi and everything so you like spicy
[4653.20 - 4658.32] food uh not really uh but then thi food
[4656.68 - 4659.88] is because it's my it's my cheat meal
[4658.32 - 4662.08] and it's the only luxury I can have so
[4659.88 - 4664.12] then go for it so and and I'm not like
[4662.08 - 4665.80] too much of an Indian Cuisine like
[4664.12 - 4668.00] butter chicken is not something I would
[4665.80 - 4670.32] go for on a regular cheat meal day I
[4668.00 - 4673.76] might do it one off and as a Bengali on
[4670.32 - 4675.56] your rest days or cheat meal days are
[4673.76 - 4678.08] there any books involved
[4675.56 - 4681.04] so that's what so on my rest days I on
[4678.08 - 4683.28] the weekends I typically I love to read
[4681.04 - 4685.76] so like last weekend was like a really
[4683.28 - 4687.80] high I started a book on Saturday and by
[4685.76 - 4691.44] Monday morning I finished the book so
[4687.80 - 4694.76] that was like an perfect rest day for me
[4691.44 - 4696.36] otherwise I also am a uh movie junkie so
[4694.76 - 4698.36] I love to watch movies and if it's in
[4696.36 - 4700.12] the theater then all the more better but
[4698.36 - 4701.88] then have you ever fallen off asleep in
[4700.12 - 4704.48] a theater because you're so tired from a
[4701.88 - 4707.72] run never I've never fallen off anywhere
[4704.48 - 4711.00] when I'm not wanted to sleep never ever
[4707.72 - 4714.92] uh and uh so I I either watch movies or
[4711.00 - 4716.36] I do Netflix uh I love the suspense
[4714.92 - 4719.08] thriller so I like watching a lot of
[4716.36 - 4720.96] these Thriller Netflix series and I I
[4719.08 - 4722.84] actually like to take the downtime you
[4720.96 - 4725.04] know sometimes I keep my phone off like
[4722.84 - 4726.52] I know I I do I do believe in digital
[4725.04 - 4728.84] downtime which means that I would not
[4726.52 - 4731.96] watch anything anything on the screen no
[4728.84 - 4734.92] phone no Netflix no screen nothing I
[4731.96 - 4737.04] just probably just try and do cooking or
[4734.92 - 4740.00] things that that would relax me which is
[4737.04 - 4741.68] not the usual so I kind of take I really
[4740.00 - 4745.76] focus on saying that how do I want to
[4741.68 - 4749.00] ensure that it gives me the uh hit
[4745.76 - 4750.40] refresh in the true sense of mental and
[4749.00 - 4752.52] then for the physical of course is the
[4750.40 - 4755.08] Monday when I do the physical rest part
[4752.52 - 4756.56] of it and once you recovered and rested
[4755.08 - 4758.28] and had your cheat meal and you come
[4756.56 - 4759.60] back to a training day what is your
[4758.28 - 4762.88] training day look
[4759.60 - 4765.84] like so I wake up around
[4762.88 - 4768.04] 4:15 between 4: to 4 4:30 in the morning
[4765.84 - 4770.92] and then I'm out what's your sleep time
[4768.04 - 4774.32] uh around 10
[4770.92 - 4777.92] 10:30 and uh I you need an alarm clock
[4774.32 - 4780.00] to wake up I do because uh I think I
[4777.92 - 4782.48] just I've just gotten used to it but I
[4780.00 - 4784.24] do tend to wake up around the same time
[4782.48 - 4786.20] even without an alarm but I do keep an
[4784.24 - 4788.72] alarm but I don't use the phone for an
[4786.20 - 4790.76] alarm by the way I use I just don't like
[4788.72 - 4793.36] to keep the phone next to me or the
[4790.76 - 4796.04] digital and I don't check my phone till
[4793.36 - 4797.04] 10 10:30 in the morning usually unless
[4796.04 - 4799.28] if I know that there's something
[4797.04 - 4801.56] pressing at work and I I'm expecting
[4799.28 - 4803.04] cardiovascular surgeon neither am I I
[4801.56 - 4805.60] have the same thing the other day I got
[4803.04 - 4807.12] a client messaging me on the food diary
[4805.60 - 4810.08] and I checked it only at 9:00 in the
[4807.12 - 4812.80] morning when I walked into the clinic
[4810.08 - 4815.92] and uh it was a panic message about the
[4812.80 - 4817.92] scale not moving so I just chuckled
[4815.92 - 4820.08] because you know I'm like you didn't
[4817.92 - 4821.60] have a heart attack but to that person
[4820.08 - 4822.60] is like I stepped at the wiing scale at
[4821.60 - 4824.80] 6:00 a.m. in the morning and you were
[4822.60 - 4827.16] not available till 9:00 you know so I
[4824.80 - 4829.56] think we need to detox a little bit on
[4827.16 - 4831.80] the pressures of you know being
[4829.56 - 4833.92] instantly available and the cortisol
[4831.80 - 4836.60] stress that comes into your thinking and
[4833.92 - 4840.88] body actually contributes to weight gain
[4836.60 - 4843.72] I remember uh you telling me this and uh
[4840.88 - 4846.76] I think it was because of my age and
[4843.72 - 4848.52] whatever my cycle schedules I was having
[4846.76 - 4850.20] some sleep trouble and you told me
[4848.52 - 4852.96] saying do you spend a lot of time on the
[4850.20 - 4854.68] screen and I said well yes that's my job
[4852.96 - 4856.12] uh and then outside of that and I said
[4854.68 - 4858.44] okay I can't I can't take the screen
[4856.12 - 4860.44] away from my job but I definitely can
[4858.44 - 4862.80] take screen away from my rest of the
[4860.44 - 4865.28] time so so I keep the phone outside in
[4862.80 - 4869.24] the study it's charging and then uh you
[4865.28 - 4872.32] know I I put a regular alarm clock uh
[4869.24 - 4873.76] which the old school one kind so I I
[4872.32 - 4875.44] really enjoy very difficult to get
[4873.76 - 4877.08] nowadays I recently went to buy one of
[4875.44 - 4879.04] those old school with the two bells and
[4877.08 - 4881.68] God and I'm searching for it it's not
[4879.04 - 4884.60] very easily available but but speaking
[4881.68 - 4887.16] of alarm clocks you know we need wakeups
[4884.60 - 4889.44] to start our day so you're getting up by
[4887.16 - 4893.84] 4:30 in the morning alarm clock's going
[4889.44 - 4895.76] off what then so I I get up and then I
[4893.84 - 4899.12] I'm a coffee Junkie A little bit that
[4895.76 - 4901.32] you know so first shot of coffee then I
[4899.12 - 4904.60] get ready I step out to run I'm usually
[4901.32 - 4907.20] out to run by 5:30ish depending on what
[4904.60 - 4908.84] my schedule is maybe earlier but never
[4907.20 - 4910.44] later especially because you live in G
[4908.84 - 4914.00] and it's very very hot so you got to
[4910.44 - 4917.44] finish your run early finish my run by
[4914.00 - 4919.44] whatever you usually 7 7:30ish and then
[4917.44 - 4922.04] traditionally customary coffee that
[4919.44 - 4925.12] happens at the cafe in the in the
[4922.04 - 4926.48] neighborhood uh where I come my partner
[4925.12 - 4928.60] joins if the other friends who are
[4926.48 - 4930.00] running it's it's like a open thing
[4928.60 - 4932.32] whoever is there and we have lots of
[4930.00 - 4934.60] friends who regularly come there so even
[4932.32 - 4935.92] if not my my circle of friends come
[4934.60 - 4937.88] there other friends were there so we
[4935.92 - 4940.84] have like our whole banter of whatever
[4937.88 - 4942.68] 40 minutes an hour they come back home
[4940.84 - 4944.84] and sometimes there is gym sometimes
[4942.68 - 4947.36] there is no gym maybe gyms lat later in
[4944.84 - 4951.00] the day uh I kind of set up breakfast
[4947.36 - 4953.04] for my family uh I change get ready do
[4951.00 - 4955.20] my Puja
[4953.04 - 4958.64] meditation uh lay breakfast for the
[4955.20 - 4962.48] family and then I hit walk by 11-ish
[4958.64 - 4965.08] 11:30ish and uh I think 12:31 is
[4962.48 - 4966.72] lunch uh and and through this time I
[4965.08 - 4968.88] just get up I take lunch and then I get
[4966.72 - 4971.36] back to work and then sometimes there
[4968.88 - 4973.60] gym in the evening so then I take that
[4971.36 - 4976.64] break for an hour I go to gym uh I
[4973.60 - 4978.44] mostly work from home uh because my uh
[4976.64 - 4980.44] work timing is mostly UK shift so I
[4978.44 - 4983.08] start around 11 11:30 and I go to late
[4980.44 - 4987.44] night so then I do the jym for an hour
[4983.08 - 4990.16] and I come back I do dinner back to work
[4987.44 - 4991.40] and then I finish work around 9 9:30ish
[4990.16 - 4994.84] then I take some
[4991.40 - 4994.84] downtime with my
[4995.12 - 5000.72] family which is uh like either read a
[4998.52 - 5003.68] book or do something whatever maybe just
[5000.72 - 5005.96] go out for a little drive or uh watch
[5003.68 - 5009.64] something and then go to sleep by 10
[5005.96 - 5012.76] 10:30 that's my typical day uh Monday
[5009.64 - 5014.84] through Friday so that's a typical day
[5012.76 - 5017.44] and that's you going go go go go and
[5014.84 - 5019.44] training during season uh but what is
[5017.44 - 5022.72] your off season like do you completely
[5019.44 - 5024.76] drop off uh in terms of your entire
[5022.72 - 5028.04] schedule now on what does your nutrition
[5024.76 - 5029.48] look like in the offseason days so cuz I
[5028.04 - 5031.32] have a lot of marathon runners and all
[5029.48 - 5032.68] the offseason they just go book just
[5031.32 - 5034.44] just get off the bandwagon they stop
[5032.68 - 5036.56] doing a nutrition plan so what's your
[5034.44 - 5039.32] offseason like honestly I don't believe
[5036.56 - 5039.96] in anything called as offseason you know
[5039.32 - 5043.16] I
[5039.96 - 5045.36] mean I think for an EV every athlete
[5043.16 - 5047.24] who's got to be in the sport it's like
[5045.36 - 5050.08] that that you cannot all you cannot go
[5047.24 - 5051.60] below base and in interestingly today
[5050.08 - 5053.88] morning I was running with somebody I
[5051.60 - 5056.60] met for the first time and that person
[5053.88 - 5061.16] was telling that every time he finishes
[5056.60 - 5063.44] a run he stops running completely and
[5061.16 - 5066.28] then he only starts like 18 weeks before
[5063.44 - 5068.80] the race and I'm like you're at sub
[5066.28 - 5071.08] negative how would you 18 month 18 weeks
[5068.80 - 5074.28] how would you do a marathon again so I
[5071.08 - 5076.96] am always in training as you know uh yes
[5074.28 - 5079.96] the training intensity varies depending
[5076.96 - 5082.76] on how close I am to a race Etc
[5079.96 - 5085.16] according to that my nutrition plan also
[5082.76 - 5088.20] varies saying you know if I'm say in a
[5085.16 - 5090.16] low volume period uh versus a high
[5088.20 - 5092.16] volume period obviously the diet and the
[5090.16 - 5094.92] supplements needed the recovery needed
[5092.16 - 5097.08] and all of that is is varying but it's
[5094.92 - 5098.88] never a state where I don't know what
[5097.08 - 5101.40] offseason is because I don't understand
[5098.88 - 5103.72] that why would you not train because the
[5101.40 - 5105.48] moment you don't train for 4 weeks
[5103.72 - 5106.92] you're going to go back like 6 months in
[5105.48 - 5108.80] your training routine so why would you
[5106.92 - 5110.52] do that you know I get two weeks of
[5108.80 - 5113.04] break after a race and then I start
[5110.52 - 5115.56] training again the intensity gradually
[5113.04 - 5117.88] builds up from there uh you know
[5115.56 - 5120.08] training for the next race that is
[5117.88 - 5122.56] coming up but I don't remember having a
[5120.08 - 5125.20] time when I'm not really training or I'm
[5122.56 - 5128.04] not into nutrition the most important
[5125.20 - 5130.68] mistake I think most people do is that
[5128.04 - 5132.64] when your Peak is low is when you also
[5130.68 - 5134.68] lose focus on nutrition that's when you
[5132.64 - 5137.28] put on weight that's when you lose all
[5134.68 - 5139.88] your strength and then you have to start
[5137.28 - 5141.44] back from scratch and most of the times
[5139.88 - 5143.28] we come back with saying oh you know
[5141.44 - 5146.00] what now I have to lose 5 kgs and then
[5143.28 - 5147.84] get to my training then just imagine how
[5146.00 - 5149.68] how messed up your body and your whole
[5147.84 - 5152.04] system and your routine isn't the poor
[5149.68 - 5154.96] running coach does he focus on getting
[5152.04 - 5157.48] you back to base or for building your
[5154.96 - 5159.92] base so I think my base is always there
[5157.48 - 5162.12] be come nutrition bead I am I am just
[5159.92 - 5164.40] you know how paranoid I am if my weight
[5162.12 - 5168.92] goes up like for me it's like hell break
[5164.40 - 5173.24] so I'm I don't think I ever let
[5168.92 - 5175.40] go I might take smaller breaks like say
[5173.24 - 5177.76] I usually don't drink whenever I'm
[5175.40 - 5180.64] training but if if I'm not at say a
[5177.76 - 5182.72] close to a race day I might have a drink
[5180.64 - 5185.32] I think that's the only variability I
[5182.72 - 5187.24] would do outside of that it is I would
[5185.32 - 5190.04] like to say that this is my way of life
[5187.24 - 5193.44] it's not something that I am doing for a
[5190.04 - 5195.44] particular cause if tomorrow I am
[5193.44 - 5197.00] wherever and whatever I'm doing I don't
[5195.44 - 5199.04] think nutrition is going to go away from
[5197.00 - 5200.84] it because it's it's my way of life it's
[5199.04 - 5203.12] very simple for me you tell me what to
[5200.84 - 5204.72] eat what supplement to have how much to
[5203.12 - 5207.04] eat why do I need to break my head over
[5204.72 - 5209.32] it like you know I was telling I wish my
[5207.04 - 5211.52] cook knew or my help new to read your
[5209.32 - 5214.72] chart give it to him
[5211.52 - 5216.64] saying it's like so much easier so I I
[5214.72 - 5219.48] just think it is it is the biggest
[5216.64 - 5222.20] respite I have in my life you said that
[5219.48 - 5223.92] you know you were never an athlete and
[5222.20 - 5226.72] now you've conquered one of the most
[5223.92 - 5229.72] grueling races in the world I get so
[5226.72 - 5232.68] many people coming in for transformation
[5229.72 - 5236.60] diet plan diet
[5232.68 - 5240.20] diet and then when I see you doing the
[5236.60 - 5242.80] regimented nutrition which is
[5240.20 - 5244.40] scientific how does this mindset and
[5242.80 - 5247.04] motivation I mean because you didn't
[5244.40 - 5248.64] have it in school or college am I right
[5247.04 - 5252.52] and now suddenly this is mindset and
[5248.64 - 5255.96] motivation to make it a way of your life
[5252.52 - 5258.84] so first of all what do you say to
[5255.96 - 5260.84] yourself in your head and um how do you
[5258.84 - 5263.36] keep yourself
[5260.84 - 5265.00] going is there a Nasha of Victory or
[5263.36 - 5267.68] something that happens with you and
[5265.00 - 5269.84] that's why you're always there you're
[5267.68 - 5272.80] turning up every morning I don't think
[5269.84 - 5276.96] I'm driven by Victory I'm driven by the
[5272.80 - 5279.60] process I love the fact of where I was
[5276.96 - 5283.24] to where I've come and that didn't come
[5279.60 - 5285.24] in one day it's a 20e story like if you
[5283.24 - 5287.56] I don't know if you've seen my 78 kg
[5285.24 - 5290.52] picture if I I did I remember if you if
[5287.56 - 5291.64] anybody sees that and this I know most
[5290.52 - 5294.56] people who see it for the first time
[5291.64 - 5299.40] saying this is a lie I said why will I
[5294.56 - 5301.40] lie I mean you know this is me so I have
[5299.40 - 5303.92] I have seen that trans
[5301.40 - 5305.48] transformation the the point that people
[5303.92 - 5307.80] make miss out about transformation it
[5305.48 - 5310.04] doesn't happen in a day it has taken me
[5307.80 - 5312.24] two decades it has taken me a Ryan
[5310.04 - 5314.20] Fernando it has taken my running trainer
[5312.24 - 5317.56] it is taken my physiotherapist taken
[5314.20 - 5321.20] this whole team to be where I am and it
[5317.56 - 5323.68] will not sustain if I leave any of this
[5321.20 - 5325.28] so in like in digital transformation in
[5323.68 - 5327.36] because I'm working in tech people say
[5325.28 - 5329.72] right that it is not a it is not like
[5327.36 - 5331.76] you shift change one gear and it is all
[5329.72 - 5335.68] done it is a holistic development that
[5331.76 - 5338.16] you have to do now I think I think that
[5335.68 - 5341.40] transformation that I have seen is my
[5338.16 - 5343.48] motivation and now that I am here I know
[5341.40 - 5346.00] that if I leave it it's going to go back
[5343.48 - 5347.56] because it's like elastic the moment you
[5346.00 - 5349.80] leave the tension it's going to go
[5347.56 - 5352.80] recoil to where I was it will it will
[5349.80 - 5355.92] take me what 6 months on the tops to go
[5352.80 - 5358.08] back to that 78 kgs at Max you know how
[5355.92 - 5359.64] my body functions right I mean I'm sure
[5358.08 - 5362.72] you'll agree how easy is that going to
[5359.64 - 5365.32] be now I think one way is to look at
[5362.72 - 5369.32] that the second thing is is that the way
[5365.32 - 5371.52] I feel the way I am and the Wellness in
[5369.32 - 5374.36] me which is not just my physical but
[5371.52 - 5376.84] mental also comes from this process I
[5374.36 - 5379.32] think knowing you know it's like that
[5376.84 - 5381.32] that once you have tasted these things
[5379.32 - 5384.32] you would do everything to keep it and I
[5381.32 - 5386.56] think that's what I do in terms of
[5384.32 - 5391.16] motivation I think I
[5386.56 - 5394.08] seek daily wins you know like when you
[5391.16 - 5396.28] when you when like you said the 140k
[5394.08 - 5399.20] week for me that was a win I said oh you
[5396.28 - 5401.76] know what if I'm able to do this 146k
[5399.20 - 5403.40] week well I'm going to treat myself to
[5401.76 - 5405.08] Hot Chocolate now I have whatever hot
[5403.40 - 5406.56] chocolate at my home but I said no I'm
[5405.08 - 5408.04] going to go to this place and have that
[5406.56 - 5410.00] hot chocolate it's like nice and thick
[5408.04 - 5413.40] and sugary and I said you know because I
[5410.00 - 5415.36] earn that so I always keep this whole
[5413.40 - 5417.52] reward and recognition mechanism for
[5415.36 - 5419.60] myself nobody's going to give me I don't
[5417.52 - 5423.36] want it from outside I want to do it for
[5419.60 - 5426.44] myself saying you know 146 if I feel
[5423.36 - 5429.20] that I have done satisfactory well to my
[5426.44 - 5431.12] satisfaction of Performing this 146k
[5429.20 - 5433.24] week I'm going to go treat myself to
[5431.12 - 5435.12] this I think that's a way of motivation
[5433.24 - 5437.20] now I I first said you know what I will
[5435.12 - 5439.16] have Aman croso or then I said no no
[5437.20 - 5440.76] I'll have a tusu I eventually because I
[5439.16 - 5442.60] wouldn't have any of that it's gluten
[5440.76 - 5444.32] and whatever I eventually said you know
[5442.60 - 5446.88] what hot chocolate because it's good for
[5444.32 - 5449.16] recovery so you know I have tweak those
[5446.88 - 5452.00] likings in my life and that's what keeps
[5449.16 - 5454.76] me motivated to keep going I think
[5452.00 - 5456.72] people look at it from a very long
[5454.76 - 5459.72] perspective and therefore they lose
[5456.72 - 5461.28] traction and they do not break it into I
[5459.72 - 5464.04] I always say this have the smart goal
[5461.28 - 5466.84] concept make it measurable have have
[5464.04 - 5468.32] smaller goals short-term goals win those
[5466.84 - 5469.76] move to the midterm goals therefore you
[5468.32 - 5471.20] will reach to the long-term goal it
[5469.76 - 5473.24] cannot happen in one day it cannot
[5471.20 - 5475.52] happen in one week it's it's an ongoing
[5473.24 - 5476.84] ongoing process as I say it's a way of
[5475.52 - 5479.16] life I think that's the only way to stay
[5476.84 - 5480.80] motivated a lot of women are going to be
[5479.16 - 5483.12] inspired about this reward and
[5480.80 - 5484.80] recognition and how you've started and
[5483.12 - 5486.76] how you don't need an external
[5484.80 - 5489.00] affirmation to yourself but it's your
[5486.76 - 5491.76] own goals and then you meet it and you
[5489.00 - 5494.48] get there um and so I think a lot of
[5491.76 - 5495.72] women are now watching us and getting
[5494.48 - 5498.52] very
[5495.72 - 5503.36] enamored we've done hundreds of blood
[5498.52 - 5506.32] tests over the last few years right and
[5503.36 - 5508.96] I've taken a lot of blood out of you and
[5506.32 - 5511.24] throw some insight on how important do
[5508.96 - 5514.16] you think is the blood test being able
[5511.24 - 5517.04] to change your behavior your diet plan
[5514.16 - 5518.92] your training regime uh and should the
[5517.04 - 5522.08] endurance at see you've been on the side
[5518.92 - 5524.28] of the fence as a marathon runner minus
[5522.08 - 5526.00] professional sports nutrition and now
[5524.28 - 5528.44] you're on the side of the fence with a
[5526.00 - 5531.56] professional sports nutritionist how do
[5528.44 - 5534.60] you think the blood test have helped you
[5531.56 - 5535.92] from being an endurance athlete I'll
[5534.60 - 5537.68] give you the first example I don't know
[5535.92 - 5539.36] if you'd remember when I first came in
[5537.68 - 5542.88] my cholesterol used to be
[5539.36 - 5544.56] high uh not not because I mean there
[5542.88 - 5546.92] were there were multiple fact I think
[5544.56 - 5549.44] because I didn't know a lot of the
[5546.92 - 5552.40] nutrition uh knowledge that I have today
[5549.44 - 5553.36] working with you plus some amount of uh
[5552.40 - 5556.48] family
[5553.36 - 5558.84] history uh I have a family history of
[5556.48 - 5560.92] everybody having heart disease and all
[5558.84 - 5563.32] kinds of stuff so I think today my
[5560.92 - 5564.96] cholesterol is pretty much normal I
[5563.32 - 5567.12] don't take any medication so that's a
[5564.96 - 5569.00] first indication now why I'm telling you
[5567.12 - 5571.04] this is a comfort that when I see a
[5569.00 - 5573.48] whole family with heart disease
[5571.04 - 5575.56] cholesterol shooting up sugar going out
[5573.48 - 5578.36] of the away my my mom said everybody's
[5575.56 - 5580.64] diabetic you know I lost my granny to
[5578.36 - 5584.08] you know losing kidney failure and
[5580.64 - 5586.40] passed away and things like that I think
[5584.08 - 5589.88] what has helped me is to the confidence
[5586.40 - 5592.68] that you know my body is I am not
[5589.88 - 5595.44] inviting these diseases into me it's a
[5592.68 - 5597.16] it's a way of control it is a it is a
[5595.44 - 5599.56] report that whatever I'm doing it's like
[5597.16 - 5601.08] a result report card you know I do six
[5599.56 - 5603.04] months of studying it's like it's like
[5601.08 - 5605.08] the semester scheme I had in engineering
[5603.04 - 5606.68] 6 months you study you get a report card
[5605.08 - 5608.00] you give your exam which is the blood
[5606.68 - 5610.88] test you get a report card you say you
[5608.00 - 5613.20] know what all good okay okay A A A okay
[5610.88 - 5615.00] this one B Ryan this is B what do we do
[5613.20 - 5617.28] about it then we go into a fixing mode
[5615.00 - 5619.44] saying okay maybe let's let's get into
[5617.28 - 5621.56] you know uh fixing this or or whatever
[5619.44 - 5622.96] reason it is high I think over the four
[5621.56 - 5625.52] years we've reached a stage where
[5622.96 - 5627.48] everything from B has also become a so
[5625.52 - 5629.12] today when we look at the blood test I
[5627.48 - 5631.52] don't think for the longest time we have
[5629.12 - 5635.08] needed to do any corrections we've kind
[5631.52 - 5636.92] of said yeah all's good you know now all
[5635.08 - 5638.76] is good can we make it better I think
[5636.92 - 5641.60] that has been the focus which is a big
[5638.76 - 5643.20] shift from here saying this is high so
[5641.60 - 5645.08] we need to correct and make sure that
[5643.20 - 5647.32] your cholesterol is low to today saying
[5645.08 - 5649.60] that you know what can we improve your
[5647.32 - 5651.76] hemoglobin further SE for it will enable
[5649.60 - 5653.96] you to better run so I think this whole
[5651.76 - 5656.36] blood test Journey that we have done of
[5653.96 - 5659.00] hundreds of blood tests from being
[5656.36 - 5661.24] correcting to health perspective to
[5659.00 - 5663.16] Performance has has been the journey
[5661.24 - 5664.44] that I think we have had to put it very
[5663.16 - 5668.24] very simply
[5664.44 - 5670.52] So speaking of the health corrective
[5668.24 - 5672.64] process of the blood test and then the
[5670.52 - 5676.64] performance the performance part of the
[5672.64 - 5678.64] blood test right so obviously you are I
[5676.64 - 5680.40] could give you an honorarium Sports
[5678.64 - 5681.72] Nutrition degree right now with the
[5680.40 - 5684.04] amount of work that we have done
[5681.72 - 5686.80] together so from the supplement point of
[5684.04 - 5689.36] view uh what are your health supplements
[5686.80 - 5692.32] and what are your performance
[5689.36 - 5694.40] supplements I think from a supplement
[5692.32 - 5696.64] per se
[5694.40 - 5698.76] gone are those days when we had we
[5696.64 - 5700.24] started with health supplements I think
[5698.76 - 5702.40] you know where we said okay we need to
[5700.24 - 5704.56] take your cholesterol under control we
[5702.40 - 5706.52] need to take care of your this and that
[5704.56 - 5709.48] today everything that we are working on
[5706.52 - 5712.04] is mostly to say how do we ensure that
[5709.48 - 5714.72] uh you know your your performance is
[5712.04 - 5717.60] enhancing and your recovery is being
[5714.72 - 5719.76] taken care and also considering my age
[5717.60 - 5721.96] how am I able to sustain this did you
[5719.76 - 5724.52] ever have this thought process that oh
[5721.96 - 5726.28] my God you know Ryan's given me these 22
[5724.52 - 5728.24] supplements I remember there was one
[5726.28 - 5730.24] race that we went for there was nearly
[5728.24 - 5732.20] 22 supplements now people might get
[5730.24 - 5734.12] shocked out there but was there that
[5732.20 - 5736.68] thought in your head like oh my God I'm
[5734.12 - 5738.20] taking so many powder spills and gels
[5736.68 - 5742.00] versus to what is your thought process
[5738.20 - 5743.68] today I when I first time when I first
[5742.00 - 5746.52] started I think the first very month
[5743.68 - 5748.92] when I saw it and I was kind of like uh
[5746.52 - 5750.44] I looked at it and I was like okay and
[5748.92 - 5752.64] my question was that how long will this
[5750.44 - 5756.88] be sustainable you know honestly if I
[5752.64 - 5761.28] say but today uh the way it has helped
[5756.88 - 5764.48] me to fill in the what my food cannot
[5761.28 - 5766.72] give me probably or my body's ability to
[5764.48 - 5769.16] absorb that food I know what that
[5766.72 - 5771.32] supplement how it is benefiting me so I
[5769.16 - 5773.36] don't think I ever think today I think I
[5771.32 - 5775.52] cannot do the other way around you know
[5773.36 - 5777.48] if I have to sustain what I'm doing I
[5775.52 - 5778.88] can go back to 78 kgs I don't need to do
[5777.48 - 5780.80] any of this stuff I'm going to save this
[5778.88 - 5782.08] money and buy the Louis Vuitton and I'm
[5780.80 - 5785.00] definitely not going to come back to
[5782.08 - 5786.84] this chair again but I think for for me
[5785.00 - 5789.20] to sustain and if I want to continue
[5786.84 - 5792.20] doing it with my age coming up being a
[5789.20 - 5794.52] woman with my cycle fluctuations and all
[5792.20 - 5797.20] of that I think it is just only only
[5794.52 - 5799.12] only enhancing me working towards my
[5797.20 - 5802.08] performance helping me to deal with you
[5799.12 - 5804.92] know the whole menopause thing the the
[5802.08 - 5807.12] most whatever dreaded m word in the
[5804.92 - 5810.76] women's world I think I'm able to
[5807.12 - 5813.32] sustain I only have fewer moments of
[5810.76 - 5815.76] those darkness in the whole menopause
[5813.32 - 5817.64] cycle versus probably a lot of people
[5815.76 - 5819.36] and I would give it to you for all that
[5817.64 - 5821.68] all that we are putting into together so
[5819.36 - 5823.44] I think there's no straight answer to
[5821.68 - 5825.76] what supplement I think is a whole
[5823.44 - 5828.52] combination that comes in it's not about
[5825.76 - 5830.52] one one multivitamin or one Omega or one
[5828.52 - 5832.68] D3 like most people do but it's a
[5830.52 - 5834.40] combination of all these aspects
[5832.68 - 5837.04] together saying what I need for my
[5834.40 - 5839.24] performance what I need to recover what
[5837.04 - 5840.48] I need to deal with my menopause I think
[5839.24 - 5842.56] those some of those things that you give
[5840.48 - 5844.08] me are horrendous to have but I I still
[5842.56 - 5847.08] remember I'll never never forget that
[5844.08 - 5848.68] zinzino oil I was like oh my God who has
[5847.08 - 5850.68] it I'm like every time I have it I'm
[5848.68 - 5852.48] like Ryan what are you making me have
[5850.68 - 5854.60] like you know and for those who are
[5852.48 - 5857.08] hearing this name this is uh this is one
[5854.60 - 5859.68] of the most uh highly recognized
[5857.08 - 5862.68] Omega-3s which come in from Iceland so
[5859.68 - 5865.48] the arctic cold fish uh combined with
[5862.68 - 5867.56] olive oil and shows that your omega-3
[5865.48 - 5870.20] doesn't Den nature and these guys don't
[5867.56 - 5873.88] put into capsule because you need to uh
[5870.20 - 5877.08] Bond it to olive oil and um you you
[5873.88 - 5880.04] can't take like 500 mg in a capsule it's
[5877.08 - 5883.08] not enough so we need like uh 20
[5880.04 - 5886.92] capsules that's 10 GS of the oil in a
[5883.08 - 5888.52] day and um so I always tell athletes you
[5886.92 - 5892.04] have no taste buds you know at the end
[5888.52 - 5893.88] of the day I I always say this to people
[5892.04 - 5896.64] a lot of people like I I remember i'
[5893.88 - 5900.00] gone home recently and uh somebody asked
[5896.64 - 5902.60] me so uh what do you eat for dinner and
[5900.00 - 5904.20] I said usually chicken and some kind of
[5902.60 - 5907.24] like you know
[5904.20 - 5909.04] salad and whatever so my dad was sitting
[5907.24 - 5911.68] next to me and he said you can't eat
[5909.04 - 5913.24] what she eats you know she he just
[5911.68 - 5916.20] clearly made his blatant statement you
[5913.24 - 5919.28] can't eat what she eats and I said well
[5916.20 - 5922.56] it's tasty my my dad said well for you
[5919.28 - 5926.52] so the point is that I think the
[5922.56 - 5928.28] definition of taste is it's an acquired
[5926.52 - 5931.16] taste you
[5928.28 - 5934.20] know I am the same person who loved this
[5931.16 - 5936.92] plush chicken curry and today I just
[5934.20 - 5939.88] love my boiled chicken with some basic
[5936.92 - 5942.60] spices into it literally boiled or air
[5939.88 - 5946.76] fried in my new found love but it's just
[5942.60 - 5949.72] that I today as compared to that
[5946.76 - 5952.36] whatever taste I know that this is good
[5949.72 - 5955.44] for me I feel good eating it and I think
[5952.36 - 5958.00] that feel good is far more Superior to
[5955.44 - 5960.72] whatever taste like I have my cheat meal
[5958.00 - 5962.76] to to taste whatever I want to taste but
[5960.72 - 5964.76] it is only that moment anything else for
[5962.76 - 5966.28] most of the time if it's not good for me
[5964.76 - 5967.84] I like saying yeah you know what Ryan's
[5966.28 - 5969.92] going to die thinking this and I can't
[5967.84 - 5973.44] have Ryan dying so don't have this
[5969.92 - 5975.48] simple so I think sometimes I do think I
[5973.44 - 5977.68] will say this sometimes I do think oh
[5975.48 - 5979.68] you know what I really loved eating this
[5977.68 - 5981.88] now I discovered that this this whole
[5979.68 - 5985.68] concept of loved eating it now in your
[5981.88 - 5987.88] mind youve preset what do you call uh
[5985.68 - 5990.80] emotions or triggers of saying that oh
[5987.88 - 5993.80] yeah I liked having say PKA on panipuri
[5990.80 - 5996.32] on the road that is what I liked but
[5993.80 - 5999.32] today when I eat it do I enjoy it as
[5996.32 - 6001.20] much no I don't now the moment I realize
[5999.32 - 6004.84] that then I realize that you know my
[6001.20 - 6007.72] liking is of the past of what I didn't
[6004.84 - 6009.40] care after that I had I felt acidity or
[6007.72 - 6011.16] I felt uncomfortable or that I didn't
[6009.40 - 6014.00] have any awareness
[6011.16 - 6016.76] oh oh you know what all girls having by
[6014.00 - 6019.60] the roadside very happy uh but today I
[6016.76 - 6021.32] don't feel like that so that that change
[6019.60 - 6023.40] has happened over the years and today
[6021.32 - 6026.92] it's it's all about what is good for me
[6023.40 - 6028.92] and I mean I I think I love the state of
[6026.92 - 6030.96] being that I am so you know you talk
[6028.92 - 6032.40] about the supplement and then you know
[6030.96 - 6035.24] you hate something and then there's a
[6032.40 - 6038.08] routine and then you begin to love it
[6035.24 - 6041.24] the routine part I think is what helps
[6038.08 - 6043.84] everyone get to a new sense of
[6041.24 - 6045.96] realization and speaking of
[6043.84 - 6049.60] routines we didn't talk about your
[6045.96 - 6053.00] Marathon running routines so how does
[6049.60 - 6055.40] that work for the uninitiated outside
[6053.00 - 6058.32] who maybe somebody's like very inspired
[6055.40 - 6061.00] by you having at one point in your life
[6058.32 - 6063.80] being 70 plus kgs and now you're one of
[6061.00 - 6065.80] the fittest woman I know your skin is
[6063.80 - 6068.44] glowing um you know you're very
[6065.80 - 6069.88] disciplined and even boiled chicken
[6068.44 - 6071.24] seems to appeal to you and your father
[6069.88 - 6074.32] says though you can't eat what she's
[6071.24 - 6076.40] eating this is a new afar this a new you
[6074.32 - 6078.88] many women out there many athletes out
[6076.40 - 6083.28] there would be inspired by this where do
[6078.88 - 6085.48] they start 5K 10K 15K 25k the full
[6083.28 - 6087.72] Marathon ultra marathon what is your
[6085.48 - 6088.60] training regime how is it evolved over
[6087.72 - 6092.24] the
[6088.60 - 6094.48] years I think the first key is to start
[6092.24 - 6097.40] you know you don't need to find a
[6094.48 - 6099.72] perfect solution to your problem the Sol
[6097.40 - 6102.92] the problem is that you know we we kind
[6099.72 - 6108.24] of want to find the perfect routine on
[6102.92 - 6110.08] day one and be be me in end of 30 days I
[6108.24 - 6112.28] think the message that I would like to
[6110.08 - 6113.76] have everybody have is that you know
[6112.28 - 6116.72] start small
[6113.76 - 6121.00] start with realistic goals for yourself
[6116.72 - 6122.92] I didn't set out to become 78 to being
[6121.00 - 6126.08] this person I didn't know I didn't have
[6122.92 - 6128.00] a vision of this nobody I we didn't have
[6126.08 - 6130.32] internet at that time to know I didn't
[6128.00 - 6132.44] have Ryan Fernando I didn't know MDS I
[6130.32 - 6135.28] didn't even know Marathon like you know
[6132.44 - 6138.96] was out of question I mean I in in my
[6135.28 - 6142.68] time in 2000 the first gym I went to was
[6138.96 - 6144.84] a little Cordon of place in a men's gym
[6142.68 - 6148.64] and we had a separate entry to that
[6144.84 - 6150.64] place because women were not welcomed in
[6148.64 - 6153.24] the gym at that time that's the era that
[6150.64 - 6155.60] I have begin this journey on now today
[6153.24 - 6158.28] we have access to everything I mean
[6155.60 - 6160.36] there is there every possible Fitness
[6158.28 - 6162.12] tool that one can think of as available
[6160.36 - 6163.80] so I think the first step is to just
[6162.12 - 6165.52] start small and have a realistic goal
[6163.80 - 6168.60] for oneself that you know why do you
[6165.52 - 6171.08] want to start it the second thing is
[6168.60 - 6173.80] discipline resilience and patience I
[6171.08 - 6175.80] think most of us lack there
[6173.80 - 6177.84] you want to do five days and you feel so
[6175.80 - 6180.88] great that you go and Hell break on day
[6177.84 - 6183.76] six you know and then day seven never
[6180.88 - 6186.20] comes after that you got to be at it
[6183.76 - 6188.00] like you know I've not been keeping well
[6186.20 - 6190.44] yesterday I came down and I was down
[6188.00 - 6193.28] with the cold today morning I got up and
[6190.44 - 6197.36] I wasn't feeling my best but my training
[6193.28 - 6199.76] routine said I had to do the 22k what I
[6197.36 - 6202.56] absolutely dislike to do is to tell
[6199.76 - 6204.96] Jason okay yesterday was a bad day I
[6202.56 - 6208.04] couldn't do it I rest in I'm not saying
[6204.96 - 6210.16] that you know you go but today between
[6208.04 - 6212.80] sleeping and going to run I knew that if
[6210.16 - 6214.88] I run I will feel so much better as
[6212.80 - 6217.32] against trying to just be lazy it's not
[6214.88 - 6219.72] that I was like anything major happened
[6217.32 - 6221.76] that I couldn't run so I think if I if
[6219.72 - 6224.28] you bring that discipline into your
[6221.76 - 6226.36] program in whatever you are
[6224.28 - 6227.92] doing with that a little bit of
[6226.36 - 6229.68] resilience because there are going to be
[6227.92 - 6231.60] bad days you know especially women have
[6229.68 - 6233.92] a lot of bad days you know during your
[6231.60 - 6235.84] Cycles you're like going nothing over it
[6233.92 - 6238.24] you know and a lot of people have their
[6235.84 - 6241.20] painful Cycles like you know I get
[6238.24 - 6244.04] bloating like hell but the point is that
[6241.20 - 6247.52] even then all you got to do is to show
[6244.04 - 6249.56] up for yourself the moment you do that
[6247.52 - 6251.76] then over a period it becomes then it
[6249.56 - 6253.12] the first time is the toughest the
[6251.76 - 6254.84] second time you already have the
[6253.12 - 6257.40] experience then you third time becomes
[6254.84 - 6259.68] easier fourth time becomes easier and I
[6257.40 - 6262.00] think it is just those those three four
[6259.68 - 6263.56] things that we need to kind of keep at
[6262.00 - 6265.16] it most of us fail out because we don't
[6263.56 - 6267.72] have discipline like you remember in the
[6265.16 - 6269.20] whole concept of timetable when we were
[6267.72 - 6271.36] kids saying you know we had a home
[6269.20 - 6274.36] timetable during holidays
[6271.36 - 6276.04] saying TV time sport time everything so
[6274.36 - 6279.08] I think we got to just have it there I
[6276.04 - 6282.12] have a I have a check mark uh calendar
[6279.08 - 6284.36] for myself for the year I started doing
[6282.12 - 6286.40] this last year and I did a Blog also
[6284.36 - 6289.72] about uh saying that how I scored over
[6286.40 - 6291.48] the year and I put a is this blog open
[6289.72 - 6293.76] to the public yeah yeah it is open to it
[6291.48 - 6296.44] is it's called My Boran and is open to
[6293.76 - 6299.28] public to people my borin I don't write
[6296.44 - 6301.04] as frequently as I would love to but but
[6299.28 - 6303.32] it expresses who you are yeah it
[6301.04 - 6305.24] expresses war I've written some of these
[6303.32 - 6308.00] things so so this one was about my
[6305.24 - 6310.40] scorecard you know and and it was simple
[6308.00 - 6313.56] about I it it has two simple tricks
[6310.40 - 6316.48] there a green tick and a red cross the
[6313.56 - 6318.24] green tick means that everything went
[6316.48 - 6321.40] well like physical wellness mental
[6318.24 - 6323.60] wellness and I felt okay and I'm not
[6321.40 - 6325.48] saying great because okay is good itself
[6323.60 - 6328.08] I mean you know why do you why is okay
[6325.48 - 6330.08] not good you know that means why is okay
[6328.08 - 6332.40] not good I think that's a nice statement
[6330.08 - 6333.80] yeah because lot of people think that oh
[6332.40 - 6337.84] you know
[6333.80 - 6339.88] what things are things are okay well
[6337.84 - 6341.68] things are okay you know it could be so
[6339.88 - 6344.36] much worse you know you could have had
[6341.68 - 6346.76] one leg gone your car would burnt out or
[6344.36 - 6348.60] you thrown out of your job your parents
[6346.76 - 6351.20] are healthy glass is always half full
[6348.60 - 6354.16] correct for me okay is great you know
[6351.20 - 6357.20] the days I feel okay is green tick the
[6354.16 - 6359.56] days I feel miserable is a red tick now
[6357.20 - 6362.60] miserable can be that I had a bad run
[6359.56 - 6365.28] that is that I couldn't do uh I I didn't
[6362.60 - 6366.84] I had a bad meditation or I felt too
[6365.28 - 6369.72] stressed about something in Life or
[6366.84 - 6371.84] whatever is a Red Cross and I diligently
[6369.72 - 6374.16] follow it I do it every day before I go
[6371.84 - 6376.36] to sleep I go it's put on the wall I go
[6374.16 - 6379.36] put that take now what it does is to
[6376.36 - 6381.72] actually monitor myself like oh already
[6379.36 - 6383.96] seven crosses this month I need to Buck
[6381.72 - 6385.64] up you know I need to just focus on why
[6383.96 - 6387.68] are things happening helps me to keep
[6385.64 - 6389.80] correcting myself so I just think that
[6387.68 - 6394.20] people need to people need to just focus
[6389.80 - 6397.12] on some of those uh planned strategic
[6394.20 - 6398.72] moves of taking care of your own life
[6397.12 - 6400.76] you know I recently on a session said
[6398.72 - 6403.84] that are you an entrepreneur of your
[6400.76 - 6406.84] life or of your career most people
[6403.84 - 6409.08] aren't you know we just live by accident
[6406.84 - 6410.08] that like today I had an option I could
[6409.08 - 6412.28] have said oh you know what I have to go
[6410.08 - 6414.76] to Ryan's podcast and all that I'm not
[6412.28 - 6416.60] feeling well let we just sleep the let's
[6414.76 - 6418.52] cancel the run I mean okay I will tell
[6416.60 - 6420.12] let will be an x on your calendar which
[6418.52 - 6423.48] now you're fighting to not put on your
[6420.12 - 6426.68] calendar tonight correct correct so so
[6423.48 - 6428.64] so I think I I I would love to say that
[6426.68 - 6431.40] I I I have a job but I'm an entrepreneur
[6428.64 - 6433.84] of my life I I decide and I want to
[6431.40 - 6435.88] ensure that my life is profitable so I I
[6433.84 - 6437.68] am really really conscious about what
[6435.88 - 6440.52] investment I'm doing that is so powerful
[6437.68 - 6444.52] sha because you know as a health coach
[6440.52 - 6445.88] that's so powerful I see people and you
[6444.52 - 6448.16] see the film stars you see the
[6445.88 - 6451.68] celebrities you see what I call you as
[6448.16 - 6454.36] an elite athlete hitting your goals you
[6451.68 - 6458.04] have that resilience you have that drive
[6454.36 - 6460.56] and most people after they leave
[6458.04 - 6462.76] College they're not accountable anymore
[6460.56 - 6465.16] because that report card is not there
[6462.76 - 6467.68] that tick mark Or that X is not
[6465.16 - 6471.04] voluntary being submitted and you know
[6467.68 - 6473.76] the only um exam that you technically
[6471.04 - 6476.24] answer is your annual oper raisal
[6473.76 - 6478.00] because you want to get a better scor
[6476.24 - 6480.00] card right and when a lot of people
[6478.00 - 6482.12] don't get that scor card they're very
[6480.00 - 6485.00] unhappy that you know it was their
[6482.12 - 6486.72] god-given uh entitlement entitlement
[6485.00 - 6489.16] that they should get it but in the
[6486.72 - 6490.84] basics of their life forget the job
[6489.16 - 6493.00] they're not keeping a checklist they're
[6490.84 - 6495.60] not keeping the tick mark on the
[6493.00 - 6498.20] X and uh that's what I tell a lot of
[6495.60 - 6499.96] people when was the last time you held
[6498.20 - 6501.92] yourself accountable because it was your
[6499.96 - 6504.92] school teacher or principal that held
[6501.92 - 6507.24] you accountable and I think in most um
[6504.92 - 6509.64] relationships I think sometimes if one
[6507.24 - 6511.84] of the spouse or both of the spouses
[6509.64 - 6514.04] have this tick mark they hold each other
[6511.84 - 6516.60] accountable to a certain extent but I
[6514.04 - 6518.56] think your body is your true life
[6516.60 - 6522.28] partner and therefore you need to hold
[6518.56 - 6525.24] it accountable absolutely it it's like
[6522.28 - 6525.24] you know most people
[6526.24 - 6531.60] say you know I'm not
[6529.12 - 6533.64] saying can be I mean I'm I'm a human
[6531.60 - 6536.40] being I can I can have an heart attack
[6533.64 - 6539.64] or I can have organ whatever can happen
[6536.40 - 6540.60] I don't know but I at least know that I
[6539.64 - 6544.20] am
[6540.60 - 6547.36] trying very hard in a planned action
[6544.20 - 6551.48] working with experts to not have it or
[6547.36 - 6553.52] delay it I probably that 78 kgs could
[6551.48 - 6555.28] have gone 85 and I'm sure I would have
[6553.52 - 6558.76] had a heart problem by now because it's
[6555.28 - 6560.56] in my jeans my entire family has has
[6558.76 - 6563.36] heart conditions and cholesterol and
[6560.56 - 6566.44] triglyceride and fatty liver
[6563.36 - 6569.60] diabetes I am 100% sure I would have had
[6566.44 - 6572.56] it by by my age my dad was already
[6569.60 - 6575.64] diagnosed with a heart condition
[6572.56 - 6577.76] so I still don't have it it's a win for
[6575.64 - 6579.32] me will I not have it 5 years 10 years
[6577.76 - 6580.80] down the lane I don't know but I'm
[6579.32 - 6582.12] consciously trying not to have it at
[6580.80 - 6584.52] least at least make that effort for
[6582.12 - 6586.04] yourself 10 years down the line I will
[6584.52 - 6588.32] be sitting with you and saying hey you
[6586.04 - 6590.12] know what Ryan we did well we tried you
[6588.32 - 6592.32] know and and I think we did well we
[6590.12 - 6594.24] delayed it from 45 to 50 isn't that a
[6592.32 - 6596.84] win itself like why would one not do it
[6594.24 - 6599.48] I don't understand speaking of wins and
[6596.84 - 6601.28] getting into running every morning I
[6599.48 - 6604.04] know you have a win every morning in
[6601.28 - 6605.32] terms of your pre-marathon meals
[6604.04 - 6608.84] sometimes when you go up for a marathon
[6605.32 - 6611.92] and all so what is it and how much time
[6608.84 - 6613.44] prior because for the uninitiated out
[6611.92 - 6616.16] there they don't know that when you have
[6613.44 - 6618.16] to start at the starting line you're
[6616.16 - 6620.24] turning up sometimes at 4:35 in the
[6618.16 - 6621.80] morning at that location from your hotel
[6620.24 - 6623.16] so walk us through what is it the night
[6621.80 - 6626.16] before the preparation and your
[6623.16 - 6628.60] pre-marathon meal so uh even the
[6626.16 - 6632.84] pre-marathon party oh yes it's my
[6628.60 - 6635.72] favorite uh so so before the marathon I
[6632.84 - 6638.04] think the the previous night or the day
[6635.72 - 6640.80] I usually like like to eat really light
[6638.04 - 6643.40] and clean very clean like you know Ki is
[6640.80 - 6645.92] my goto dinner and eat really early why
[6643.40 - 6648.64] is that I think it's just easy light to
[6645.92 - 6650.60] digest keep the fiber low avoid any kind
[6648.64 - 6652.80] of load on the stomach because like you
[6650.60 - 6655.60] said that if you have to show up at 4:30
[6652.80 - 6657.92] you're waking up at 2:00 you know uh
[6655.60 - 6659.96] you're kind of exposing your body to
[6657.92 - 6661.92] your body is not used to the thing so as
[6659.96 - 6665.16] light as you can keep it focus on
[6661.92 - 6667.28] hydration what happens is see people do
[6665.16 - 6669.64] this oh we have to eat pasta before
[6667.28 - 6671.16] Marathon we eat carbs and all our meals
[6669.64 - 6672.84] why do you need pasta it's not like you
[6671.16 - 6675.40] eat pasta every day for dinner what is
[6672.84 - 6678.36] special today that you're having pasta
[6675.40 - 6680.20] carb loading happened for the countries
[6678.36 - 6682.68] where their staple diet is very
[6680.20 - 6684.56] different than ours our staple diet we
[6682.68 - 6686.52] are carb loaders we are carb loaders we
[6684.56 - 6688.68] are eating carbs in Italy Dosa sambar
[6686.52 - 6690.84] rice Roti chapati parata that's what we
[6688.68 - 6692.40] eating so what is this whole pasta so
[6690.84 - 6694.44] you see most people are suddenly going
[6692.40 - 6696.88] and eating this binging in that pasta
[6694.44 - 6699.72] whatever Outlet I I just stick to my
[6696.88 - 6701.56] kery I drink a lot of water uh you know
[6699.72 - 6704.44] eat light give all the supplements that
[6701.56 - 6705.80] we do uh you remember this one time I
[6704.44 - 6707.36] think which really worked when my first
[6705.80 - 6711.32] season of Berlin when I qualified for
[6707.36 - 6713.64] Boston we actually practiced the time
[6711.32 - 6715.80] duration of Berlin like I used to eat at
[6713.64 - 6718.16] 4 o'clock get up at some 2 o'cl try to
[6715.80 - 6720.64] go to do party and then go back and
[6718.16 - 6722.12] sleep again is revealing all the secrets
[6720.64 - 6724.40] we train professionally in different
[6722.12 - 6726.72] time zones yeah because because I think
[6724.40 - 6728.36] so so that whole ensuring that your
[6726.72 - 6730.16] stomach is clear you know you don't have
[6728.36 - 6731.56] to rush to poty you know if you're
[6730.16 - 6732.72] looking at your time trial or whatever
[6731.56 - 6734.40] you don't want to lose 2 minutes going
[6732.72 - 6736.40] to the L with the discomfort that you
[6734.40 - 6738.04] carry you you want to feel good there's
[6736.40 - 6740.16] a lot of stress stress in holding your
[6738.04 - 6741.68] poty in and trying to do a marathon
[6740.16 - 6743.64] getting up early and trying to get the
[6741.68 - 6745.56] poty signal so many of those things yes
[6743.64 - 6747.12] so I think I think a little bit of
[6745.56 - 6748.64] practice a little bit of consciousness
[6747.12 - 6751.40] of what you're eating not trying to do
[6748.64 - 6753.48] pasta parties before that you know that
[6751.40 - 6755.72] really helps before I can't believe it
[6753.48 - 6758.04] that you know that we have thousands of
[6755.72 - 6762.00] marathon runners and
[6758.04 - 6765.96] 99.99% of them never ever do a nutrition
[6762.00 - 6768.92] plan yeah because because as they it's
[6765.96 - 6768.92] not nutrition
[6770.16 - 6776.84] right all's good like you know people
[6774.40 - 6779.68] think I think people think I'm a little
[6776.84 - 6782.40] bit of a showof that I work with Ryan
[6779.68 - 6783.88] Fernando and and you know as if I have a
[6782.40 - 6786.04] lot of money I have a tree which like
[6783.88 - 6788.16] gives me money at the end of the month
[6786.04 - 6791.68] which I give to you but people people
[6788.16 - 6792.40] don't see that see it is not just for
[6791.68 - 6796.08] the
[6792.40 - 6798.48] sport it is about me and a combination
[6796.08 - 6801.08] of mean totality which is my age my
[6798.48 - 6804.16] gender uh the stage at where I'm in life
[6801.08 - 6806.76] my profession I cannot afford to do a
[6804.16 - 6809.28] 2hour run and feel sleepy in a meeting
[6806.76 - 6811.04] I'm sorry I have to show up sharp I have
[6809.28 - 6813.20] to show up as a leader because that's my
[6811.04 - 6815.16] job that's what they're paying me for so
[6813.20 - 6816.88] how do I ensure that I'm in that state
[6815.16 - 6818.64] if you're not there in my life it's as
[6816.88 - 6821.28] simple people don't see it like that
[6818.64 - 6821.28] what people do is
[6823.00 - 6827.92] choosing I don't there's no magic but I
[6825.64 - 6829.80] think also people are very conjus in
[6827.92 - 6832.40] terms of their expenditure towards their
[6829.80 - 6835.72] own body versus they will buy that
[6832.40 - 6838.32] 40,000 rupe Footwear but when it comes
[6835.72 - 6839.92] to the knowledge of what to do when to
[6838.32 - 6843.00] do and how much to do that's like I can
[6839.92 - 6845.24] wing it that's the next level people are
[6843.00 - 6847.20] willing to pay when they have the
[6845.24 - 6849.04] disease but they do not want to get a
[6847.20 - 6850.84] health checkup or a blood test you ask
[6849.04 - 6853.28] anybody for when you did your last
[6850.84 - 6856.12] Health checkup they will say blood
[6853.28 - 6858.88] test you know that I get a regular
[6856.12 - 6861.60] Health checkup done every year which is
[6858.88 - 6864.36] like full head to toe and the uh blood
[6861.60 - 6866.84] checkup blood uh report by anually
[6864.36 - 6868.88] people don't do it there's a lot of
[6866.84 - 6871.08] these incidences that you're hearing
[6868.88 - 6872.68] during these marathons and poor I feel
[6871.08 - 6874.80] really bad that people are spoiling the
[6872.68 - 6876.72] name of the sport it's not the sport
[6874.80 - 6878.52] that's causing people heart disease it
[6876.72 - 6880.52] is your lifestyle it is about being
[6878.52 - 6882.48] callous about it it is about that you
[6880.52 - 6884.44] know you started running today and in 3
[6882.48 - 6886.04] months you're running a full Marathon
[6884.44 - 6887.96] for somebody who's never done any sport
[6886.04 - 6889.48] screening no screening done you don't
[6887.96 - 6891.72] know if you have a pre-existing
[6889.48 - 6893.76] condition you you you're obese and
[6891.72 - 6896.36] you're not really taking doing anything
[6893.76 - 6898.80] about it speaking of obese you know the
[6896.36 - 6903.08] other day um most of India's obese
[6898.80 - 6905.48] because the level is of BMI is 24.6 or
[6903.08 - 6908.40] 24.7 and half a dozen of people that
[6905.48 - 6909.96] come to my clinic they're all at 26 27
[6908.40 - 6913.28] and they feel they're at normal weight
[6909.96 - 6915.92] and they start Marathon running yep and
[6913.28 - 6918.92] that extra load on your blood on your
[6915.92 - 6921.20] heart and on your knees actually causes
[6918.92 - 6923.88] you to have a side effect of damaging
[6921.20 - 6925.80] your body quick ER than a lighter
[6923.88 - 6928.52] version of yourself a healthier version
[6925.80 - 6929.48] of yourself yeah so so people don't see
[6928.52 - 6933.28] it
[6929.48 - 6936.56] for uh for a gain or a health or a
[6933.28 - 6938.20] wellness perspective for them saying you
[6936.56 - 6940.64] know as they say know the running a
[6938.20 - 6943.00] marathon is a bucket list and then from
[6940.64 - 6945.20] there it is obviously has a lot of uh
[6943.00 - 6947.08] other miscellaneous things you you know
[6945.20 - 6949.04] you get to travel it's obviously fun
[6947.08 - 6951.24] there's a Runners High there's all of
[6949.04 - 6953.32] that but the some total I think that
[6951.24 - 6956.48] whole point that it it is for your
[6953.32 - 6959.52] health it is for your well-being is
[6956.48 - 6960.92] being uh erased faster and faster and
[6959.52 - 6964.08] faster and therefore you're seeing all
[6960.92 - 6966.52] of these cases and yes people are people
[6964.08 - 6969.36] don't know where to invest they rather
[6966.52 - 6972.72] invest in a funky Jazzy car in a house
[6969.36 - 6974.60] in buying solitire and jewelry and I
[6972.72 - 6977.24] don't know what all but they are not
[6974.60 - 6980.32] willing to invest on uh you know a good
[6977.24 - 6982.64] nutritionist or even a good training
[6980.32 - 6984.00] plan yeah I see people coming into the
[6982.64 - 6986.00] gym and trying to work out themselves
[6984.00 - 6988.24] and their form is so wrong and I'm just
[6986.00 - 6990.88] thinking you've turned up in a luxury
[6988.24 - 6993.68] German vehicle but you're being so
[6990.88 - 6997.64] conduced about paying a trainer 15
[6993.68 - 7000.96] 20,000 rupees a month just to get your
[6997.64 - 7003.48] mercedesbenz in pristine shape yeah so a
[7000.96 - 7005.72] this is uh this is that this is her
[7003.48 - 7007.32] whole attitudinal shift that we need to
[7005.72 - 7011.68] have in this we to get different
[7007.32 - 7014.32] awareness yes marathon is a very um hard
[7011.68 - 7016.36] hitting sport on the human body lots of
[7014.32 - 7019.76] injuries we talked about it you
[7016.36 - 7022.52] explained a lot of things uh people who
[7019.76 - 7024.08] start running they don't know that see
[7022.52 - 7025.48] heart attack is one of the serious side
[7024.08 - 7028.48] effects so you need to do the screening
[7025.48 - 7030.48] and everything but there are smaller
[7028.48 - 7032.72] slaps that you get from running marathon
[7030.48 - 7034.56] running as the distances as the mileage
[7032.72 - 7038.40] uh go up you talked about blisters when
[7034.56 - 7041.16] you did the MDS but chaffing uh you know
[7038.40 - 7044.20] skin getting abraded is that something
[7041.16 - 7047.48] that every Runner will start to face see
[7044.20 - 7049.60] there are reasons why shaing happens uh
[7047.48 - 7051.68] and especially for women also yeah the
[7049.60 - 7054.32] most common reason and women get a lot
[7051.68 - 7055.72] of sharing around the sports bra uh Cuts
[7054.32 - 7057.20] like I used to wear the chest strap and
[7055.72 - 7060.04] I stopped wearing it because it's not
[7057.20 - 7063.08] designed for a woman women's body uh
[7060.04 - 7065.64] shaing happens because of uh particular
[7063.08 - 7067.92] reasons is that of course uh the fat
[7065.64 - 7070.24] which you know your skin bruising around
[7067.92 - 7072.24] is one reason so my recommendation is
[7070.24 - 7073.68] that you wear something sleev so you
[7072.24 - 7075.76] ensure that the Skin's not bruising
[7073.68 - 7079.44] around it but then the other reason is
[7075.76 - 7082.96] that uh you know the clothes fine fiber
[7079.44 - 7084.28] uh with use has has Fine tears and then
[7082.96 - 7086.76] they are the ones who actually cause the
[7084.28 - 7088.44] abor they become the microscopic fibers
[7086.76 - 7090.52] start getting pulled out and now they
[7088.44 - 7091.76] look like microscopic needles correct
[7090.52 - 7092.84] which is rubbing around your skin
[7091.76 - 7095.08] especially if you're doing for a long
[7092.84 - 7097.12] time so it's my discovery that so
[7095.08 - 7100.24] typically when I go for a race I try and
[7097.12 - 7102.24] wear everything new but not brand new
[7100.24 - 7105.40] right not brand new like I probably only
[7102.24 - 7108.00] want it once or twice I so I I do uh
[7105.40 - 7110.84] race day training gear training which is
[7108.00 - 7112.52] where I wear the same attire same shoe
[7110.84 - 7114.36] everything and then I replicate and see
[7112.52 - 7115.80] okay all is feeling well this is good to
[7114.36 - 7117.72] go for my race so we're get race day
[7115.80 - 7119.80] train I'm smiling because we do the same
[7117.72 - 7122.84] thing for the nutritional supplements we
[7119.80 - 7125.60] never ever give a client and I've seen
[7122.84 - 7127.80] people in Marathon runs there's a stall
[7125.60 - 7129.60] of a Sports Nutrition Company and
[7127.80 - 7131.44] they're handing out these smoothies
[7129.60 - 7132.84] they're handing out these gels and
[7131.44 - 7135.68] people will be like okay I'm going to
[7132.84 - 7139.64] try this in the marathon Race you you
[7135.68 - 7142.48] train your stomach also to run I will
[7139.64 - 7143.88] give you an example of another uh you
[7142.48 - 7146.48] know someone who runs at the same place
[7143.88 - 7147.96] I run and he had the gel for the first
[7146.48 - 7152.12] time in the New Delhi
[7147.96 - 7155.52] marathon and he he had to go to the like
[7152.12 - 7158.04] twice and and of course I mean so for
[7155.52 - 7160.64] for the uninitiated out there when you
[7158.04 - 7162.72] take a gel most gels are
[7160.64 - 7165.88] polysaccharides and some of them are
[7162.72 - 7169.44] based on kagene which is a type of seawe
[7165.88 - 7171.60] uh or it could be uh a malose based gel
[7169.44 - 7174.72] and each one of us have different
[7171.60 - 7177.76] responses like I do know people who will
[7174.72 - 7180.04] not tolerate algae or polysaccharides or
[7177.76 - 7182.80] Malto based gels and it'll just run
[7180.04 - 7185.32] through your system yeah so so I
[7182.80 - 7187.20] remember the first time I took it I I
[7185.32 - 7189.24] had a friend running with and I had to
[7187.20 - 7191.28] uh I was running in G and then I
[7189.24 - 7192.44] actually had to go to somebody's house
[7191.28 - 7194.00] because there was no wash mushrooms
[7192.44 - 7196.20] there it was like some it was not under
[7194.00 - 7197.72] my advice right no it was many years ago
[7196.20 - 7199.72] many years ago many years ago because I
[7197.72 - 7201.68] got and I and we and I knew like you
[7199.72 - 7204.84] know my friends who were having it told
[7201.68 - 7207.72] they watch out yeah so my advice to to
[7204.84 - 7208.88] anyone watching in would be that you
[7207.72 - 7211.88] actually take the gel when you're
[7208.88 - 7213.48] working at home yeah to see gut Comfort
[7211.88 - 7214.64] first correct you try any supplement
[7213.48 - 7216.36] when you're sitting down at home you
[7214.64 - 7218.88] know the L is just right over there and
[7216.36 - 7220.16] you can go and if nothing happens the
[7218.88 - 7222.44] first time then you do it on a shorter
[7220.16 - 7224.64] run yeah but um come going back to the
[7222.44 - 7228.64] shaing and everything you made a very
[7224.64 - 7232.12] valid point on trying your race Gear
[7228.64 - 7234.40] Running yeah so from that perspective do
[7232.12 - 7237.60] marathon runners change a lot of set of
[7234.40 - 7240.12] clothes equipment uh and gear on them
[7237.60 - 7242.76] see marathon is a fair how expensive it
[7240.12 - 7245.60] is if I were to take up Marathon running
[7242.76 - 7248.32] this year so I would spend how much on
[7245.60 - 7250.08] shoes and outfits and then maybe let's
[7248.32 - 7252.24] say do three or four marathons in a year
[7250.08 - 7255.16] and travel in India what would an
[7252.24 - 7259.80] average person spend uh never calculated
[7255.16 - 7262.12] it but like let's say you would need uh
[7259.80 - 7264.56] decent shoe three pairs of shoes is what
[7262.12 - 7266.44] you would need and see there is no limit
[7264.56 - 7269.32] these days like people want to buy the
[7266.44 - 7271.32] most expensive shoe uh and then people
[7269.32 - 7272.92] have the money to get like two pairs of
[7271.32 - 7274.84] the same and then they mix and match
[7272.92 - 7276.64] colors and do all kind of funky stuff oh
[7274.84 - 7279.28] yes oh yes I know a lot of people who do
[7276.64 - 7281.32] that so they buy say they will buy two
[7279.28 - 7283.40] pairs of the most expensive shoes of two
[7281.32 - 7285.68] different colors and they wear them
[7283.40 - 7287.36] opposite like for all the style ction I
[7285.68 - 7289.12] don't do anything I I can barely afford
[7287.36 - 7290.96] to get just one p for my think your body
[7289.12 - 7292.76] from inside is thinking yeah dude I'm
[7290.96 - 7294.44] going to make you run faster because
[7292.76 - 7295.36] one's blue and one's yellow yeah that's
[7294.44 - 7298.20] a new
[7295.36 - 7300.08] supplement so so so so of course the
[7298.20 - 7303.56] shoe is the most important and critical
[7300.08 - 7306.80] part of it uh the the next is the attire
[7303.56 - 7309.12] I mean you can uh you can start from
[7306.80 - 7311.12] basic to go to as far as you can go to
[7309.12 - 7313.44] and I don't want to name brands out here
[7311.12 - 7315.88] but you you know the top end Brands and
[7313.44 - 7317.76] versus that so there's no limit to it I
[7315.88 - 7320.20] think what one would really like to
[7317.76 - 7322.52] focus on is a good training uh good
[7320.20 - 7324.68] trainer you know wherever whoever
[7322.52 - 7328.52] however you would like to choose to a
[7324.68 - 7331.52] good Physio and most importantly a good
[7328.52 - 7334.32] nutrition which is if you put all of
[7331.52 - 7337.28] this it is an expensive spot but what
[7334.32 - 7339.52] happens is that people do they think
[7337.28 - 7342.12] that do you go run and you go run and
[7339.52 - 7343.80] you then you run and then you run and
[7342.12 - 7345.68] then you get injured and then when you
[7343.80 - 7347.68] get injured is when you go to Physio
[7345.68 - 7349.92] when you spend money and then you
[7347.68 - 7351.28] struggle and do all of that I'm of the
[7349.92 - 7352.80] other opinion that you know I have a
[7351.28 - 7354.96] trainer I have a professional I've
[7352.80 - 7357.92] always had a trainer I've always had a
[7354.96 - 7361.44] Gym trainer if I remember from the first
[7357.92 - 7363.32] time I went till now like I have always
[7361.44 - 7364.88] had a Gym trainer you know I don't
[7363.32 - 7366.80] remember probably I think if I took all
[7364.88 - 7368.36] the money that you spend on Gym trainer
[7366.80 - 7370.20] you'd probably been able to afford a
[7368.36 - 7371.84] German luxury vehicle by now I would
[7370.20 - 7373.32] have I could have I would I probably
[7371.84 - 7374.56] would have two houses in Mangalore if I
[7373.32 - 7377.80] would have saved all the money that I've
[7374.56 - 7379.80] spent in this sport you know and uh I've
[7377.80 - 7383.04] been training with J with with my
[7379.80 - 7385.36] running coach uh Dr Jason car for like
[7383.04 - 7387.60] what four years now almost almost same
[7385.36 - 7389.12] time a little over four years I think
[7387.60 - 7392.56] you start at 5 with you I'm going to
[7389.12 - 7395.00] start five uh I I mean I think I've
[7392.56 - 7396.88] always been to the gym uh I have
[7395.00 - 7398.68] speaking of the gym I'm trying to
[7396.88 - 7400.00] picture you in as a workout person
[7398.68 - 7401.84] because I just see you in the MDS
[7400.00 - 7403.52] running so what's your workout Style do
[7401.84 - 7406.40] you like working out in the gym oh I
[7403.52 - 7408.72] love it I mean I strength training it's
[7406.40 - 7411.48] very funny okay that if I'm exhausted
[7408.72 - 7415.00] and I've had like I'm super tired and I
[7411.48 - 7417.60] drag myself to the gym and 10 minutes of
[7415.00 - 7419.40] workout I'm a new person you won't
[7417.60 - 7421.04] believe it 10 minutes and I remembered
[7419.40 - 7423.28] that recently I think I went to the gym
[7421.04 - 7424.64] I was very sluggish I walked in and that
[7423.28 - 7426.72] lady looked at me and said I saw you
[7424.64 - 7428.96] running how much did you run I said
[7426.72 - 7430.64] whatever I don't remember and and then
[7428.96 - 7432.44] he said oh you should be resting what
[7430.64 - 7433.88] are you doing here I said this is the
[7432.44 - 7435.32] only way I can rest if I'm here at the
[7433.88 - 7438.12] gym you know so what's your favorite
[7435.32 - 7439.48] exercise then in the gym I think I
[7438.12 - 7442.52] there's no favorite I just love working
[7439.48 - 7444.12] out in the gym I think there is uh I can
[7442.52 - 7445.80] tell you what I don't like you know
[7444.12 - 7449.84] that's very simple I just don't like
[7445.80 - 7452.52] lunges you know I just for a run I just
[7449.84 - 7455.16] tell you I can like my trainer is
[7452.52 - 7456.96] struggled to get me to doing lunges I
[7455.16 - 7459.04] just don't like lunges anything else you
[7456.96 - 7460.92] tell me I am happy to do it I mean so
[7459.04 - 7462.72] even the leg press and the everything
[7460.92 - 7465.92] everything I have know I love working
[7462.72 - 7468.48] out core and leg press and back and all
[7465.92 - 7471.44] of that uh only only thing I don't like
[7468.48 - 7475.04] is those lunges I do uh to answer your
[7471.44 - 7477.16] question on my workout I do me medium
[7475.04 - 7479.64] weight strength training because I don't
[7477.16 - 7481.92] want to load my body I want to just do
[7479.64 - 7483.80] enough strength training so that I am I
[7481.92 - 7485.76] have the strength the idea is not to
[7483.80 - 7488.08] break the body I remember you at the
[7485.76 - 7490.04] start of today's podcast you said that
[7488.08 - 7491.48] you've been weight training from the
[7490.04 - 7493.80] beginning that's how you started your
[7491.48 - 7497.04] weight weight loss
[7493.80 - 7499.32] Journey you have probably two decades of
[7497.04 - 7501.64] weight training experience yes what's
[7499.32 - 7503.64] your advice to the young women of India
[7501.64 - 7506.56] who are starting their job should they
[7503.64 - 7507.96] enroll in a gym should they go for Zumba
[7506.56 - 7510.72] should they go for Marathon running
[7507.96 - 7513.84] should they go to the gym uh is going to
[7510.72 - 7517.04] the gym going to make you get muscles
[7513.84 - 7518.52] like anel schena so what what do you
[7517.04 - 7521.44] what would you tell a young girl walking
[7518.52 - 7523.20] into the room right now you know the
[7521.44 - 7524.64] first thing is that that that thing you
[7523.20 - 7525.44] said that you know you get muscle like
[7524.64 - 7528.04] Anish
[7525.44 - 7531.08] Scher I just first want to tell
[7528.04 - 7533.92] everybody that women do not have the
[7531.08 - 7537.08] hormones to develop muscles like Arnold
[7533.92 - 7538.88] shener or Rik rosan or tiger sh so for
[7537.08 - 7541.48] God's sake just stop thinking like that
[7538.88 - 7544.08] women kind of poked you because you know
[7541.48 - 7547.12] you're an ight Runner um you run in
[7544.08 - 7548.80] shots so I have people been snidey and
[7547.12 - 7551.08] said oh look at her legs they're so
[7548.80 - 7552.72] muscular have you ever got that comment
[7551.08 - 7554.60] I'm asking this from a perspective
[7552.72 - 7556.68] because women think that they weight
[7554.60 - 7558.40] train or they run they'll get muscular
[7556.68 - 7560.44] so they don't do the physical activ so I
[7558.40 - 7562.32] want to call out women from that
[7560.44 - 7564.20] perspective of thinking so that they
[7562.32 - 7566.24] don't use it as an excuse to not go to
[7564.20 - 7568.20] the gym and train or run I will tell you
[7566.24 - 7571.28] the other perspective when I go to the
[7568.20 - 7573.88] gym there are so many men who walk up to
[7571.28 - 7576.68] me and tell ask me saying what do you do
[7573.88 - 7578.04] for your legs okay so so the men are
[7576.68 - 7580.92] jealous of your leg the men are
[7578.04 - 7584.32] absolutely like you know my car so A6
[7580.92 - 7586.28] when I was in a six athlete and you can
[7584.32 - 7589.04] they would typically do this one
[7586.28 - 7592.56] particular shot of the shoe with my Cal
[7589.04 - 7594.04] from the back to show them show the Cal
[7592.56 - 7596.08] you know because they thought that I
[7594.04 - 7597.80] have the best looking Cal that whatever
[7596.08 - 7601.80] Delhi and we need to get a picture
[7597.80 - 7604.68] probably so it's so yes I do get a lot
[7601.80 - 7606.24] of compliment for for that and it is a
[7604.68 - 7609.48] combination of my strength training and
[7606.24 - 7612.12] my running so every young girl for in
[7609.48 - 7613.68] college going into her engineering
[7612.12 - 7616.80] degree or whatever degree she's doing
[7613.68 - 7619.88] going into her first job searching for a
[7616.80 - 7622.20] prospective uh partner uh to having her
[7619.88 - 7624.36] first kid or delivering her first kid
[7622.20 - 7628.08] and then doing weight loss should she
[7624.36 - 7630.72] weight train every woman wherever you
[7628.08 - 7632.92] are you must and should weight train
[7630.72 - 7636.04] just giving you some context our
[7632.92 - 7639.04] grandparents were doing weight lifting
[7636.04 - 7641.64] in their day-to-day jobs like you know
[7639.04 - 7643.72] lifting water my grandmothers to pull
[7641.64 - 7645.20] water from the well what work is that
[7643.72 - 7647.80] yeah you know your lats work out your
[7645.20 - 7649.92] arms work out bicep tricep everything
[7647.80 - 7652.68] okay washing
[7649.92 - 7655.96] clothes working your shoulders yeah you
[7652.68 - 7658.12] know lifting lifting water and carrying
[7655.96 - 7661.28] it back weighted walks weighted walks
[7658.12 - 7663.60] farmers walk is what they did so women
[7661.28 - 7667.04] have been doing weight training ever
[7663.60 - 7668.68] since it is just that we just lost
[7667.04 - 7670.76] ourselves in between somewhere and we
[7668.68 - 7672.72] thought oh my God you know what I'm
[7670.76 - 7675.12] going to have like Rik rashan's body
[7672.72 - 7677.04] type you cannot have it but but look at
[7675.12 - 7678.32] our grandparents they were so much more
[7677.04 - 7680.60] stronger they were so much more
[7678.32 - 7682.48] healthier they had stronger bone
[7680.60 - 7684.96] infrastructure look at our parents
[7682.48 - 7688.60] generation for example I think they are
[7684.96 - 7689.68] the most uh they have neglected their
[7688.60 - 7693.08] bodies the
[7689.68 - 7695.24] most and the you know why my mom goes to
[7693.08 - 7697.20] the gym I told her I said you get
[7695.24 - 7700.60] osteoporosis and you keep breaking your
[7697.20 - 7701.96] things I live in gura you are in Kolkata
[7700.60 - 7704.04] there's no way I can show I have a
[7701.96 - 7706.60] full-time job so you please take care of
[7704.04 - 7708.80] yourself first something happens I'm
[7706.60 - 7710.84] there but it'll only come if you first
[7708.80 - 7713.16] take care of yourself it's a clause so
[7710.84 - 7715.12] you watch out that day and this day she
[7713.16 - 7717.08] calls me and says my collagen is over
[7715.12 - 7718.84] can you send me if I ask her sing what
[7717.08 - 7721.00] do you want for your birthday she'll say
[7718.84 - 7722.76] get me something for the gym every other
[7721.00 - 7725.12] day she wants a new sh is she
[7722.76 - 7728.04] fashionable in the gym absolutely all
[7725.12 - 7730.08] she wants is gym clothes and gym shoes
[7728.04 - 7732.24] and you know she sees my new shoe and
[7730.08 - 7734.40] she's like oh she's ouling at my shoes
[7732.24 - 7736.76] all the time she oh that shoe color is
[7734.40 - 7738.16] so nice but your mother in her younger
[7736.76 - 7739.76] years did not work out so this is
[7738.16 - 7741.60] something that you convinced her to do
[7739.76 - 7745.00] of course so the point I'm trying to
[7741.60 - 7747.16] tell is that our lifestyles have changed
[7745.00 - 7750.36] therefore we have made this as an
[7747.16 - 7752.80] activity outside of our day in older
[7750.36 - 7754.64] days it was a combined effort like you
[7752.80 - 7756.60] know what is the definition of Fitness
[7754.64 - 7760.08] Fitness means that you're able to do
[7756.60 - 7763.00] your day-to-day activity with comfort
[7760.08 - 7764.92] and with ease that is what fit means now
[7763.00 - 7767.40] people have merged all of these and made
[7764.92 - 7771.56] one nice kery of fitness and health and
[7767.40 - 7773.44] building muscles and all hormones so why
[7771.56 - 7775.72] if our grandparents did it why is it
[7773.44 - 7776.88] that you I mean our lives today don't
[7775.72 - 7779.56] help we have a washing machine a
[7776.88 - 7781.76] dishwasher help cook zato swiggy
[7779.56 - 7783.92] whatever so we are the laziest people in
[7781.76 - 7785.84] this world so then you got to got to
[7783.92 - 7789.24] just bring in that extra activity into a
[7785.84 - 7793.00] day just to ensure that you are you're
[7789.24 - 7795.60] growing stronger in your your physiology
[7793.00 - 7797.00] and your mental as you go ahead in life
[7795.60 - 7799.36] and especially for the younger
[7797.00 - 7802.20] generation you have a whole life and
[7799.36 - 7804.48] Trust You me it's a right that you will
[7802.20 - 7807.72] have of your life wherever whoever you
[7804.48 - 7811.00] are so dude this is the only way to get
[7807.72 - 7813.00] up you know you you was we talking about
[7811.00 - 7815.04] your mom who's the older version of you
[7813.00 - 7817.24] and now she's ouling your gym clothes
[7815.04 - 7819.76] and stuff that she is weight training if
[7817.24 - 7822.72] you had to go back in a time capsule and
[7819.76 - 7825.08] meet scheta who is 15 year-old what
[7822.72 - 7828.60] advice would you give her I would I
[7825.08 - 7830.40] would actively actively pursue sport my
[7828.60 - 7832.12] uh you know I'm born from I'm in a from
[7830.40 - 7835.44] from a small town durgapur very
[7832.12 - 7837.52] conservative traditional I mean uh all
[7835.44 - 7839.44] my uh sisters got married when they were
[7837.52 - 7842.28] 18 thankfully my parents thought
[7839.44 - 7844.56] different my when I uh I mean they
[7842.28 - 7846.20] always wanted me to study and I also
[7844.56 - 7847.72] knew that there's the only way for me to
[7846.20 - 7849.08] get out of this whole setup and do
[7847.72 - 7850.80] something in my life I didn't know what
[7849.08 - 7853.28] to do but I definitely knew what I
[7850.80 - 7854.92] didn't want so that that was the only
[7853.28 - 7859.08] differentiator I think I would
[7854.92 - 7860.76] definitely have developed these habits
[7859.08 - 7862.56] uh you know when I was 15 like if you
[7860.76 - 7864.00] remember when you saw my Gene report you
[7862.56 - 7865.92] told me this that sh if you had come to
[7864.00 - 7867.28] me 10 years ago I would have made you a
[7865.92 - 7869.28] sprinter you would have been the best
[7867.28 - 7872.64] Sprinter in this country and not a
[7869.28 - 7875.44] marathon runner if I knew that I I would
[7872.64 - 7877.88] be able to do or what it does to me as a
[7875.44 - 7880.56] person I would have just only changed
[7877.88 - 7881.96] that I think I I was not interested
[7880.56 - 7884.04] because I didn't know I was like it
[7881.96 - 7886.48] didn't give me any cake because I nobody
[7884.04 - 7889.08] taught me that it is good for you only
[7886.48 - 7890.52] little bit of playing in the evening
[7889.08 - 7892.40] what did we play at that time hide and
[7890.52 - 7894.72] seek and some kind of silly stuff we
[7892.40 - 7897.28] played so that's so you're asking girls
[7894.72 - 7899.08] of today to upgrade from hideand-seek to
[7897.28 - 7900.76] knowing and getting into the gym working
[7899.08 - 7902.72] out encouraging parents to encourage
[7900.76 - 7904.92] their daughters to become fitter
[7902.72 - 7907.16] versions than they are today absolutely
[7904.92 - 7910.76] because it is it is more important
[7907.16 - 7913.20] because you know as you grow older your
[7910.76 - 7915.36] your options to do this reduces so you
[7913.20 - 7917.36] better develop the habit now because the
[7915.36 - 7919.00] more you grow old it is so more so much
[7917.36 - 7921.28] more difficult to develop these habits
[7919.00 - 7924.20] right I mean you know we are such slaves
[7921.28 - 7925.76] to how we have been that if I tell today
[7924.20 - 7927.56] to bring a change it's going to be so
[7925.76 - 7929.44] much more difficult we need we need
[7927.56 - 7931.44] external guidance to develop inculcate
[7929.44 - 7933.52] certain habits so so develop those
[7931.44 - 7935.60] habits in your children today especially
[7933.52 - 7937.28] children today and it's a responsibility
[7935.60 - 7938.96] of the parents because in the world of
[7937.28 - 7941.24] digital where everything is happening on
[7938.96 - 7944.28] a click of a button I mean one click in
[7941.24 - 7945.96] you are gone so you better backck up now
[7944.28 - 7947.92] speaking of Clips we coming to the end
[7945.96 - 7952.12] of our podcast so we're going to do some
[7947.92 - 7954.48] rapid fire clicks um few questions okay
[7952.12 - 7957.32] um and quick clicks three things that
[7954.48 - 7963.00] you'll carry when you go to the gym
[7957.32 - 7965.76] water uh I think a jacket and uh my
[7963.00 - 7968.36] watch top three habits that made you a
[7965.76 - 7971.44] great athlete
[7968.36 - 7974.20] discipline patience
[7971.44 - 7978.80] and not fearing to spend getting an
[7974.20 - 7982.28] expert team wow it's an
[7978.80 - 7985.04] habit your favorite cheat
[7982.28 - 7988.84] meal honestly Pizza which is not
[7985.04 - 7991.08] glutenfree but since I refrain from it I
[7988.84 - 7994.28] think th your biggest inspiration in
[7991.08 - 7997.60] sports and why that person I have a lot
[7994.28 - 8001.96] of sports people I look up to you know
[7997.60 - 8005.32] and uh I think Federer dhon
[8001.96 - 8006.88] uh for people who who Show and Tell I
[8005.32 - 8009.88] think they have been consistent over
[8006.88 - 8013.20] years I especially especially like doni
[8009.88 - 8014.96] because I think he is he's always shown
[8013.20 - 8016.68] uh everything that a good athlete should
[8014.96 - 8018.68] have which is most importantly a good
[8016.68 - 8020.64] attitude you know coming from the
[8018.68 - 8022.64] background that he's come I think he's
[8020.64 - 8024.92] he's he's been a tremendous Sports
[8022.64 - 8026.68] person if not a marathon runner
[8024.92 - 8029.40] Conquering the MDS one of the most
[8026.68 - 8032.04] grueling races in the world and another
[8029.40 - 8035.52] life what would you be a tennis
[8032.04 - 8038.56] player so still Sports still Sports yeah
[8035.52 - 8040.16] I have I always always admired tennis
[8038.56 - 8041.40] and when I was in Bangalore I actually
[8040.16 - 8044.80] used to play
[8041.40 - 8047.28] tennis uh and uh I think I would be a
[8044.80 - 8050.44] tennis player professionally if you ask
[8047.28 - 8053.76] me I'd probably become a professor or a
[8050.44 - 8056.36] doctor because that's I wanted to become
[8053.76 - 8059.28] both you are now the professor of
[8056.36 - 8061.64] running and the doctor of all the
[8059.28 - 8063.20] physiology in the human body because in
[8061.64 - 8065.16] my opinion sometimes she looks at my
[8063.20 - 8067.32] nutrition PL like I think you forgot to
[8065.16 - 8068.76] give me L cartin because my fat
[8067.32 - 8070.12] percentage has gone up a little bit too
