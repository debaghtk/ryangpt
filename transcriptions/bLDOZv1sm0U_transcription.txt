[0.24 - 4.08] imagine calories like children in a
[2.24 - 5.92] classroom some children are noisy some
[4.08 - 7.72] children are stubborn some children are
[5.92 - 10.72] geniuses some children are creatives
[7.72 - 12.68] food is based on protein carbs fats
[10.72 - 14.80] vitamins and minerals these five
[12.68 - 17.12] ingredients make up the component of a
[14.80 - 18.96] food we're getting confused today when
[17.12 - 21.68] all of these processed so-called healthy
[18.96 - 23.80] foods come in food coming in from nature
[21.68 - 25.56] not processed that is it doesn't go
[23.80 - 28.20] through a factory and put into a plastic
[25.56 - 30.56] bag is the Pure Food so those are the
[28.20 - 33.04] most valuable calories that can get I'll
[30.56 - 35.88] give you a very simple example glass of
[33.04 - 38.36] milk cup of C tablespoon of ghee which
[35.88 - 40.64] is most processed is ghee because you
[38.36 - 43.08] have to extract it so let's not make
[40.64 - 45.20] this mistake when we say that all
[43.08 - 47.48] calories can be consumed anyhow it
[45.20 - 49.72] doesn't matter when it comes from nature
[47.48 - 52.16] the calories better we eating too much
[49.72 - 56.76] of processed foods and if you go with
[52.16 - 56.76] nature I believe you can't over eat
