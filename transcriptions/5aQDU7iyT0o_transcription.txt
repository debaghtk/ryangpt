Transcript: So reading this newspaper is a great thing that I do every day and I caught this in my eye again the last time I did a c it was for constipation a product and this time it was a cancer Warrior feature now when I'm looking at this article as a nutritionist I'm constantly thinking cars you know bikes good brands politicians all coming on the front page but when medical issues start turning up on the front page as a feature either as an ad or as a mention I'm getting more and more worried that I'm not doing my job what is my job as a wellness coach as a health coach as a nutritionist as a medical biochemist my job is to find ways for people to eat healthier and live healthier you see the rising sea of cancer is because we have become more affluent as a society we are spending lesser on traditional foods and more on junk food and processed foods if you see today's day and age a lot of the so-called manufacturers of beverages are looking at labeling their food as health foods packaging it and trying to sell it to you under the guise of healthy food ladies and gentlemen healthy food is garka healthy food is DAL chavel rooty we are getting more cancers today because of the insecticides and pesticides in our food chain try and begin to eat organic cancer therapy goes into lacks of rupees you also lose your life in the Battle of cancer for many people so what can you do try and buy your Staples early on in your life your rice your Roy your vegetables your fruits your pulses your D see if you can go organic that's my first battle second is fasting is

mutations happen at the DNA level where the cell becomes a Gunda and says I'm not going to die out naturally I'm going to behave like this Gunda and cause more Gunda cells more cancerous cells to be

much on our e-commerce apps too much of sugar in the IPL too much of food in the IPL why IPL when I'm watching TV I'm distracted I want to eat chips I want to eat soda I want to eat uh all of these things that are adding calorie burden now if you and I lived 1,000 years ago why 1,000 years 200 years ago there was no TV there was no electricity so we went to sleep by 7:00 in the evening so we were not eating extra this eating extra is compounding the sugar fueling of these cancerous cells over a period of time now initially in your younger years you have the necessary battling cells the soldier cells in your body to go and punch these cancer cells out but as you grow older 45 55 65 75 these cancer cells become more dominant and your soldier cells become less empowered because your
