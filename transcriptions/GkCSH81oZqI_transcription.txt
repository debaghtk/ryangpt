[130.72 - 136.68] nice to have you today so how was your
[133.08 - 140.04] flight oh it's a long flight around 10
[136.68 - 143.60] 10 hours from Japan yeah and um you know
[140.04 - 145.80] you have been uh in Japan you worked
[143.60 - 148.44] across the world and and the reason I
[145.80 - 152.64] decided to invite you in here today was
[148.44 - 155.16] to ask you about Japanese uh the culture
[152.64 - 157.52] and also your company uh but as a
[155.16 - 159.52] nutritionist I want to start first about
[157.52 - 162.24] food okay right have you had your
[159.52 - 165.44] breakfast yeah huh what was for
[162.24 - 168.84] breakfast Indian food oh so you love
[165.44 - 171.80] Indian food yes okay wonderful is there
[168.84 - 174.12] anything in Japanese culture that your
[171.80 - 177.12] parents or your grandparents talk about
[174.12 - 179.56] when it comes to food yeah we eat uh as
[177.12 - 183.12] much as of course we like but basically
[179.56 - 183.12] our culture said like
[183.68 - 192.44] har okay is saying like stop to eat my
[188.64 - 197.56] stomach feel 80% don't exceed more than
[192.44 - 200.84] 80% 100% 20% uh 12% then it will be like
[197.56 - 204.88] become fat and become full and become
[200.84 - 207.88] lazy so 80% stop keep maintain Health
[204.88 - 211.48] nicely and when do you learn this ah I
[207.88 - 214.60] don't exactly remember the company or
[211.48 - 218.40] doctor tells you no in basically in the
[214.60 - 221.16] home yeah my father mother Grand culture
[218.40 - 225.88] yes yes okay yeah to educate for young
[221.16 - 227.56] kids to stop by E 80% so so I think
[225.88 - 229.36] another thing that Japan brings to us is
[227.56 - 232.08] the very large sumo
[229.36 - 234.56] wrestler yes yes so so he that sumo
[232.08 - 236.32] wrestler eats more that is like special
[234.56 - 238.36] training special eating training is
[236.32 - 241.12] there eating training eating training
[238.36 - 245.04] every day five six seven times eat and
[241.12 - 248.20] sleep soon so two two hours like sleep
[245.04 - 250.56] and eat again sleep again sleep so and
[248.20 - 253.68] with like you know massive training so
[250.56 - 255.56] it's to become big yeah scientist yeah
[253.68 - 257.76] they say that Japan whilst you have the
[255.56 - 260.04] sumo wrestlers who are very powerful you
[257.76 - 262.84] also have the karate people you have the
[260.04 - 265.32] Samurai warrior uh you have Japan having
[262.84 - 267.72] Health Spar you have Japan having a lot
[265.32 - 270.24] of Health screenings why does the
[267.72 - 272.48] Japanese government and the Japanese
[270.24 - 276.32] people and why is it there in Japanese
[272.48 - 279.08] culture that health screening is very
[276.32 - 282.44] important so basically health screening
[279.08 - 284.76] start in the war war time in Japan at
[282.44 - 287.80] that time Japanese government wanted to
[284.76 - 290.08] make all people healthier so at that
[287.80 - 293.56] time like you know the TV uh
[290.08 - 296.72] tuberculosis spread it so all the time
[293.56 - 300.28] uh to find at early stage to remove or
[296.72 - 303.56] to treat so this was this was a original
[300.28 - 306.08] but after that change the culture one by
[303.56 - 308.88] one for example like after that it's a
[306.08 - 311.64] cancer because age become country become
[308.88 - 314.52] aging so cancer screening is become
[311.64 - 317.60] important and after that so many people
[314.52 - 319.60] become rich and eat more so then like
[317.60 - 322.24] more heart attack and diabetic this kind
[319.60 - 324.80] of happen so that's why like lifestyle
[322.24 - 328.20] screening start so it's a like a long
[324.80 - 329.40] history around 50 around 70 years so
[328.20 - 331.04] lifestyle screening is not only
[329.40 - 332.40] happening for your generation it has
[331.04 - 336.00] been happening for your father's
[332.40 - 339.12] generation also uh yeah yes yes yes
[336.00 - 342.12] cancer screening start my father's
[339.12 - 346.28] generation lifestyle Disease start from
[342.12 - 350.16] my generation I'm aged now uh 42 okay so
[346.28 - 352.84] this start around 30 years ago so tell
[350.16 - 355.36] me something uh at what age do the
[352.84 - 360.16] Japanese people go for their first
[355.36 - 363.12] screening test 22 22 M when then I join
[360.16 - 365.28] the company then start this is a company
[363.12 - 367.36] obligation I'm not able to understand
[365.28 - 371.08] what is that Japanese philosophy in
[367.36 - 373.76] India people wait to fall sick at any
[371.08 - 376.56] age and go to doctor so why is the
[373.76 - 379.76] company screening at 22 this is actually
[376.56 - 382.32] government rule mhm so uh Japanese
[379.76 - 384.92] government uh has a obligation uh
[382.32 - 387.16] everybody employee have to be in health
[384.92 - 390.28] screening mhm so when I joined the
[387.16 - 392.40] company at 22 years old every year I
[390.28 - 394.96] have to go if I don't go company will
[392.40 - 397.84] punish me I have to go
[394.96 - 399.52] so I do not want to understand our
[397.84 - 401.60] company will punish you but we will
[399.52 - 403.76] leave that for the next podcast but
[401.60 - 405.64] India if you're listening in the company
[403.76 - 407.08] says you should go for screening
[405.64 - 408.84] government insists with the company
[407.08 - 410.84] please screen your employee for their
[408.84 - 413.24] health so this is mostly lifestyle
[410.84 - 417.52] disease cleaning correct lifestyle and
[413.24 - 420.64] cancer screening okay and are there um
[417.52 - 422.52] has this helped Japan have lower segment
[420.64 - 425.20] of the population having diabetes
[422.52 - 426.88] hypertension cancer is there statistical
[425.20 - 429.08] data showing an improvement over the
[426.88 - 431.44] last 3 four decades yes it's a
[429.08 - 433.88] drastically for example like my father's
[431.44 - 436.76] age young time my father's young time at
[433.88 - 440.16] that time like many fat people are there
[436.76 - 442.20] but like nowadays it's not not much see
[440.16 - 444.40] fat people if you come to Japan you
[442.20 - 446.44] don't see much fat people I I have seen
[444.40 - 450.40] that there are no if you watch films and
[446.44 - 453.20] documentary I'm looking in the the
[450.40 - 455.32] the station the zebra Crossing uh Tokyo
[453.20 - 457.80] Street 5 intersection you're like I
[455.32 - 461.08] looking no fat people yeah everybody the
[457.80 - 464.92] same style same suit do Japanese do
[461.08 - 467.80] Japanese people go to the gym yes yes uh
[464.92 - 470.16] we go but more than that is a eating
[467.80 - 472.52] habit is controlled and the exercise
[470.16 - 475.56] also controlled okay so you're saying
[472.52 - 477.92] that the screening also at very young
[475.56 - 482.24] age gives you the
[477.92 - 485.16] awareness that oh there is a weight gain
[482.24 - 488.32] there is a blood pressure there is some
[485.16 - 491.52] cholesterol so in your personal health
[488.32 - 496.28] screening was there anything that made
[491.52 - 498.40] you change your lifestyle Behavior yeah
[496.28 - 501.40] for example when I joined the company by
[498.40 - 504.28] 22 years old with every year take
[501.40 - 509.00] screening then definitely some cab is
[504.28 - 510.92] there so when I joined the company 68 69
[509.00 - 512.92] kilo
[510.92 - 515.60] but after the certain time I become
[512.92 - 520.36] gross gross gross and reach to 80 you
[515.60 - 523.40] are 80 K 80 K whoa and age at 35 at that
[520.36 - 525.32] time every year doctor alloted me you
[523.40 - 528.32] you have to reduce you have to reduce
[525.32 - 530.40] weight and the same time this doctor in
[528.32 - 532.84] Dubai other part of world or in Japan
[530.40 - 534.56] Japan so the Japanese culture Japanese
[532.84 - 536.96] doctor all the time telling you have to
[534.56 - 539.12] reduce weight you have to exactly so he
[536.96 - 541.52] allowed many time how does the doctor in
[539.12 - 543.84] Japanese he tell you very kindly or he's
[541.52 - 548.44] taking and taking and verbally punching
[543.84 - 550.76] you nicely nicely nicely okay so then uh
[548.44 - 554.44] like he allotted and on the same time my
[550.76 - 557.92] uric acid also grows with with uh you
[554.44 - 558.76] know are you a biology student no I'm a
[557.92 - 561.24] a
[558.76 - 562.84] businessman so so suddenly the awareness
[561.24 - 566.16] is coming oh there is something called
[562.84 - 568.44] uric acid yeah exactly this is I I did I
[566.16 - 571.36] didn't know uric acid what is this but
[568.44 - 573.72] doctor told me you are here but now your
[571.36 - 577.72] kilo is weight is here and uric acid
[573.72 - 580.32] also followed so now you become 7.5
[577.72 - 582.64] basically like average is five or six
[580.32 - 586.20] more than seven is dangerous I become
[582.64 - 588.84] seven eight and then doctor said like
[586.20 - 591.04] now you have to take medicine that to
[588.84 - 593.72] reduce like uric acid otherwise your
[591.04 - 595.88] kidney will be damaged in future I and
[593.72 - 598.40] then I asked him how many how long I
[595.88 - 601.76] have to take medicine he said lifetime I
[598.40 - 604.08] said what in the age of 35 I have no
[601.76 - 606.52] problem at all my feeling but he said
[604.08 - 608.56] like lifetime you have to take medicine
[606.52 - 610.80] I said wait wait doctor I don't want but
[608.56 - 613.04] he said no that's why I'm saying to

[615.56 - 620.56] and your kidney will be protected I said
[618.20 - 622.64] okay doctor but he didn't believe me
[620.56 - 626.08] because he ared many time but I didn't
[622.64 - 630.08] take action but after that I take action
[626.08 - 633.40] so from 80 kilo 78 75
[630.08 - 636.64] now around 72 so then the uric acid will
[633.40 - 640.64] go down and doctor said good job keep
[636.64 - 643.04] your M weight at this at this level then
[640.64 - 645.36] you are healthy so that's why I'm like

[645.36 - 650.84] if I go like that my kidney damage maybe
[648.04 - 652.88] heart attack comes diabetic happen so

[794.08 - 800.28] not for the like screening Center for
[796.60 - 802.36] Healy people so that why okay why not us
[800.28 - 804.52] to do that by ourself so we made
[802.36 - 806.44] screening Center by ourself to show
[804.52 - 809.72] everyone and everybody follow this
[806.44 - 812.24] culture so I'm not like expecting like
[809.72 - 814.48] we continuously alone like that no once
[812.24 - 816.28] we start everybody follow and then
[814.48 - 819.64] everybody will do that then culture will
[816.28 - 821.56] be created so this is our aim that's a
[819.64 - 824.72] very interesting point creating the
[821.56 - 827.56] culture uh in fact um somebody asked me
[824.72 - 831.04] once that oh you are a celebrity
[827.56 - 834.08] nutritionist and only people with cash
[831.04 - 836.76] uh can come and spend on diet uh and
[834.08 - 839.88] then I thought to myself uh there was a
[836.76 - 843.20] recent research uh survey in India
[839.88 - 847.16] where uh the Indian population was
[843.20 - 850.68] spending 3 rupees 80 Pisa on fruit 3
[847.16 - 854.72] rupes 80 p on vegetable 10 Rupees 80
[850.68 - 857.44] Pisa on processed foods and beverages MH
[854.72 - 860.12] so India is a great government they have
[857.44 - 862.08] banned smoking in public places so they
[860.12 - 863.84] want to take care of us they know that
[862.08 - 865.60] smoking is injuries to putting the
[863.84 - 867.84] warning if you go on the theater if you
[865.60 - 869.88] go on television they're making them put
[867.84 - 872.76] that sign over there
[869.88 - 875.20] but when we are eating there is no
[872.76 - 877.44] warning when we checking our weight
[875.20 - 880.20] there is no warning this is culture so
[877.44 - 884.00] it is a culture that we need to change
[880.20 - 885.84] so does nura have any name specific any
[884.00 - 888.60] specifics to the name that Fuji chose
[885.84 - 891.80] nura or does it mean anything yeah
[888.60 - 895.92] actually a nura is like we make a mixed
[891.80 - 898.68] name so it's a new era it's and also new
[895.92 - 901.28] Radiology new radiology and also nura is
[898.68 - 905.28] one of the way is like we call the light
[901.28 - 907.64] so it's like if we put the light then
[905.28 - 910.56] like we can we can show the inside of
[907.64 - 913.40] the uh like our body and if Shadow is
[910.56 - 916.96] there then we can uh catch this Shadow
[913.40 - 919.44] to treat it so so Moran you're talking
[916.96 - 921.88] about Japanese culture and we know that
[919.44 - 924.84] Fuji films has been in medical equipment
[921.88 - 927.08] since 1936 yeah and now you'll have gone
[924.84 - 929.32] with this nura initiative of healthcare
[927.08 - 933.68] screening across the world and you're
[929.32 - 935.92] bringing in Ai and the Fujifilm medical
[933.68 - 938.20] pedigree so tell me a little bit more
[935.92 - 940.44] about how it happened and what was the
[938.20 - 944.40] story so basically Fujifilm is a film
[940.44 - 946.80] company H photography film x-ray film
[944.40 - 949.76] okay so from that time we start x-ray
[946.80 - 953.92] film okay F film change x-ray film to
[949.76 - 958.44] the digitized this is word fast the 0
[953.92 - 960.76] and 1980 around and then we made digital
[958.44 - 963.48] system digital system and then
[960.76 - 966.12] automatically came this AI this kind of
[963.48 - 968.60] things coming in a technology why AI
[966.12 - 971.00] start because for example like annual
[968.60 - 974.48] Health checkup health screening we need
[971.00 - 977.88] to for 100 people sick people is only
[974.48 - 980.24] one or two so health professional can
[977.88 - 982.28] focus one or two basically if in the
[980.24 - 985.28] hospital but we are doing health
[982.28 - 987.96] screening for 100 people mhm it's not
[985.28 - 989.64] possible everybody do manually to see
[987.96 - 992.12] every report exactly
[989.64 - 995.40] and also Japan now start to reduce
[992.12 - 997.84] population getting age okay so somehow
[995.40 - 1002.08] we need to manage so that's why AI came
[997.84 - 1004.72] in so doctor and Ai and AI supported
[1002.08 - 1007.52] doctor from good sensitivity point of
[1004.72 - 1012.60] view and also like a work efficient
[1007.52 - 1014.92] standpoint so fuif made like a uh it it
[1012.60 - 1017.56] technology Healthcare it and on top of
[1014.92 - 1020.68] that Ai and we implemented in the
[1017.56 - 1024.44] Japanese Market so this is a good asset
[1020.68 - 1027.16] for Fujifilm so we brought this uh
[1024.44 - 1030.52] concept to the uh India and other
[1027.16 - 1033.96] countries so originally uh automatically
[1030.52 - 1037.08] this Ai and it came in so this is AI
[1033.96 - 1039.48] embedded like screen you know when we
[1037.08 - 1041.72] take care of our health there is
[1039.48 - 1044.00] something known as mass laws law of
[1041.72 - 1047.20] hierarchy and it talks about when you
[1044.00 - 1050.40] have enough of money your bread butter
[1047.20 - 1053.12] shelter clothes taken care of then you
[1050.40 - 1054.68] think of health so more evolved
[1053.12 - 1058.96] economies will take care of health
[1054.68 - 1062.76] screening any reason why uh Fuji films
[1058.96 - 1065.40] and nura decided to enter into India and
[1062.76 - 1067.16] work with the Indian population and
[1065.40 - 1069.56] bring this culture of health
[1067.16 - 1072.24] screening yeah of course one of the
[1069.56 - 1074.80] reason is India is nowadays biggest
[1072.24 - 1078.08] population country in the world so
[1074.80 - 1081.60] everybody focusing India definitely but
[1078.08 - 1084.32] as I said Mr subin he is
[1081.60 - 1087.12] Indian so that's why I wanted to support
[1084.32 - 1089.84] his country as well but actually we just
[1087.12 - 1093.24] entered in India but not only India
[1089.84 - 1096.80] India uh and also now we uh we started
[1093.24 - 1101.00] in vetnam Hanoi and Mongolia and
[1096.80 - 1103.24] usbekistan uh Dubai Saudi it's in aan so
[1101.00 - 1105.48] this year we will expand everywhere so
[1103.24 - 1108.40] India was just first country yeah so
[1105.48 - 1112.04] Maran uh I remember you entered India
[1108.40 - 1113.16] first in Bangalore my city yeah and I
[1112.04 - 1115.92] was one of the first people to go and
[1113.16 - 1120.76] get the testing and I was a little
[1115.92 - 1123.84] skeptical a CT scan from Japan radiation
[1120.76 - 1126.84] I was a little concerned so let's enable
[1123.84 - 1129.12] my fans and viewers in terms of is there
[1126.84 - 1131.00] any danger or the screening actually
[1129.12 - 1134.16] gives you crystal ball gazing into your
[1131.00 - 1137.12] future and how is it safe actually
[1134.16 - 1139.32] everybody knows High radiation is not
[1137.12 - 1142.88] good for the body
[1139.32 - 1146.20] but we made it very ultra low dose CT
[1142.88 - 1149.28] which makes like uh no affection of the
[1146.20 - 1152.92] human body okay so by technology we made
[1149.28 - 1157.28] it so it's compared to normal City 97%
[1152.92 - 1159.64] less radiation 97% lesser so only 3% of
[1157.28 - 1163.88] radiation we are using which is same as
[1159.64 - 1166.80] normal one x-ray ah so we made it safe
[1163.88 - 1170.40] number one why we did this this effort
[1166.80 - 1171.96] because City can find only early uh
[1170.40 - 1175.64] stage of the cancer for example in the
[1171.96 - 1179.56] lung in Japan like historically like we
[1175.64 - 1182.36] are doing uh x-ray chest x-ray chest
[1179.56 - 1184.80] x-ray for example TB is okay we can find
[1182.36 - 1187.56] but small cancer we cannot find it
[1184.80 - 1189.28] unfortunately so we are doing Japan
[1187.56 - 1192.76] annual screening for the lung but
[1189.28 - 1196.24] survival rate is still only 30% this is
[1192.76 - 1199.64] number one in the world us 20% UK 20%
[1196.24 - 1201.56] India unfortunately 3% only
[1199.64 - 1203.20] if you have lung cancer exactly so
[1201.56 - 1205.04] that's why I saying screen early low
[1203.20 - 1208.20] radiation CT is the only thing that can
[1205.04 - 1211.16] capture it exactly so this we we test it
[1208.20 - 1214.28] in the globally and then if we do uh
[1211.16 - 1217.36] lung cancer screening by CT UT load CT
[1214.28 - 1220.60] survival late is more than 80% so this
[1217.36 - 1224.16] is evidence basis so we need to use Cy
[1220.60 - 1227.72] but how we can use C safely this was our
[1224.16 - 1232.12] Challenge and also c mean x-ray is one
[1227.72 - 1234.68] image C is thousand image doctor's time
[1232.12 - 1237.20] is of course it take more time so it
[1234.68 - 1241.48] will be expensive High radiation it was
[1237.20 - 1244.92] very difficult but we made AI to make it
[1241.48 - 1247.52] faster and we made it low radiation so
[1244.92 - 1250.00] we mixed so this is actually we made a
[1247.52 - 1252.64] technology so this technology come to
[1250.00 - 1254.52] India very fast so this is like
[1252.64 - 1255.28] Innovation yeah I remember when I did my
[1254.52 - 1258.76] first
[1255.28 - 1262.72] screening and uh what I liked about new
[1258.76 - 1266.16] 's report was you did my head to toe
[1262.72 - 1268.84] every system in the body the blood test
[1266.16 - 1271.24] uh the oral cancer screening the gut
[1268.84 - 1273.28] cancer screening and for my wife you did
[1271.24 - 1277.32] the ovarian cancer screening and the
[1273.28 - 1279.52] mamogram screening and um it was very
[1277.32 - 1283.20] interesting because For the First Time
[1279.52 - 1285.96] In My Life After College somebody give
[1283.20 - 1287.92] me report card Moran I got a bee for my
[1285.96 - 1290.88] blood pressure can you imagine
[1287.92 - 1294.60] nutritionist B for blood pressure so my
[1290.88 - 1297.72] thinking is now next year I go back I
[1294.60 - 1300.56] get an A oh so I think Health Care
[1297.72 - 1303.08] screening with the whole complexity is
[1300.56 - 1306.20] about bringing in Awareness but let's
[1303.08 - 1309.36] dive a little bit deeper into this whole
[1306.20 - 1313.24] experience so you're talking about low
[1309.36 - 1315.72] radiation CT but it's essential to find
[1313.24 - 1319.08] any anomalies so that is the screening
[1315.72 - 1321.80] yeah right what age do you feel in India
[1319.08 - 1324.56] we should start screening age
[1321.80 - 1327.32] yes you said Japan is 22 you started
[1324.56 - 1331.32] because company said yeah but what is
[1327.32 - 1334.28] your advice my advice is saying same as
[1331.32 - 1337.92] Japan if possible but People's Health
[1334.28 - 1342.60] will be change when 30
[1337.92 - 1347.24] 35 is changing time getting weight and
[1342.60 - 1349.96] some uh like some problem comes 35 30 so
[1347.24 - 1353.20] around this timing is like mandatory to
[1349.96 - 1355.84] start but ear year is possible it's
[1353.20 - 1359.88] better you know sometimes I tell people
[1355.84 - 1361.68] um let's um go to nura do the screening
[1359.88 - 1366.84] you are in Bangalore which other cities
[1361.68 - 1370.80] in India Mumbai Hyderabad uh G guram yes
[1366.84 - 1374.84] okay so what is unique about nura as
[1370.80 - 1377.40] compared to let's say um my other Indian
[1374.84 - 1380.96] hospitals that are also doing health
[1377.40 - 1385.00] screening new a normally hair screening
[1380.96 - 1388.20] Center people feel not you do you like
[1385.00 - 1391.76] hair screening Center B uh no I get very
[1388.20 - 1393.80] scared because in the same kidney scan
[1391.76 - 1395.76] there is patient waiting for dialysis
[1393.80 - 1397.88] exactly and that nurse is treating me
[1395.76 - 1400.88] like a patient right but I'm not a
[1397.88 - 1404.68] patient scared scared and also
[1400.88 - 1409.44] uncomfortable so and also like a long
[1404.68 - 1412.00] time like 5 hours 6 hours no fun
[1409.44 - 1416.08] do you want to pay and do you want to go
[1412.00 - 1419.48] where is no fun as a human no human want
[1416.08 - 1423.44] to come in nice place and enjoying for
[1419.48 - 1425.16] this want to pay so it's a newa we made
[1423.44 - 1427.72] us like a
[1425.16 - 1431.16] Disneyland it's actually Disneyland by
[1427.72 - 1434.44] the way I went in from my health checkup
[1431.16 - 1437.20] and I was out in 1 hour 34 minutes now
[1434.44 - 1439.28] nura says 2 hours for the whole checkup
[1437.20 - 1442.44] but uh it was
[1439.28 - 1446.20] and like I was not in a waiting room
[1442.44 - 1448.52] thinking oh I have to do this test oh I
[1446.20 - 1451.16] have to do this test oh how much time
[1448.52 - 1453.32] for the next test oh I'm waiting oh he
[1451.16 - 1457.04] came after me how come he's going before
[1453.32 - 1460.32] me my mind was like on a train just
[1457.04 - 1462.56] Clockwork and beautiful music right uh
[1460.32 - 1464.92] lovely uh green tea yeah so that was a
[1462.56 - 1468.40] great experience so I think what's
[1464.92 - 1471.28] different for you is that um you're
[1468.40 - 1473.80] making it a Disney World like experience
[1471.28 - 1475.96] they can't control the outcome right
[1473.80 - 1478.52] your health screening is in your hands
[1475.96 - 1481.12] but I think nura gives you a report card
[1478.52 - 1485.16] yes right um can you tell me a little
[1481.12 - 1488.96] bit about U like I did the visceral fat
[1485.16 - 1491.92] right I come to Japan no fat people we
[1488.96 - 1496.04] very rarely see fat people only sumesa
[1491.92 - 1498.00] that is Sport right so is it because you
[1496.04 - 1498.96] do the dexa scan and the visceral fat
[1498.00 - 1502.32] screening
[1498.96 - 1505.16] how has this uh been an experience for
[1502.32 - 1508.12] your data coming out of India are the
[1505.16 - 1510.04] Indians aware of visceral fat and when
[1508.12 - 1512.88] they become aware of visceral fat what
[1510.04 - 1515.28] is their reactions for example uh
[1512.88 - 1519.48] basically people doesn't know the word
[1515.28 - 1523.84] of B fat and inside of the body never
[1519.48 - 1528.00] see we showed inside of the your B how
[1523.84 - 1531.68] much b f you have and we just show this
[1528.00 - 1534.68] is nobody like that you are like that so
[1531.68 - 1537.92] of course if too much it cause heart
[1534.68 - 1542.20] attack cause diabetic so you have to
[1537.92 - 1545.76] reduce this image to be like that so
[1542.20 - 1548.60] people can understand easily so image is
[1545.76 - 1550.76] saying everything so we don't need to
[1548.60 - 1554.12] make people scared or something we just
[1550.76 - 1556.24] say you are like that better to reduce
[1554.12 - 1558.56] automatically people will reduce so for
[1556.24 - 1563.20] example like Fujifilm India people we
[1558.56 - 1568.56] did the screening fast year so 78 77%
[1563.20 - 1573.24] people was obese 77% yeah B fat is like
[1568.56 - 1577.16] a threshold is 100 but like 78% 77% of
[1573.24 - 1578.52] people is more than that the obase area
[1577.16 - 1582.76] but next
[1578.52 - 1585.60] year uh 68% of people could reduce it I
[1582.76 - 1587.96] asked them why how you could reduce it
[1585.60 - 1591.56] they said first before nobody said
[1587.96 - 1594.68] reduce rce weight reduce it but nura
[1591.56 - 1597.96] told us and also nura told show us the
[1594.68 - 1601.12] image Vis I was scared I was surprised
[1597.96 - 1603.68] so I want to reduce it so he take action
[1601.12 - 1605.92] by himself to reduce it so with this
[1603.68 - 1608.12] reduce the B fat automatically
[1605.92 - 1610.84] cholesterol sugar everything become
[1608.12 - 1613.88] better so nura is like not only find
[1610.84 - 1617.20] something is find and show and people
[1613.88 - 1619.00] will take like action by himself self
[1617.20 - 1622.04] motivation so this is is a important
[1619.00 - 1624.88] Point as you see blood pressure is high
[1622.04 - 1626.72] okay let use more so this is a yeah yeah
[1624.88 - 1629.20] I did a lot of breathing but this is
[1626.72 - 1631.44] very interesting that the employees did
[1629.20 - 1633.76] the visceral fat they did not know what
[1631.44 - 1635.76] is visceral fat they were able to see
[1633.76 - 1639.88] what is visceral fat they were able to
[1635.76 - 1643.00] know that Beyond 100 cm uh is too much
[1639.88 - 1645.00] viseral fat lower it down but when let's
[1643.00 - 1647.64] say we build this as a
[1645.00 - 1650.08] culture um does this exist in Japan is
[1647.64 - 1654.12] my question see you did your first test
[1650.08 - 1655.84] at 22 and uh doctor then at 30 said uric
[1654.12 - 1660.96] acid High bring down bring down bring
[1655.84 - 1664.92] down are there people who also don't
[1660.96 - 1667.56] listen because I want to know when we in
[1664.92 - 1671.24] my country of India I want to know that
[1667.56 - 1673.56] 1.3 billion people have to be healthy
[1671.24 - 1676.00] rich or poor health screening should be
[1673.56 - 1678.96] a must but there will be two types of
[1676.00 - 1681.32] people oh I know my BP is high oh I know
[1678.96 - 1683.56] my uric acid is high oh I know my Uric
[1681.32 - 1686.24] my visceral fat is high and then there
[1683.56 - 1688.60] will be some people it's okay visceral
[1686.24 - 1692.20] fat is okay so in Japan other people
[1688.60 - 1694.40] like that or how do I pr see Japanese
[1692.20 - 1697.04] have experience so what can we learn
[1694.40 - 1699.64] from that part how do we scare people or
[1697.04 - 1703.72] how do we motivate people I think it's a
[1699.64 - 1706.12] continuous uh followup is important H so
[1703.72 - 1710.00] for example me I didn't reduce the
[1706.12 - 1713.00] weight okay Dr continuously continuously
[1710.00 - 1716.52] and one they reach certain level and
[1713.00 - 1718.96] then he punish me to give medicine like
[1716.52 - 1721.60] you are be in like that so continuous
[1718.96 - 1724.08] followup is very important I think I
[1721.60 - 1726.00] think I I hear you because what could
[1724.08 - 1728.92] happen is like I have a lot of clients
[1726.00 - 1730.68] who come for diet plan nutrition plan
[1728.92 - 1733.80] and they' have been with me 5 six seven
[1730.68 - 1735.28] years initially I put them Wing scale
[1733.80 - 1738.36] this is your weight this is your fat
[1735.28 - 1740.60] percentage reduce reduce reduce reduce
[1738.36 - 1743.16] uh I do blood test also reduce reduce
[1740.60 - 1745.88] reduce but one day they get some pain
[1743.16 - 1748.88] some BP fainting or have to go to
[1745.88 - 1750.84] hospital and then doctor puts the gun to
[1748.88 - 1755.52] the head you have to
[1750.84 - 1758.44] reduce um do you think the Indian
[1755.52 - 1761.72] doctors should like my family doctor
[1758.44 - 1763.88] should they tell normal people please go
[1761.72 - 1765.20] and do your health screening in Japan do
[1763.88 - 1767.16] the doctors ask you to do health
[1765.20 - 1769.52] screening or only the companies do the
[1767.16 - 1772.84] health screening basically everybody in
[1769.52 - 1775.76] employee so everybody have to go after
[1772.84 - 1777.80] retire of 60 years old government
[1775.76 - 1782.44] support health screening for for example
[1777.80 - 1785.56] my father and mother is uh now age 79 78
[1782.44 - 1788.24] so government uh is bring the bus to the
[1785.56 - 1790.60] near the my house so they can go free
[1788.24 - 1792.84] screening so everybody have to go
[1790.60 - 1795.20] screening is a culture and also
[1792.84 - 1798.20] everybody be healthy reduce away this is
[1795.20 - 1801.56] a culture so it's not like one shot or
[1798.20 - 1803.52] something I think it's a in India once
[1801.56 - 1805.16] understand this kind of health screening
[1803.52 - 1807.76] important and reduce the weight is
[1805.16 - 1810.76] important har is important everybody
[1807.76 - 1813.24] start to talk each other this is a start
[1810.76 - 1815.96] of culture I think so that's why I want
[1813.24 - 1818.28] to bring as much as possible new to
[1815.96 - 1820.32] everywhere in the world not only India
[1818.28 - 1822.20] so then everybody take screening
[1820.32 - 1824.12] everybody understand this kind of things
[1822.20 - 1826.56] and everybody talk this will be the
[1824.12 - 1829.64] start of the culture so this is what I a
[1826.56 - 1831.40] so in the Fuji film team the culture
[1829.64 - 1833.80] everyone reduced the visceral fat after
[1831.40 - 1838.04] the first year why you reduce visceral
[1833.80 - 1839.84] fat um what are the other statistics
[1838.04 - 1842.96] that you could have seen among the
[1839.84 - 1845.40] Indian population if you observed or
[1842.96 - 1847.64] that you can share with us that I need
[1845.40 - 1849.64] to make India aware of actually India
[1847.64 - 1852.16] problem is
[1849.64 - 1854.92] obese and also
[1852.16 - 1856.80] diabetic so many people is already
[1854.92 - 1858.60] diabetic on a they don't know about it
[1856.80 - 1860.72] till this they don't know yes
[1858.60 - 1862.72] and are we finding this in the companies
[1860.72 - 1865.04] that are coming to you using neura
[1862.72 - 1868.08] screening where they're bringing younger
[1865.04 - 1870.16] people like you say 30 35 so I will send
[1868.08 - 1872.32] people voluntary meaning they're
[1870.16 - 1874.00] spending their own money to go and do
[1872.32 - 1875.96] the health screening maybe they are
[1874.00 - 1878.72] company's not aware or the company
[1875.96 - 1882.00] doesn't have the facility or whatever
[1878.72 - 1884.12] reason but the people which are testing
[1882.00 - 1886.44] in the company are you finding
[1884.12 - 1889.04] youngsters also youngsters means the new
[1886.44 - 1891.52] software Engineers bang City we are uh
[1889.04 - 1893.40] the the entrepreneurs business people
[1891.52 - 1895.32] office workers India is a growing
[1893.40 - 1897.88] Country Now companies are booming so
[1895.32 - 1899.60] we're hiring more people so 20 to 30 are
[1897.88 - 1902.56] you finding people who are having
[1899.60 - 1906.36] screening healthare problems actually
[1902.56 - 1910.28] it's a even young too much
[1906.36 - 1914.56] ber the VIS F inside and like a diabetic
[1910.28 - 1917.28] not that much in in a younger age but uh
[1914.56 - 1920.48] yeah it's mostly like Biz fat is a
[1917.28 - 1922.56] common so once reduce a Biz fat
[1920.48 - 1924.64] everything will be in the control range
[1922.56 - 1928.16] diabetic also will be control range so
[1924.64 - 1931.16] basically the dieting Health control uh
[1928.16 - 1934.08] this is a important point I think yeah
[1931.16 - 1937.60] and also one point uh for example I also
[1934.08 - 1940.80] had one experience uh in India I could
[1937.60 - 1942.96] find like H pyro in in the neural
[1940.80 - 1945.20] screening I could find the H py by
[1942.96 - 1948.20] myself and then I go back to Japan and
[1945.20 - 1951.28] Doctor confirm yes you have H py inside
[1948.20 - 1955.04] of the stomach and then hpy is a cause
[1951.28 - 1957.28] of cancer so doctor request me uh to
[1955.04 - 1960.36] take I will give medicine so you kill H
[1957.28 - 1962.76] py then three three months three weeks
[1960.36 - 1964.56] dose of antibi Jaan only one one week
[1962.76 - 1966.88] only one week only one week and I take
[1964.56 - 1968.96] medication and then H pyro is killed
[1966.88 - 1971.80] completely so doctor said congratulation
[1968.96 - 1976.12] Moran you will never get stomach cancer
[1971.80 - 1980.16] anymore I'm happy okay I'm free from
[1976.12 - 1983.88] stomach cancer so this is also in expir
[1980.16 - 1986.92] also is a many people uh has in India so
[1983.88 - 1988.36] we have to kill who decides what health
[1986.92 - 1991.52] screening to do in
[1988.36 - 1994.48] nura do you have one doctor or you have
[1991.52 - 1996.64] a team of scientists how has the whole
[1994.48 - 1999.04] process started basically it's
[1996.64 - 2000.80] everything this trend come from Japan
[1999.04 - 2004.52] okay whatever we are doing in Japan we
[2000.80 - 2009.28] are bringing plus like Innovation like
[2004.52 - 2011.68] CT basis and um like uh for example
[2009.28 - 2015.00] Imaging and immediately explaining
[2011.68 - 2017.04] everything so basically it's Japan plus
[2015.00 - 2019.72] uh this kind of innovation Plus for
[2017.04 - 2022.00] example like oral cancer is important in
[2019.72 - 2025.04] India so many people has oral cancer
[2022.00 - 2027.04] because of like Tac uh Che chewing yes
[2025.04 - 2029.20] yeah but it's not happen in Japan so we
[2027.04 - 2031.88] added this kind of things understood so
[2029.20 - 2034.24] you see what is the lifestyle of that
[2031.88 - 2037.80] country and maybe that screening is
[2034.24 - 2040.88] required uh you know in every place I
[2037.80 - 2044.32] don't know about Japan but in India
[2040.88 - 2046.96] people say ah I don't want to know I
[2044.32 - 2048.16] better not know no no no I don't want to
[2046.96 - 2050.56] know any
[2048.16 - 2053.44] screening what is your advice to them
[2050.56 - 2056.88] because see in Japan they're making it
[2053.44 - 2060.20] mandatory for a healthier country lesser
[2056.88 - 2063.04] expense on the government for um for the
[2060.20 - 2064.76] surgeries or any issues that happened so
[2063.04 - 2068.52] when somebody says oh I don't want to
[2064.76 - 2071.24] know as a Japanese person you speak as a
[2068.52 - 2073.52] Japanese person and tell India why you
[2071.24 - 2074.72] should do screening and those who are
[2073.52 - 2076.84] saying no no no I don't want to screen
[2074.72 - 2079.56] it is better not to know what should we
[2076.84 - 2082.92] tell them what should I tell them ha
[2079.56 - 2086.40] screening is not identify the cancer or
[2082.92 - 2089.52] identify the problem we can map where
[2086.40 - 2092.28] you are basically so your health is
[2089.52 - 2097.40] going where you don't know sometimes but
[2092.28 - 2101.20] we can show you are here so you reduce
[2097.40 - 2103.56] to change the rout in nice way or not if
[2101.20 - 2106.32] you have some blockage already to remove
[2103.56 - 2109.20] this blockage so it's for example like a
[2106.32 - 2111.60] cancer is no more death disease in Japan
[2109.20 - 2114.96] because we are we can find all Way by
[2111.60 - 2117.80] stage one so just remove the cancer then
[2114.96 - 2120.16] it will be so cancer is not this so
[2117.80 - 2123.44] Maran you know I sit in the nutrition
[2120.16 - 2126.72] clinic and I tell my client why don't
[2123.44 - 2128.96] you do an annual screening health check
[2126.72 - 2131.84] no no no Mr I do not want to do health
[2128.96 - 2133.88] screening check now Japanese culture
[2131.84 - 2137.16] please do health screening check what
[2133.88 - 2140.52] would be your advice as a Japanese
[2137.16 - 2143.20] person to Indians on I don't want to do
[2140.52 - 2146.08] health screening basically people want
[2143.20 - 2148.84] to know where you are by
[2146.08 - 2151.48] yourself in health you don't know by
[2148.84 - 2153.92] yourself where you are but once to the
[2151.48 - 2157.00] screening basically we can show where
[2153.92 - 2159.24] you are you are going right direction or
[2157.00 - 2162.52] you are going in different direction is
[2159.24 - 2166.92] nura is not only the to find the disease
[2162.52 - 2170.12] we can correct way prior before disase
[2166.92 - 2172.44] happen so this is how we can do that
[2170.12 - 2175.72] always we can identify the annually by
[2172.44 - 2178.16] annual screening and then from last year
[2175.72 - 2181.64] become better or not and corrected or
[2178.16 - 2184.28] not we can guide to do the healthier
[2181.64 - 2186.56] life so this is uh important for
[2184.28 - 2189.76] screening sometimes I've had some of my
[2186.56 - 2193.24] clients also come in and say that uh I
[2189.76 - 2196.52] think the test uh is not correct because
[2193.24 - 2199.12] what happens is um they go out and then
[2196.52 - 2202.80] do further health screening and doctor
[2199.12 - 2205.52] says thumbs up no problem so I'll share
[2202.80 - 2207.88] my story with you uh my wife and me did
[2205.52 - 2211.36] the nura test and for the women you do
[2207.88 - 2214.80] the ovarian screening uh so there was a
[2211.36 - 2217.16] little bit of a c score A B C D so she
[2214.80 - 2220.76] got C so I am scratching my head and
[2217.16 - 2222.96] thinking uh okay what do we do so the do
[2220.76 - 2224.96] nura says go meet a good
[2222.96 - 2227.84] gynecologist so we went to meet the good
[2224.96 - 2230.48] gynecologist she says oh this screening
[2227.84 - 2232.68] is there okay you do this test this test
[2230.48 - 2235.00] this test do this test so we went to the
[2232.68 - 2238.28] hospital did everything they did further
[2235.00 - 2241.64] screening and then came back oh zero is
[2238.28 - 2245.60] there but then that doctor asked why you
[2241.64 - 2247.56] doing this so we said we want to know no
[2245.60 - 2250.48] you don't need to know so now here's an
[2247.56 - 2251.96] an interesting thing M and India we need
[2250.48 - 2253.72] to understand this clearly the
[2251.96 - 2255.72] difference between Japanese culture and
[2253.72 - 2257.96] Indian culture and I'm not saying our
[2255.72 - 2261.36] culture in India is wrong all I'm saying
[2257.96 - 2264.84] is that when you do screening you know
[2261.36 - 2266.84] the road map like Morita son has said
[2264.84 - 2268.08] it's like saying I have to come to your
[2266.84 - 2271.24] house in
[2268.08 - 2273.76] Tokyo Moran I'm coming to your house you
[2271.24 - 2275.40] don't give me any map no Google Map no
[2273.76 - 2279.36] nothing I don't know how to reach a
[2275.40 - 2281.40] house M testing is like a road map you
[2279.36 - 2283.96] know the direction to take if the
[2281.40 - 2287.16] direction is bad you can get off that
[2283.96 - 2290.16] road direction is good continue on that
[2287.16 - 2293.76] road so with my wife we went one step
[2290.16 - 2296.40] further I asked for the genetic test for
[2293.76 - 2299.76] the cancer markers and braa 1 braa 2
[2296.40 - 2301.64] Gene test we did that test and the test
[2299.76 - 2304.36] came clear so
[2301.64 - 2306.20] touchwood the road map was given to us
[2304.36 - 2309.00] which we have never discovered but get
[2306.20 - 2312.52] this my mother-in-law is a
[2309.00 - 2316.52] gynecologist doctor so she's like who
[2312.52 - 2321.28] told you to do this test so I think I
[2316.52 - 2325.04] want to make culturally India aware that
[2321.28 - 2327.92] testing is not questioning the doctor
[2325.04 - 2330.44] testing is only telling the doctor hey
[2327.92 - 2333.04] doctor could I be your best friend not
[2330.44 - 2335.64] at 60 years of age but every year I come
[2333.04 - 2337.64] and see you at 35 years of age and and
[2335.64 - 2339.40] you be my best friend who catch catches
[2337.64 - 2342.64] me by the callar and says Ah you got to
[2339.40 - 2344.44] see start behaving yourself well
[2342.64 - 2347.08] so any
[2344.44 - 2349.32] other interesting Snippets from nura
[2347.08 - 2351.44] that you have from technology or
[2349.32 - 2353.60] experiences now being almost a year and
[2351.44 - 2355.60] a half two years in India uh from
[2353.60 - 2357.84] technology Wise from technology or even
[2355.60 - 2360.04] patience what is the success or any My
[2357.84 - 2362.96] Success is there I got B in blood
[2360.04 - 2365.24] pressure it came to a this year okay and
[2362.96 - 2367.76] and now this how my cholesterol went up
[2365.24 - 2369.64] to be so now I'm like oh I can't eat
[2367.76 - 2371.24] this fatty food I can't eat so do you
[2369.64 - 2374.04] have successes like that either in
[2371.24 - 2376.08] technology or discoveries or statistics
[2374.04 - 2379.44] that you can share with us we already
[2376.08 - 2383.04] did around 50,000 screening 50,000
[2379.44 - 2386.60] screen 50,000 screening so definitely
[2383.04 - 2389.40] maybe around 1,000 of life we protect it
[2386.60 - 2394.28] but not only number but for example like
[2389.40 - 2398.24] uh again my my teacher Mr subin he came
[2394.28 - 2400.56] last year uh two years ago Kum was
[2398.24 - 2403.76] little bit carum no problem and he eat
[2400.56 - 2405.72] it eat it no problem but last year uh
[2403.76 - 2410.48] this year he came Kum
[2405.72 - 2413.80] gross and then he's not scared and then
[2410.48 - 2416.92] last week I met with him he is don't he
[2413.80 - 2419.64] he doesn't eat birani he will eat some
[2416.92 - 2423.08] but stop in a certain time and reduce
[2419.64 - 2426.36] weight so this is for my most important
[2423.08 - 2429.28] person he start be Health here and for
[2426.36 - 2432.32] example uh my my partner Dr kashim Dr
[2429.28 - 2434.48] kashim also is now for yesterday I think
[2432.32 - 2436.80] going to dinner and then I eat
[2434.48 - 2441.40] everything everybody eat everything but
[2436.80 - 2441.40] Dr kashim stop sometime he he didn't
[2441.68 - 2447.40] eat yes yes and I asked him why you
[2444.72 - 2448.60] don't eat he said I have to reduce I
[2447.40 - 2452.52] have to
[2448.60 - 2456.20] control so definitely we are like uh
[2452.52 - 2459.76] protecting many lives for future so this
[2456.20 - 2463.44] is I think impact so we are uh we are in
[2459.76 - 2466.32] guro Bangalore Hyderabad and
[2463.44 - 2470.16] Mumbai um how can I book an appointment
[2466.32 - 2474.60] at nura what's the process yeah uh nura
[2470.16 - 2477.12] doin is our website and then um uh you

[2489.36 - 2494.64] a big population so you got to fulfill a
[2491.76 - 2497.04] lot of things so 365 days and what time
[2494.64 - 2498.60] to what time I'm a busy executive I
[2497.04 - 2500.68] don't have time to get up in the morning
[2498.60 - 2502.76] and go I've got my office I'm working
[2500.68 - 2506.72] with America time so what type to what
[2502.76 - 2509.44] time are you open uh from 8 to 5 8 to 6
[2506.72 - 2512.20] I think is like this this time is
[2509.44 - 2515.28] opening and it just takes 2 hours yeah
[2512.20 - 2517.72] so I got VIP service I think so it is 2
[2515.28 - 2519.56] hours for me or 2 hours for everybody
[2517.72 - 2521.76] everybody it's important in Japan for
[2519.56 - 2524.68] example we go in the morning time
[2521.76 - 2527.72] screening and come back to office or
[2524.68 - 2530.24] 3:00 3 Hour 3 3 p.m. I have to go
[2527.72 - 2532.32] screening Center 5:00 p.m. finish and go
[2530.24 - 2534.92] back to home so it's like not like a
[2532.32 - 2536.72] full day offer something it's a two hour
[2534.92 - 2538.56] that's it so a follow-up question is
[2536.72 - 2542.44] okay I'm I'm going I can go to office
[2538.56 - 2545.16] and everything uh do I need to go in
[2542.44 - 2548.84] empty stomach fasted state or we can go
[2545.16 - 2551.24] to nura at any time yeah nura uh is not
[2548.84 - 2554.08] not required any fasting so anytime
[2551.24 - 2557.48] people can come anytime and with eat
[2554.08 - 2560.08] food it's no problem so it's like any
[2557.48 - 2561.88] everybody can come freely anytime yeah
[2560.08 - 2564.08] in fact somebody asked me this question
[2561.88 - 2566.88] like isn't it better that I go to nurana
[2564.08 - 2570.12] fasted State and I said no look this
[2566.88 - 2574.00] screening is for the first level of a
[2570.12 - 2576.80] test uh and if we find something in that
[2574.00 - 2579.12] then we do further test in fasted state
[2576.80 - 2581.96] or subsequent tests so I don't think you
[2579.12 - 2583.56] need to really do be fasted for a health
[2581.96 - 2586.88] screening test but if you're looking to
[2583.56 - 2589.48] find a disease say like diabetes or high
[2586.88 - 2592.00] lipid profiles then you may want to do a
[2589.48 - 2593.56] 12-hour fasted state but at the end of
[2592.00 - 2595.52] the day if you're taking the day off
[2593.56 - 2597.60] from the office book your appointment
[2595.52 - 2599.56] first thing in the morning is my advice
[2597.60 - 2601.24] but if your boss is not giving you leave
[2599.56 - 2603.16] you know your body is the most expensive
[2601.24 - 2605.36] real estate then make sure you finish
[2603.16 - 2606.96] your office hours ask for early leave
[2605.36 - 2609.16] that day and go and get your nura test
[2606.96 - 2612.40] done even at 3:00 in the afternoon so
[2609.16 - 2616.68] another question is where can I go to
[2612.40 - 2618.56] book a test yeah so newa is like a
[2616.68 - 2622.28] digital in the digital space everything
[2618.56 - 2625.00] can do so you go nur. then you can find
[2622.28 - 2627.52] the telephone number or you can book uh
[2625.00 - 2630.08] uh you can select a location and then uh
[2627.52 - 2632.84] select the time and then people can go

[2656.12 - 2663.08] we can expect from
[2657.56 - 2665.40] nura H yeah so nura is as I said
[2663.08 - 2667.96] lifestyle disease and cancer screening
[2665.40 - 2669.64] so this is now current isue
[2667.96 - 2672.24] but we will start with locomotive
[2669.64 - 2675.32] syndrome locomotive syndrome is a quite
[2672.24 - 2679.60] important topic for the Aging people so
[2675.32 - 2681.36] like uh the uh sometime lay down this is
[2679.60 - 2684.32] like because of the muscle because of
[2681.36 - 2687.16] the bone health so this is also we will
[2684.32 - 2690.36] include in future and also is a dietary
[2687.16 - 2692.28] activity also hope we can work together
[2690.36 - 2695.08] and plus like we will work in the
[2692.28 - 2697.72] regenerative medicine as well so this
[2695.08 - 2700.76] new new new generative medicine uh can
[2697.72 - 2702.96] help for the people uh the more ahead is
[2700.76 - 2704.60] here awesome you know we talked about

[2775.44 - 2779.88] this is your heart this is your kidney
[2777.64 - 2781.52] this is your your liver you never see
[2779.88 - 2783.60] inside of your body it's very
[2781.52 - 2787.12] interesting it's first time you can see
[2783.60 - 2789.88] your heart visibly so you can enjoy Eno
[2787.12 - 2794.16] a lot uh sometimes people will come with
[2789.88 - 2796.92] family uh wife uh husband so everybody
[2794.16 - 2799.64] can enjoy and after screening uh we will
[2796.92 - 2801.96] give you report immediately by paper and
[2799.64 - 2804.68] the digital so people can go back to
[2801.96 - 2806.00] home so this is our work through in fact
[2804.68 - 2808.84] it's very interesting that you talked
[2806.00 - 2811.48] about you can see inside I remember when
[2808.84 - 2814.60] I did my first neura test about 2 years
[2811.48 - 2817.60] ago when he first launched and it showed
[2814.60 - 2821.12] um I I'd got a severe cold about a month
[2817.60 - 2823.32] prior and it was there for 3 weeks so I
[2821.12 - 2826.24] could see in my lungs and the doctor
[2823.32 - 2829.20] explained the full capillary Network or
[2826.24 - 2832.52] Alvi in the lungs and I could see like
[2829.20 - 2836.20] 20% of my lungs had taken a royal
[2832.52 - 2839.28] beating and uh so that visual
[2836.20 - 2842.00] image when I'm on the treadmill or I'm
[2839.28 - 2845.44] doing rowing I'm like lungs get better
[2842.00 - 2847.56] lungs get better so I'm breathing due to
[2845.44 - 2850.24] right so when we know we can see
[2847.56 - 2854.96] visceral fat or some reading or have a
[2850.24 - 2858.56] scor card I think human behavior changes
[2854.96 - 2861.88] um very interesting is that can old
[2858.56 - 2864.16] people also do the neuros screening yeah
[2861.88 - 2868.68] sometimes the people said age itself is
[2864.16 - 2871.68] a make disease because like uh maybe in
[2868.68 - 2875.08] a different way I it's a if car if new
[2871.68 - 2877.52] car basically is no problem but if 10
[2875.08 - 2880.64] years 20 years 5 50 years years if we
[2877.52 - 2883.40] use then Kasam has some trouble and the
[2880.64 - 2886.88] problem comes so basically it's better
[2883.40 - 2889.64] to uh clean up and then like a maintain
[2886.88 - 2892.20] so the higher age people is actually is
[2889.64 - 2895.52] more required for this kind of
[2892.20 - 2899.44] Maintenance Beyond neura Japanese are
[2895.52 - 2903.16] famous for so many things um what do you
[2899.44 - 2905.44] do Morita son for good health besides
[2903.16 - 2907.72] neuros screening and listening to your
[2905.44 - 2910.28] doctor is there anything unique from
[2907.72 - 2911.84] your Japanese culture that you do as an
[2910.28 - 2912.64] individual that your parents have taught
[2911.84 - 2916.12] you
[2912.64 - 2919.92] about do you drink Macha tea
[2916.12 - 2923.36] ma but my father and mother work a lot
[2919.92 - 2927.68] okay always work work work work so that
[2923.36 - 2930.64] why they are B hey so even like B some
[2927.68 - 2934.08] knee pain comes or like leg pain comes
[2930.64 - 2937.12] but with tube exercise make musle more
[2934.08 - 2939.64] strong and then treat and walk walk work
[2937.12 - 2942.84] so I think this is a very important uh
[2939.64 - 2946.04] to do the exercise plus of course eat
[2942.84 - 2949.80] less and also Mach te also every day my
[2946.04 - 2952.04] father I think five six drink of this
[2949.80 - 2954.60] cup he is drinking so I think maybe this
[2952.04 - 2957.36] is also one of the important Point yeah
[2954.60 - 2962.12] and in Japanese food has a lot of uh
[2957.36 - 2965.32] seaweed in it Nori it has Nori Seafood
[2962.12 - 2968.56] um and uh do you think that's part also
[2965.32 - 2969.92] as that you know know you have sushi and
[2968.56 - 2973.04] you have all of these things they very
[2969.92 - 2975.64] potion controlled yeah so is it part of
[2973.04 - 2979.12] uh Japanese culture to
[2975.64 - 2982.30] ovat maybe if I come to Japan and I say
[2979.12 - 2983.44] Morita son I want to eat 25 pieces of
[2982.30 - 2987.72] [Music]
[2983.44 - 2991.92] sushi would Japanese do that no only
[2987.72 - 2994.76] sues yeah yeah yeah okay so I think do
[2991.92 - 2997.60] restaurants serve smaller portions or
[2994.76 - 3000.44] serve big portions smaller portion
[2997.60 - 3003.56] basically we will uh sub small small
[3000.44 - 3007.28] small mhm so basically it's not much
[3003.56 - 3009.84] itat so it's slowly slowly eat small
[3007.28 - 3012.88] small portion that why I think we can
[3009.84 - 3016.16] feel like stomach uh in you know
[3012.88 - 3018.20] sufficient okay so with small portion uh
[3016.16 - 3022.60] I think this is important and also as
[3018.20 - 3026.84] you said is she uh the nor uh it's a we
[3022.60 - 3030.56] call wakame wakame is what it's a um uh
[3026.84 - 3034.40] she she Sheed so this we we eat she weed
[3030.56 - 3036.72] a lot with mis soup inside I think this
[3034.40 - 3039.72] uh I heard that this is very good for
[3036.72 - 3041.96] the health and but in unfortunately in
[3039.72 - 3045.12] India not much so that's why like a
[3041.96 - 3047.24] thyroid problem is happened is like my
[3045.12 - 3050.84] Japanese friend several people start to
[3047.24 - 3053.36] say like thyroid is like some
[3050.84 - 3055.76] problem but after after that he they
[3053.36 - 3058.80] brought a lot of wakame sh with from
[3055.76 - 3060.88] Japan and they eat all the time then I
[3058.80 - 3062.72] recovered I and this friend is Japanese
[3060.88 - 3065.64] Japanese guy yes oh so he was not living
[3062.72 - 3068.32] in Japan yeah he is inves in the India
[3065.64 - 3071.20] but the SE people say the same things so
[3068.32 - 3072.40] basically um screening is one that can
[3071.20 - 3075.32] tell you you have a nutritional
[3072.40 - 3077.44] deficiency um thyroid deficiency and
[3075.32 - 3079.12] then changing your food is another
[3077.44 - 3082.40] another way so Japanese do believe in
[3079.12 - 3084.96] eating healthy eating less and doing a
[3082.40 - 3088.00] lot of health screening right you know
[3084.96 - 3089.96] maritan I love Japanese culture so much
[3088.00 - 3092.96] that I even learned how to eat with
[3089.96 - 3096.24] chopsticks so I find that very unique
[3092.96 - 3099.80] and you know what I know why you are
[3096.24 - 3102.64] slim because it's so difficult to eat 50
[3099.80 - 3105.20] grains of rice with one chopstick in
[3102.64 - 3107.64] India we take the hand I can take so
[3105.20 - 3110.96] much of rice in Japan you take only this
[3107.64 - 3114.76] much of rice but speaking of Japan how
[3110.96 - 3118.12] is it is Japan okav longevity people
[3114.76 - 3121.00] live till old age or hustle bule most
[3118.12 - 3124.00] populated city in the world Tokyo what
[3121.00 - 3126.84] is it like for a Japanese youngster and
[3124.00 - 3129.52] what is it for a Japanese elderly person
[3126.84 - 3132.36] so for example like my
[3129.52 - 3133.48] grandfather and my grandmother they live
[3132.36 - 3137.00] till
[3133.48 - 3140.92] 96 years old but they were in bed when
[3137.00 - 3144.24] they 96 full healthy no full healthy how
[3140.92 - 3148.36] actually for like my grandmother uh
[3144.24 - 3151.36] always like uh move moving moving so for
[3148.36 - 3155.32] example to make some food for the kids
[3151.36 - 3159.28] uh not kids like grandkids and uh even
[3155.32 - 3161.96] she go field to make like watermelon so
[3159.28 - 3164.52] whenever we go there and he bring like a
[3161.96 - 3167.84] big watermelon I made like that and like
[3164.52 - 3170.68] you know so it's very active actually so
[3167.84 - 3175.92] my grandfather also he was like he was
[3170.68 - 3178.88] like aw lawyer before not judge so he
[3175.92 - 3182.24] always like read the book and whenever I
[3178.88 - 3185.32] go read the book and walk around it's
[3182.24 - 3188.12] active actually so I think this active
[3185.32 - 3191.04] uh work around uh move so this is I
[3188.12 - 3194.84] think one of the important uh to make
[3191.04 - 3198.60] longevity I think also in uh we see that
[3194.84 - 3202.16] when I look at videos of Tokyo like good
[3198.60 - 3204.88] cars uh tall skyscrapers Billboards but
[3202.16 - 3207.72] also people in The Crossing so in the
[3204.88 - 3209.68] cities is there anything that you see in
[3207.72 - 3212.44] Japanese culture That You Don't See in
[3209.68 - 3216.44] other parts of the world it's a busy
[3212.44 - 3218.56] City everybody walk like land so do
[3216.44 - 3221.28] people have H like is it expensive to
[3218.56 - 3224.08] own a car in Tokyo no everybody has a
[3221.28 - 3225.84] car basically but in the daytime we
[3224.08 - 3227.76] cannot use a car because too much
[3225.84 - 3230.88] population and the company also not
[3227.76 - 3233.76] allowed to come office by car not
[3230.88 - 3236.12] allowed everybody use train is it true
[3233.76 - 3237.84] that some of the trains the the station
[3236.12 - 3239.28] is in inside the building uh the
[3237.84 - 3241.20] basement of the building and you go up
[3239.28 - 3243.92] and you're in your office directly is
[3241.20 - 3248.48] yes yes yes yes many many many it's like
[3243.92 - 3252.20] everybody have to use train so uh once
[3248.48 - 3255.40] wake up prepare and go my to the my TR
[3252.20 - 3258.60] uh station by bicycle where you keep the
[3255.40 - 3261.84] bicycle in a station nobody takes a
[3258.60 - 3263.88] cycle we have organized parking there
[3261.84 - 3266.72] parking there Co and then like after
[3263.88 - 3271.32] that you know go to train and go to the
[3266.72 - 3274.44] office and the like I think the without
[3271.32 - 3277.32] any exercise I'm stepping around 6,000
[3274.44 - 3280.68] step every day so the city forces you to
[3277.32 - 3283.16] do movement right right right right okay
[3280.68 - 3286.72] and lunchtime do do Japanese people take
[3283.16 - 3288.92] lunch break yeah we take lunch break but
[3286.72 - 3293.20] uh it depends on the people but you we
[3288.92 - 3296.00] have in Hood uh Hood cod in the office
[3293.20 - 3299.28] okay and it's everything mentioned calor
[3296.00 - 3300.72] for example this menu this much calorie
[3299.28 - 3302.60] this menu this much calorie so like
[3300.72 - 3305.44] screening of your food yeah yeah yeah
[3302.60 - 3309.36] yeah it's 800 kilo calorie this like a
[3305.44 - 3314.40] chicken is 700 kilo calorie this rice
[3309.36 - 3319.44] big rice 200 this small rice uh 120 this
[3314.40 - 3324.20] small uh hey uh rice is 80 kilo calorie
[3319.44 - 3326.44] so I put take 80 and small like a fish
[3324.20 - 3328.68] it's a not fried fish it's a steamed
[3326.44 - 3331.68] fish fish okay this is a 200 kilo
[3328.68 - 3336.84] calorie steam fish steam fish yeah steam
[3331.68 - 3339.92] fish uh miso soup and small hery rice
[3336.84 - 3342.96] and uh even vegetable vegetable several
[3339.92 - 3346.16] vegetable this vegetable is like with
[3342.96 - 3349.96] like a potato is 150 kilo calorie this
[3346.16 - 3353.64] is only 20 kilo calorie I like this and
[3349.96 - 3356.96] then P so basically I try to make it
[3353.64 - 3360.88] inside of 500 kilo calorie
[3356.96 - 3362.60] in a office so I eat and go back so it's
[3360.88 - 3365.28] basically because I know how much kilo
[3362.60 - 3367.44] calorie I can spend around 2,500 kilo
[3365.28 - 3370.36] calorie in a day so it should be in a
[3367.44 - 3375.04] less so it's controlled wow that's
[3370.36 - 3377.72] amazing U the in the Japanese culture um
[3375.04 - 3380.40] you know uh you have uh tea
[3377.72 - 3383.04] ceremonies right and you said that your
[3380.40 - 3385.32] father uh drinks matcha tea four five
[3383.04 - 3389.64] times a day I as a nutritionist know
[3385.32 - 3392.48] that matcha tea has very high uh
[3389.64 - 3394.80] antioxidants so basically uh research
[3392.48 - 3398.08] has shown that Macha is very good for
[3394.80 - 3400.68] Eye Health uhhuh so it'll be very
[3398.08 - 3404.16] interesting to look into nura records of
[3400.68 - 3406.72] scanning in Japan because cataract I
[3404.16 - 3409.12] think in Japan will be the lowest and
[3406.72 - 3412.24] India will be the highest because we
[3409.12 - 3413.36] have high cholesterol food high fat food
[3412.24 - 3416.00] no
[3413.36 - 3416.84] antioxidants so that's very interesting
[3416.00 - 3421.44] but
[3416.84 - 3421.44] um holidays what do Japanese do for
[3422.28 - 3430.04] holidays it is there a concept of spas
[3425.68 - 3432.64] or or uh you go into uh the Springs
[3430.04 - 3436.08] where the water is there so uh is that
[3432.64 - 3438.96] uh SAA SAA yes and and health Springs
[3436.08 - 3442.20] and is is that part of Japanese culture
[3438.96 - 3446.28] no it's very much for example in my
[3442.20 - 3449.00] weekend basically I I love to work so
[3446.28 - 3452.36] even 24 hours I can work so end of the
[3449.00 - 3454.72] week also I'm working but it's a
[3452.36 - 3458.04] sometimes okay it's a tired okay let's
[3454.72 - 3461.44] go jogging and then in the night time
[3458.04 - 3465.48] basically after kids prepare everything
[3461.44 - 3468.92] then I go uh hot spring inside of City
[3465.48 - 3472.00] many hot spring is there okay so take
[3468.92 - 3477.08] hot spring and then like uh around 2
[3472.00 - 3479.80] hours go sauna and sweat and go water
[3477.08 - 3483.48] cold water and then hot spring again
[3479.80 - 3485.72] sauna so in one night in one night every
[3483.48 - 3487.68] every week I go and you you go hot and
[3485.72 - 3489.72] cold hot and cold hot and cold three
[3487.68 - 3490.92] four times basically no wonder your skin
[3489.72 - 3493.84] is so
[3490.92 - 3495.96] good so then become healthier so it's
[3493.84 - 3499.16] like SAA and hot spring is one of the
[3495.96 - 3503.00] good culture so final question
[3499.16 - 3503.00] Moran favorite Indian
[3503.72 - 3512.60] foods I like uh Paradise oh you like
[3507.80 - 3514.76] patas okay par and Paradise bani ah so
[3512.60 - 3516.52] that means nura in Hyderabad is really
[3514.76 - 3518.48] working well because they're always
[3516.52 - 3522.84] calling Morita San to Hyderabad and then
[3518.48 - 3524.88] he's like paradise for me yes so Moran
