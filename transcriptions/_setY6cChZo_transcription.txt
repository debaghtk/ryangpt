Transcript: I wonder if he should really shoot this one but it's about hard work and all of those who work really hard and to all the parents out there who are worried about the children who really work hard this video is for all of you because I'm a health coach and I believe your health takes priority over hard work Anna Sebastian perial was a young woman and she literally gave her life for a hard work 26 years of age full of Dreams full of potential excit of the future it's like somebody on my own team at the Quan clinics she's a school topper College topper a distinction holder in the chartered accountancy exams was excited about life just four months after joining a consultancy firm one of the largest accounting firms in the world and her passed away she died due to what her family calls work stress and I believe this exists I do see it as a boss in a company where my youngsters in my team tend to want to prove themselves now Anna was full of life her first job at eny was something she would have been very proud of but as soon as she started the excitement of her career turned into exhaustion late nights NeverEnding workloads the pressure to perform does this sound familiar if you're a hard worker it will I've been there I've done it it's the hustle culture which we have all come to accept as normal and as a health coach I think we need to take a moment to reflect is my body the most expensive real estate am I treating it well is my sleep good is my nutrition good is my brain functioning at normal or at peace let's be real for a second is it worth it her mother in a heartbreaking letter to eny India's chairman shared the painful details of Anna's last days her chest congestion her anxiety sleepless nights stress Beyond her capacity to handle she was exhausted yet she kept pushing her family begged her to quit her doctors warned her to rest but Anna felt like she couldn't stop she worked tirelessly into the night even on weekends collapsing onto her bed from sheer exhaustion only to be woken up by more messages asking for reports the cruel irony is that she was trying to prove herself but in the end her life was the price she paid this is the reality for many young professionals today we glorify over work we wear a burnout as a badge of honor but at what cost companies will always find a replacement Life Will Go On but Anna's family will never recover from this and all of those who are suffering from overw workload God forbid if you move on into the next life you cannot be replaced in your your family Anna story is not just a tragedy a wakeup call for all of us who think we need to sacrifice our health our well-being our sanity for Success Hassel culture has become a silent killer and for those of you just starting your careers I think it's time to change the narrative you see success doesn't need to come at the expense of your health I believe in what I call the office Olympian mindset where you treat your work like an athlete treats their sport it's about balance strategy and sustainability so how do you perform at your best without sacrificing yourself like Anna tragically did it starts with balance let me break it down for you number one the most important nutrition working late nights skipping meals forgetting your breakfast grabbing junk food because it's convenient too much of coffee too much of sugary Beverages and no nutrition at all all of this leads to a burnout instead I need you to focus on nutrient-rich Foods foods that fuel your brain and body not your taste bud think of it like meal preparing for a marathon if you're constantly Running on Empty you will eventually crash quick tips my favorite is start with small frequent meals nuts seeds and fruits are easy to carry snacks that you can Gra grab even during a busy day at work don't skip your breakfast and remember hydration is key dehydration leads to fatigue mood swings and even more stress I always tell all my young clients keep a water bottle at your workplace and monitor how much water you drink I cannot stress the importance for water good quality water in your workplace for your brain performance hydration prevents constipation which means you have a good bowel movement which means you don't keep toxins inside of you so drinking the right quantity of water is very key to a great energy in the workplace next exercise I'm not asking you to hit the gym for 2 hours after work even in my office I have bought gym memberships for various team members because I need them to work out but you could start with small movements even during your workday make a huge difference get up and talk to your mom and dad on the phone for 10 minutes sitting on a desk all day takes a toll on your body so move walk take a trip down to the foyer get some sunshine walk on the grass take short walks use the stairs instead of the elevator treat your body like an athlete because in the corporate world stamina is everything and I don't mean stamina at a desk I mean stamina in terms of your lifestyle ability to treat it like an athlete set reminders every hour to stretch your body you'll be amazed at how it helps with a concentration mood I do a Surya namaskar at my desk get to the side I do a blank near my desk sometimes I do dips at my desk you can all do this the point is when you're working at Breck Nate speed long hours deadlines remember to pause and do something for your body if it's exercise do something with exercise in your body Google up what is the best exercise to complete in one minute do it at your desk what is the best food to eat at office that is nutritious and healthy Google it up you'll get the answer and better still reach out to me Ryan Fernando I'll give you office snacking tips things that you can carry to the office and from my 21 minute fit.com website I will give you a manual of how you can do a quick workout to take care of your health and this something that a lot of us Overlook conscious breathing you might not realize it but in our stressful environments our breathing patterns change becoming very shallow and erratic you know you breathe in the top part of your instead of a long deep breath which is do you know when you breathe really deeply the bottom nerves at the bottom lobes of your lungs get activated and Signal your parasympathetic nervous system to relax so when you're on the go on the go shallow breathing conscious breathing can help you reset it's something as simple as taking a few deep breaths right where you are study show that slow mindful breathing calms the nervous system reduces stress and boosts mental Clarity between two Health coaching counselings I always do four long deep breaths try this with me inhale slowly through your nose for four counts and it goes like this hold for four counts exale for four counts repeat this a few times throughout the day do what I do after every call I do this for four breaths it really drops my stress levels when they high and I don't mean bad stress I mean even just work stress go go go go go go you need to reset your button for your mind and your body and now the most important thing listen to me carefully sleep is non-negotiable Anna pushed herself to work late into the night but your body needs to rest to recover just like an athlete after hard days of training you have to sleep create a bedtime routine disconnect from work at night I at home keep shouting at my clients please shut down after 9:00 don't look at your work don't look at your phones aim for 7 to 8 hours of quality sleep now this is one thing that I need you to do you see when you look at your phone you get anxiety and when you get anxiety you can't sleep so about 2 hours before you go to bed don't activate your mind towards anxiety and anxiety is the killer of you going to sleep quick and fast lack of sleep is directly linked to anxiety po performance and eventually burnout my friend Dr Shane Cado has actually shown me the studies in his book where the hippocampus is where memories and learning happen and if you sleep lesser by 2 hours the next day you have a 40% lesser productivity at work so when I have a day of shooting videos like this I sleep longer I go to bed earlier I eat my last meal 3 hours before going to sleep you see the problem is not your wake up the problem is setting the same time to sleep every day if you have a high stress job if you need to perform if you want to get that bonus which will take you to the next promotion work hard but sleep even harder with the right discipline and finally mental health I think this is something we all take for granted Anna's anxiety and stress were warning signs don't ignore them it's okay to ask for help please come to me and tell me Ryan I need help I will find you people in the country or health coaches in fact it's really a strength whether it's talking to a mentor a therapist or even a friend don't carry that burden alone don't talk to your boss talk to a friend talk talk to a mentor talk to your parents and listen to your parents if your parents say don't work this hard it's not worth it I think they your best brand ambassadors you need to work hard for your future just like your parents did but sometimes just speaking to your parents allows you to get it off your chest because then you know you're not in this journey alone somebody's there with you and if your spouse is there if you have a spouse who's working really hard what you could do is make some camomile tea with whenever my wife works late I ask her hey babes would you like some collagen or would you like some camomile tea and she'll think for 2 minutes she's like I'm so busy don't trouble me don't disturb me right now and then 2 minutes later she'll shout out babes I'd like some camomile tea and I'm off to make some camomile tea for her the reason is when your spouse or your girlfriend or your boyfriend works with you you have a lower anxiety because of the love that you receive from your parents or your companion make sure that you get that and if you live alone it can be very stressful living alone do you know what you could do play some great music which puts you to sleep or when you get up in the morning do what I did for many years when I was single I played my best songs which just picked me up and I got to work and I said yes I can take on this challenge now companies too need to change in my company I'm not only a health coach but I'm also the founder and I've got to take care of my employees so we as as companies need to change and HRS out there I'm calling you out I work with a lot of HRS and they reject health and wellness programs especially the foreign companies tend to do this it's a lot of lip service you should stop doing lip service and you need to be genuinely involved with your employees because employees today are asking in addition to giving me a salary what are you doing for me and the one thing that you can do companies for your employee is begin to guide your employee way on a work life balance yes you are doing that but on taking care of their health you need to look at their sleep you need to look at their nutrition you need to look at the exercise so corporate culture must prioritize employee well-being over short-term games overloading young professionals with back breaking work is not sustainable it's inhumane an's death should be a wakeup call for organizations whatever the cause it's a wakeup call if we as organizations continue down this path Anna won't be the last her mother's words were a plea for companies like en and Y to reflect on the toll their work environments take on human lives if you're just starting your career I'm talking directly to you now I'm talking to your parents too yes you need to work hard yes your kid needs to work hard yes be ambitious but don't let your ambition destroy your health By ignoring your health be an office Olympian somebody who balances their career with their physical mental and emotional well-being this is a marathon not a Sprint so here's what you can do today for you to become an office Olympian set boundaries for your work hours yes you can work a little longer if you have a project but prioritize your nutrition and sleep in fact I tell a lot of my media Team guys go go to sleep early get up early morning and start back your editing a lot of them what they do is they work late into the night and I'm like that affects your biochemistry that affects your mental health move regularly is another Point even if it's just a short walk in fact I tell people 20 minutes of exercise before your morning shower do a little bit of yoga do a little bit of body weight exercises if you need those workouts reach out to me in the comment section I'll send you those exercises practice conscious breathing and our company we have recruited a breath coach every Tuesdays and Thursdays he takes a 1our session teaching us how to breathe all of us were breathing long we were short breathers we now become diaphragm long breathers and you know what speak up in the workload is too much you can always change your job I know but most importantly if you love your job never feel guilty of taking care of your health I keep asking my guys guys who went to the gym yesterday day and they always look at me sheepishly sir we had a podcast to release there was no too much of time I'm talking to my cameraman sitting behind me and I'm my video editors over here we need to take care of your health and when I say we I mean the system of living healthier in conclusion today Anna Sebastian's peral story is heartbreaking it doesn't have to be repeated let's honor her memory by making sure we don't fall into the same trap of hustle culture remember your worth is not measured by the number of hours you work but how well you live your life now before you stop this video hang on a bit there's a lot of things that you could do number one get a blood test done I'm sharing the link in the descript the video is over but for for those of you who stayed this far I'm sharing the link of how you can do a blood test you want to do your liver enzymes kidney enzymes cholesterol profile and you should be doing the lipoprotein lipoprotein B homoy because these are the cardiac markers because a lot of your stress affects your heart the other thing that I want you to also do is keep a Tracker of how much of water you drink every day and best of all when you go to work can you carry a fruit or two with you I think that allows you to prevent acidity and constipation thereby keeping good gut health I don't know if you know this we actually do a microb testing which is a poop or a stool analysis and we can actually see the anxiety bacteria go up and the good bacteria that calm you and all of this can be reprogrammed by exercising and changing your diet so parents if you're listening this far and you want to gift your kids something this Diwali or this Christmas or for that matter you just love your kid and you want to gift your kids something when they're next home hit us up at the Quan nutrition clinics and we'll send you the list of blood test don't tell your kid you're getting a blood test done just make sure they don't party the previous night there's no alcohol in their system they're not gone for a run or a workout they've slept well on a fasted State get a blood sample done because you know what data and numbers shock your child into taking care of their health in addition to that you could give them an exercise program with a trainer you could also give them a diet plan which they can follow at work I know it's difficult for a lot of Bachelor kids out there but just making healthier choices and I think if I talk to my team we should be able to give you healthy snacking recipe options at work which you can go to your e-commerce apps and probably select those options which are much healthier both for your mental health your digestive health and overall make you an office Olympia now if this story has resonated with you if you have felt the same pressures let's start a conversation you could like my channel you could share this video with your colleagues better still share it with your HR and said Ryan fernandos said to send it to you because we want more Healthcare seminars we want more Healthcare benefits in our company share it with your friends with your managers I want us to create a work culture that also values health happiness and
