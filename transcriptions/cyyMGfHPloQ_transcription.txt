Title: Uncovering the Hidden Power of Water Energy ðŸ’§

Description: Masaru Emoto's experiments with water at the critical point for freezing claim that words, emotions, music, and pictures affect the crystals formed. Positive words and emotions produce beautiful crystals, while negative ones generate ugly ones. Critics have reacted to these claims. The theory of consciousness and quantum biology suggests these effects are real, and TGD inspired quantum biology offers an explanation. The explanation is based on the magnetic body carrying dark matter, communication between magnetic body and biological body using photons, TGD framework's explanation of water's special properties, and the realization of genetic code and bio-molecules as dark proton sequences and music of light or sound. The entanglement of water samples and individuals gives rise to a conscious entity expressing emotions via language realized in terms of biomolecules and genetic code.
