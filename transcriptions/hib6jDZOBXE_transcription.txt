Transcript: what's the whole thing about sleep purpose of sleeping is still poorly understood there's direct effect on every aspect of our health in terms of deep sleep and dream sleep deep sleep is necessary to flush out toxins that build up in the brain toxins build up and directly correlate with Alzheimer's and other kinds of Dementia popular demand is Dr Shane creato a double board certified sleep medicine doctor and psychiatrist is a sleep performance expert special IES some sleep with athletes and brain health psychiatrist for US Olympic and Par Olympic Committee he's also the author of the bestselling book Peak sleep performance for athlete introducing Dr Shane Cado who will fix your sleep first time ever in healthshot [Music] podcast [Applause] [Music] so welcome to heal shots with Ryan Fernando where we raise a glass to your well-being and begin a New Journey towards a healthier more vibrant you all right let's get cracking with my architect a gentleman a fellow Goen a doctor with the double board certified in Psychiatry and sleep medicine Dr Shane Cado he's written in my opinion one of the best books I've ever read on sleep it's called Peak sleep performance for athlet I'm on The Cutting Edge of making athletes win and sleep is the new diet so Dr shade has studied he's got a Bachelor's in physical therapy and then he went on to do an MD I don't think that was enough and he graduated at the top of his class so you know whenever I recruit people uh in into the qua nutrition clinics I'm always looking how good they were in school not in the subject matter but where did they graduate and so he's got the gold medal in every possible standard and he completed his Psychiatry residency uh training at the University of Wisconsin that was not what CAU my eye what CAU my eye is he's on the board of directors of the international Society for sports Psychiatry and sports players really in today's world have so much of pressure that just giving them a diet is not good enough and if you take the pressures of sport and you bring that into your daily life I think everyone has some sort of mental pressure biochemistry pressure physical pressure so I think Dr Shane would be the right person to get into heated topic where the mind will not overheat but we'll get certain Snippets and shots from him on how we can get to the next level now he's been associated with the Amen Clinics Dr Daniel Aman is a guru that I follow from the brain perspective and I get to follow him on the internet but Dr Shane gets to practice with this gentleman at the Aman clinics he's also part of the NBA Players Association the Australian football league the US Olympic and Par Olympic Committee the Miami Heats the Chicago Blackhawks and get this the Rafa Nadal Academy and so much more now why do I want him talking to us about health shots today is basically hey Dr Shane is in my opinion the Sleep Guru of the world so without further Ado Dr Shane are you there and hi good evening or good afternoon where are you speaking to me from Ryan thank you for that warm warm welcome I'm so happy to be here I'm talking to you from Chicago so it's a good morning to me and a good evening to you sir wonderful so let's get cracking I've I've got this whole list of questions that have been asked by my fans here in this part of the world so the first one why did you become a sleep doctor I mean you did Psychiatry but sleep doctor did you get enough sleep studying so much in college I got hardly any sleep in my medical prac practice which is one reason why I was fascinated with sleep but no really when we do Psychiatry training on medical training there's little to no focus on sleep and there's a massive overlap between as we'll talk about between sleep and mental health issues and General Health as well and I was staring my hair out saying why are we not learning more about sleep not just oh let's print out something from Google everyone gets eight hours but the impact of things like sleep apnea insomnia shift work on your overall health your lifestyle your quality of life concentration me mental health as well as athletic performance and so I decided to do a sleep medicine Fellowship an additional training after Psychiatry and then working with athletes and sports Psychiatry I realized even the elite athletes the sports teams the national teams going to the Olympics were not focusing on sleep in a personalized Precision driven way the way you do with nutrition and your Elite athletes the way that people focus on mental conditioning coaching or physical training they were forgetting about a personalized approach to sleep and so I said I'm just going to write a book on this stuff put it all together and kind of like create that awareness in different teams and leagues and organizations around the world so that's my mission to show people that everyone can utilize these basic sleep strategies understand your natural rhythms retra your brain and it's going to have a downstream effect of reducing disease burden across the board especially considering that it's such a prevalent issue in India awesome so let's get cracking and let's see what are the main questions that me and my listeners have asked in now the first one why is sleep important for us and why eight hours is it this like onethird eight hours you sleep one3 you work and one3 you faf around what's the whole thing about sleep yeah so it's a little more Nuance than that right the purpose of sleeping is still poorly understood however there are multiple theories and we know that there's Direct effects on every aspect ECT of our health our nervous system our cardiovascular system our immune system our GI system our brain health so sleep is important for us only because essential for survival even when they look at AI models now the AI models need their sleep so in terms of deep sleep and dream sleep broadly speaking deep sleep is necessary to flush out toxins that build up in the brain through the drainage called the glymphatic system that was only discovered in 2004 2005 so pretty recently and if you don't get enough deep sleep or non-rem sleep toxins build up and directly correlate with Alzheimer's and other kinds of dementias where is so do this deep this deep sleep is is it also known as the S SWS sleep slow wave sleep or non-ramp sleep that's absolutely right yes okay so if an athlete is measuring this and their devices are looking at Deep Sleep we're talking about the deep sleep or the S SWS sleep yes and most of the devic market is REM sleep or dream sleep and dream sleep is necessary for memory consolidation New learnings working memory and so if you're not getting sufficient dream sleep you're not consolidating the learnings from the previous day how would that help an athlete I mean an athlete just is to repeat stuff and go out and kick a ball or throw a ball so what learning is there so I mean you also work with athletes so yeah maybe I get so what comes first I'm I'm behaving like an athlete does the dream sleep come first the REM sleep comes first can I can I give up one of these guys because you know I want to watch Netflix or I got to catch a flight to go for a competition tomorrow and I don't want to go a day prior so what's it like yeah the first half of the night is more deep sleep for you're flushing out toxins cleansing your brain in the later half the night you have more dream sleep so why is it important because the same areas that control dream sleep are also necessary for emotional stability think about mental resilience mental conditioning coaching think about the plays you learned from the previous day if your opponent or your opposing team certain plays usually use your coach your team will sit down and say well this is some strategy you want to figure out especially tennis one-on-one players so if you don't get enough deep and dream sleep you're not going to be able to be able to function effectively the next day and how effective is this there's studies that show this as well so Matthew Walker did this study with depriving people of sleep versus people who got eight hours of sleep in a given night the next day their ability to retain new information dropped 40% so what's the difference hang so let's let's summarize that if I don't sleep well my ability to learn the next day drops by 40% that's right so a lot of people who deprive so does this apply only to athletes or this applies to even corporate workers and even you and me every single person so what do I read in your book and I highlighted this point and everyone should get your book if they're an athlete you wrote that for every 1.5 hours of sleep production daytime alertness drops by 32% yes so should I sleep 6 hours should I sleep 8 hours should I sleep 10 hours I go by sleep cycles of 90 minutes each not by hours anymore please enlighten me on this yes absolutely so one sleep cycle which includes deep dream light sleep is around 90 minutes for the average person so 7 and 1 half hours of sleep is five sleep cycles of 90 minutes each most adults need around 7 and a half hours of sleep if you're younger if you're a teenager you need closer to 9 or 10 hours of sleep one second so are you saying the younger you are the more sleep you need yes look at baby my son is going to school he's going for tutions he to get up in the morning he just get seven hours of sleep yeah I used to do the same thing and I look back and say what was I doing I was in Stannis laws and bandra and running around with tutions and classes it will not only reduce your ability to learn new things when we see the brain scans in the Amen Clinics the areas of the frontal lobe the the temporal lobe the back of the brain are affected with chronic sleep loss the same way our head injury patients are affected brain wise w so are you saying that you know the kids that come to me who are between the ages of say five and 15 for Sports Nutrition they should be sleeping more because if they don't sleep more their brain scans if he did one would show the same as traumatic head injury yes and why is that therefore we should not compromise on sleep but compromise on tutions and playtime and sleep more yes so 40% reduction in your memory consolidation it's like you're being sleep deprived your brain is a sponge that's already soaked it's not dry enough to take up new information now the old knowledge was that after you learn something you need to sleep to consolidate the memories yes 100% true but now we know for a fact that if your brain isn't adequately sleep fed you're not going to be able to learn anything new or even retain what you already learned I love that term sleep fed that we've learned it wrong I bet he did it wrong and I did it wrong by studying late night into exams and we didn't have more memory it's just stupidity without brain scans and modern doctors like Dr shanes so Dr Shane says let's sleep feed our brain and smaller children teenagers need more sleep than adults and everything is in the learning and there's a 40% reduction okay I'm sorry I'm affecting your Flow State but I had a question on Flow which was some one of my clients message he says how will sleeping better affect my flow State and how is the state uh beneficial for maximum efficiency now I don't I don't understand whether they mean flow State as an athlete of Flow State of sleep what do you feel is the question here okay so flow state has been popularized by Stephen Cotler as we know he's written really good books including the rise of Superman and flow state is considered a state in which Malcolm Gladwell speaks about this Brandy Brown speaks about this where you have more mental Clarity creativity and very fast decision making more intuition takes over your conscious thinking so when you look at Elite athletes when you look at suin and his matches s then when you look at alarz or feder or jokovic they just click into something else you see it you notice it from the outside but internally they just driving on intuition that's Flow State where you have a wealth of experience now you're going to the quantum level rather than the binary level is what I think about I think about the conscious brain as a binary computer the subconscious brain as a quantum computer so that's what flow state is now in terms of brain waves three primary brain waves come into play when it comes to Flow State Theta Alpha and Gamma and there's different frequencies of how fast your brain is cycling to get into those States so Theta is when you're deeply relaxed Alpha is when you're alert yet calm and Gamma is when you're in deep concentration so some combination of those three results in intuition taking over conscious thinking and it might manifest his reaction times mental reaction times physical reaction times we know that sleep the right amount of quality sleep not just quantity can actually have you work sharper be more efficient your reaction times can drop by 300% with little to no sleep a given night so think about the athletes when it comes to traveling time zones jet lag travel fatigue but what about you and your daily life what about driving to work what about your reaction times and risk of car accidents a small study showed that in daylight savings time year in the US when you lose an hour of sleep in March the next day there's a 21% increased risk of heart attacks and in the fall in the Autumn when we gain an hour of sleep when the times shift there's around a 20 to 24% drop in the heart attacks the next day car accidents much worse the day after after you've lost that hour of sleep because of the reaction times think about that in the pandemic everyone worked from home and everyone binged to watch Netflix and because they didn't have to travel to work they slept a little shorter and watched TV longer got lesser sleep and we had more uh cardiovascular incidences post pandemic there we are now you know why very very very interesting okay I'm going to go to the next question which is uh about you being a specialist in this field as a sleep doctors a sports psychiatrist in your field of practice have you found out that something that nobody else has kind of found the link like for example could the gut microbiome influence your brain and thinking capability and sleep or is there something very unique that you have found that you want to share with us oh speaking of the gut microbiome 100% the gut produces 75% for neurotransmitter so think serotonin dopamine orrine or adrenaline and it also is 80% of your immune system I'm going to keep interrupting over here so if my gut's producing 75% of my neurotransmitters the signals that my brain gets the chemicals that my brain gets it's been produces my gut so my gut is connected to my brain that's what you're saying uh yes okay hang on so if I'm mentally depressed it's not in my brain it's coming from my gut mostly from your gut so in your book you've written about junk food and so junk food is my department people eat protein C fats and you've written about this so I I want you to explain to me about the microbiome the gut neurotransmitter and about this study in Upsala University in Sweden about the two different types of food which is basically normal food and a little bit of a junk food and could you throw a little bit light on how that's affected people yeah so the gut microbiome has a bunch of bacteria and other things that need to be in healthy amounts so the healthy bacteria the top four healthy bacteria in our gut produce a B vitamins be for boy they also need Vitamin D D for dog in order to survive they can't make their own vitamin D as we all know so I'm preaching the choir over here so please stop me interrupt me correct me at any time when those bacteria produce B vitamins B vitamins are responsible for red blood cell production and nervous system help that's why pregnant women are asked to take more bead vitamins more folate for the neural development M the nervous system of the fetus so if you're not getting enough vitamin D or not having healthy amounts of healthy bacteria what's going to take over the unhealthy bacteria or disbiosis in the nutrition world and then that's going to result in a complete catastrophe Cascade as I like to call it where inflammation worsens leaky gut happens neurotransmitters go out of whack and then your body doesn't have the raw materials and ingredients it needs to make healthy amounts of neurotransmitters and hormones so that's amazing so now I'm suddenly thinking people who are depressed people who have anxiety people who just are constantly stressed out one is sleep is the new diet and diet is also slapping your gut which is slapping your brain does it also affect your sleep so I'm like okay I don't get enough of sleep but then I also eat bad so is eating bad also affecting the Sleep 100% so the gut microbiome also influences your sleep in a major major way they've done studies on feal transplants in rats where they take some feces put it in another rat and they can actually induce diseases like insomnia and narcolepsy where people just sleep too much just with changing the microbiome So when you say it's a gut feeling it's more like feeling is gut it's amazing that you talk about this because you know I've been practicing for two decades now and uh at a quad nutrition clinics we do something which is bioindividual and neutr genomics since 2010 microbiome testing about 5 years ago when it first started that's way ahead of the game wow so the the idea was bio individuality so I always believed Dr Shane that each person was a scientific study in their own right so like in the Upsala University study I remember reading that and thank you for sharing that article with me and my conclusion from that was everyone binge eats on the weekend Friday Saturday Sunday so it's high fat high sugar diets obviously alcohol and everything in that period and then the study said that the Deep wave sleep the sign wave sleep was much more erratic and lesser now I remember when uh athletes were doing hypertrophic training and they had to do faster recovery because we had just a short period of time let's say between the IPL and them going onto the World Cup the Mandate was the more more my cricketer gets deep sleep sine wave sleep so the sine wave sleep correct me if I'm wrong releases more stem cells yes which is the Rejuvenation of the human body which is a Rejuvenation so when people eat the junk food the sine wave sleep gets short circuited and so I was just thinking hey so I'm getting so it says that there was no difference in the number of hours of sleep but there was some issue on the sign and I was like okay so that really is your beauty sleep that really is what's affecting you and this is the reason why I think everyone turns up on Monday morning feeling demotivated to work no matter their profession and it's not that they hate their job it's just that they did not understand that they short circuited their diet their diet short circuited their sleep their sleep short circuited their will for going to work the next day and therefore their daytime alertness dropped by what you said 32% memory and learning dropped by 40% so I'm a zombie on Monday morning yeah you're essentially functioning as if you're jet lag the jet lag zombie and because sorry and so you're jet lag so when you're speaking of jet lag and when people come to you for brain scans I'm sure you get a lot of people who take the Exotic stuff the alcohols and the weeds and the Cannabis and all of this stuff and I do have athletes asking me Ryan what's your opinion you know and I'm like listen I'm on the Olympic doing committee you're not supposed to take this stuff do you know you can get it even in the fumes so you shouldn't be around people with the fumes what's your scientific take for us to convince people that alcohol in my opinion should have surgeons warning Dr Shane C's warning alcohol consumption is injurious to your heal what's your take on this am I wrong you're 100% right so you can talk about alcohol affecting the gut that's your expertise you can talk about alcohol damaging the brain the same patterns we see on head injuries and chronic sleep problems we see in Spec images with alcohol use it looks like a head injured like a brain injury now alcohol also while it may be sedating so it may help you fall asleep it's going to fragment that deep sleep that you spoke about earlier so sleep fragmentation means bad quality sleep which means your brain is not going to flush toxins out but people say they drink alcohol and they sleep better they fall asleep okay but they're going to wake up in the middle of the night or they might not even be aware of the fact that their brain is Wake woken up because if your brain wakes up for maybe three seconds or less and goes back to sleep you won't be consciously aware that it woke up but it may do that throughout the night and you may wake up not remember sleep scientist you're able to see this in a sleep lab exactly and you may wake up not remembering but you may feel terrible the next day what's a hangover what is feeling like crap the next day after you've had nine hours of sleep but five drinks the previous night it's poor quality sleep so we know that you know know I work with a lot of celebrities you work with a lot of celebrities we can't take names right so I can't take names of who's got a six-pack and what protein powerder I've give them and you can't tell me who's like a alcoholic but in the field of celebrity and the pressure to go and party and stuff like that have you actually done and seen wherein people have these scans done and then they decide to follow your diet which is the Sleep diet your diet which is reduction in alcohol or abstinence from alcohol and do you have a before and after scan and is there any information that you can share with our viewers will understand that there's no Hocus Pocus of these two guys talking about there actual proper Diagnostics to say that there is a massive Improvement in a person's condition yes there is and so we can look at improvements in terms of cognitive testing emotional testing subjective symptoms that they've reported sleep testing bio bi mockers like blood test like testosterone levels get boosted inflammation mockers come down cholesterol and blood sugar level markers come down and imaging verification on spec images before and after they've implemented a brain healthy protocol which includes the kind of nutrition work you do and the kind of sleep work I do we've seen brains look healthier and younger over time with changing our diets and our sleep because those things are mod iable which is what's so beautiful about it you know doc I've not even gone through half the questions that I have to do so we are going to do part two shortly but before we let you go and we come back again for part two I want to ask you a few questions staying with nutrition does hydration play an important role in the quality and duration of sleep and should we stop all fluids before bedtime and what is the last time to eat before you go to sleep so once hydration is it important should be stop stop fluids before going to bed and when's the last meal should we eat before going to bed hydration is extremely important make sure that your urine is clear looking like water then you know you're adequately hydrated why is it important it's because if your brain is partially even partially if your body is partially dehydrated your body is going to release more stress hormone cortisol so dehydration less blood volume cortisol tightens up the blood vessels so you can maintain your healthy blood pressure but stress hormones like cortisol disrupt your sleep chronic stress hormone release chronic dehydration results in shrinking of the gray matter in the brain which is necessary for memory executive functioning wow so that's how important hydration is and also hydration with the right electrolytes right sodium potassium being the primary ones now when should we stop fluids before bedtime was another question you just asked me it depends if if you've been well hydrating throughout the day great maybe an hour before bedtime you stop your fluid intake you don't want to wake up thirsty and then drink water another reason why people shouldn't be drinking a lot of alcohol or smoking weed because it makes you thirsty you're going to wake up it's going to disrupt your sleep now if you look at sleep hygiene guidelines printed out on the internet they might say no meal 3 hours before bedtime no fluids 3 hours before bedtime not necessarily one size does not fit all right it's a personalized approach so what kind of food are you consuming before bed I would say the reason they say 3 hours before bedtime no food is because sometimes there's reflux and the food can come up and then you might feel nauseous and and wake up however if you're eating healthy foods before night time so when what's he healthy you know this better than anybody else high protein complex slow carbs they maintain your energy blood sugar levels and a steady state throughout the night if you have fast carbs sugars all that junk food that we mentioned earlier it's going to burn out of your system very quickly you might have a dip in your blood sugar levels in the middle of the night middle of the night you have more dream sleep you burn as many calories as when you're awake so what's it going to do it's going to say wait a minute low blood sugar let me get some more where am I going to get it from wake up I'm going to get it from my cortisol because it pulls the muscle glycogen to convert it to glucose and then it's going to wake you up because cortisol is a stress hormone it's you're actually going to fuel the cortisol Peak earlier and higher in the middle of the night than it would otherwise the normal cortisol Peak is between 4: and 600 in the morning it slowly Rises you as your melatonin drops you'll be sabotaging your sleep wow speaking of stress I'm stressed out because we need to get you back into the next session doc a quick rapid fire Before I Let You Go name one thing you do to get better sleep sleep fixed wake up time every single day fixed wakeup time that's right awesome you heard it first I'm setting my alarm clock to get up every day at 6:05 a.m. all right see you back on the other side very soon thanks Dr Shane for joining me here today and thank you for these valuable tips for everyone watching in right now sweet dreams if you're going to sleep and if you're getting up I just hope you had enough of deep sleep thank you Ryan if you've liked this episode thene please
