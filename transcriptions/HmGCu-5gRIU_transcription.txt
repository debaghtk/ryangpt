[0.08 - 4.72] hey guys if you're not able to watch my
[2.28 - 7.00] long form content of podcast here are
[4.72 - 9.68] some short form clips for you to enjoy
[7.00 - 14.56] can you enlighten me on some of the
[9.68 - 16.60] modernday yogi rituals that all all a
[14.56 - 19.64] lot of us should aspire to or start
[16.60 - 21.56] doing to have this sort of not Nirvana
[19.64 - 23.76] but that Serene moment that you
[21.56 - 26.20] achieved firstly you would be surprised
[23.76 - 28.64] to know that I'm diagnosed with ADHD as
[26.20 - 30.36] an adult and I've taken medications for
[28.64 - 32.28] a brief period of my life I wouldn't
[30.36 - 35.52] have noticed that in today's podcast at
[32.28 - 39.12] all you're very
[35.52 - 40.56] calm so um and perhaps I lived with it I
[39.12 - 42.60] don't know but I was a sports person so
[40.56 - 44.08] I think a lot of that got worked out
[42.60 - 46.32] when we say
[44.08 - 47.52] yoga the literal meaning of the word
[46.32 - 50.12] yoga is
[47.52 - 51.36] Union right it is not an exercise form
[50.12 - 54.16] as it is made out to be it's an
[51.36 - 54.16] experiential
[54.28 - 61.88] reality so when we say Union there is
[57.92 - 64.32] always an element of invol
[61.88 - 65.28] involvement there is a misunderstanding
[64.32 - 68.36] among
[65.28 - 70.60] many if you're doing one hour of
[68.36 - 72.32] yoga and going about with your day
[70.60 - 75.16] you've done your daily quota of yoga but
[72.32 - 77.32] that's not the case yoga has to be a
[75.16 - 79.84] moment to moment reality every moment I
[77.32 - 82.04] should be in yoga because if yoga
[79.84 - 84.68] literally means Union I cannot read
[82.04 - 87.52] about Union I can't do Union I can only
[84.68 - 90.76] experience Union and Union has to be a
[87.52 - 93.04] moment to moment reality so in this
[90.76 - 95.36] moment I'm having a conversation with
[93.04 - 98.40] you am I in yoga am I completely
[95.36 - 101.08] involved with you without any
[98.40 - 104.08] discrimination without any judgments
[101.08 - 106.88] that is Yoga I'm drinking this glass of
[104.08 - 108.72] water am I 100% involved with this
[106.88 - 111.72] process that's
[108.72 - 115.32] youa doing the ASAS twisting and turning
[111.72 - 118.24] your body is just catalyzing the
[115.32 - 120.76] process but it doesn't stop there so
[118.24 - 122.28] that's the biggest misconception that
[120.76 - 126.00] people
[122.28 - 128.56] have yoga has to be a 24 by7 process so
[126.00 - 128.56] that's the first
[128.64 - 135.00] thing having said that there are various
[131.64 - 136.52] prescriptions uh which facilitate the
[135.00 - 138.96] state of
[136.52 - 141.40] involvement the first thing being waking
[138.96 - 143.44] up at Brahma Murat what is Brahma Murat
[141.40 - 145.68] Brahma Murat would be considered the
[143.44 - 148.20] last quarter of the night which is
[145.68 - 150.92] anywhere between 3:30 a.m. to 5:30 or
[148.20 - 153.48] 6:00 a.m.
[150.92 - 155.96] scientifically we say that the pineal
[153.48 - 159.16] gland is working at its
[155.96 - 160.76] best the secretion of the pineal gland
[159.16 - 162.92] the Melatonin they all of them are
[160.76 - 164.88] working at its maximum which means that
[162.92 - 166.56] being in a pleasant mood within yourself
[164.88 - 169.24] is not a
[166.56 - 171.12] problem also I believe that the nature
[169.24 - 172.68] is aligned the planets are aligned in
[171.12 - 175.68] such a manner
[172.68 - 179.40] that it creates a conducive state for
[175.68 - 182.48] you to sort of grasp anything or for you
[179.40 - 186.00] to be in a certain balanced
[182.48 - 187.84] state so typically we would utilize this
[186.00 - 190.20] time period in fact there is another
[187.84 - 192.64] study which shows that this quality of
[190.20 - 194.40] your urine is very different at this
[192.64 - 196.36] particular time in comparison to any
[194.40 - 200.84] time any other time during the
[196.36 - 202.80] day so the idea is to wake up and do a
[200.84 - 204.68] practice that you have been initiated
[202.80 - 209.36] into now when we say initiation it's
[204.68 - 210.28] about learning a yoga practice which
[209.36 - 213.08] affects
[210.28 - 215.32] your pric system which affects your
[213.08 - 218.76] energy system and what is pric
[215.32 - 220.56] system so there are multiple bodies
[218.76 - 222.88] within a human system so there is a
[220.56 - 226.84] physical body which is the anosha or the
[222.88 - 230.00] food body there is the manoosha or the
[226.84 - 232.48] Mind Body there is a Prana mosha which
[230.00 - 234.72] is the energy body and there is the
[232.48 - 237.08] vigana mosha I don't know the English
[234.72 - 240.88] equivalent of that knowledge body not
[237.08 - 242.32] quite vigana mosha and Anand mosha which
[240.88 - 247.88] is the Bliss
[242.32 - 250.56] body so what yoga is doing is that it
[247.88 - 253.08] goes to the pranam mosha which is the
[250.56 - 256.84] energy body
[253.08 - 260.28] and the help of a guru comes where you
[256.84 - 262.76] have to be pushed from the pranam kosha
[260.28 - 264.92] to the other dimensions further up Vian
[262.76 - 267.32] kosha Anand kosha that a guru can do for
[264.92 - 270.16] you which is why having a guru in your
[267.32 - 272.48] life becomes important but any teacher
[270.16 - 275.28] Any teacher who's been trained who has
[272.48 - 278.36] some good intention for you can take you
[275.28 - 281.28] to pranam kosha once the pranam myosha
[278.36 - 283.52] or the energy body is activated you will
[281.28 - 285.72] see that its benefits permeate down to
[283.52 - 287.76] the mental body so your mind is great
[285.72 - 290.44] and the physical body which is why if
[287.76 - 292.44] you see a lot of yogis especially the
[290.44 - 294.36] ones who are living in the Himalayas or
[292.44 - 295.60] somewhere let's say in the forest they
[294.36 - 297.48] don't know what they're eating they
[295.60 - 299.20] don't know what they're drinking there
[297.48 - 301.04] are minor poisons coming into their food
[299.20 - 302.76] and water all the time but you'll see
[301.04 - 304.84] that they're in great physical health
[302.76 - 306.68] their sleep quter is very Less in fact
[304.84 - 308.64] they don't even sleep there is a culture
[306.68 - 311.32] among so many yogis where they don't
[308.64 - 312.76] sleep at all because we say that sleep
[311.32 - 315.16] is a form of inertia and you want to
[312.76 - 317.56] reduce that to the best possible extent
[315.16 - 319.80] now they're not falling sick and the
[317.56 - 322.28] reason is that the pranam kosha or the
[319.80 - 326.36] energy body is fully activated and is in
[322.28 - 328.44] full flow so this is what uh the pranam
[326.36 - 330.52] kosha is so when you wake up in the
[328.44 - 332.28] morning and do your spirit rual work or
[330.52 - 336.24] your sadhana as we say your yoga
[332.28 - 338.20] practice it activates your pranam myosha
[336.24 - 340.52] which means that your mind will be great
[338.20 - 342.96] and your body will be
[340.52 - 344.92] perfect before that we say You must take
[342.96 - 347.60] a shower in the morning and a cold water
[344.92 - 349.28] shower preferably uh I was going to ask
[347.60 - 352.12] you about that because a lot of people
[349.28 - 354.16] do take a warm water bath in the morning
[352.12 - 355.76] and so how does the how did the
[354.16 - 357.04] different bodies join together with the
[355.76 - 359.88] cold
[357.04 - 362.24] shower so when we say cold shower we not
[359.88 - 364.64] looking like we're not looking at uh a
[362.24 - 367.76] temperature which is very very cold uh
[364.64 - 370.00] this would be anywhere say 5 to 8Â°
[367.76 - 371.80] Centigrade below the room temperature
[370.00 - 373.56] and this is simply because
[371.80 - 375.44] scientifically speaking we say that
[373.56 - 378.04] there are pores between the cells and
[375.44 - 381.32] when you take a cold water shower that
[378.04 - 384.52] opens up and energy begins to permeate
[381.32 - 386.16] it enters and it recharges the cellular
[384.52 - 388.12] structure so as a result of which you're
[386.16 - 390.84] much more energized you can do your sad
[388.12 - 392.16] without you know feeling drous
[390.84 - 394.00] and if it's let's say you're living in
[392.16 - 395.92] cold climatic conditions then we say
[394.00 - 397.72] lukewarm water but never hot water
[395.92 - 400.28] because the hot water opens up the cells
[397.72 - 402.00] and it creates inertia and drowsiness
[400.28 - 403.92] now for a regular individuals who's not
[402.00 - 406.68] into yoga sadna it may not matter but
[403.92 - 408.96] for a yogi who is staying up for a long
[406.68 - 410.64] time who's doing about 4 hours of sadna
[408.96 - 412.52] it can become
[410.64 - 414.92] problematic additionally I think there
[412.52 - 417.40] is a lot of literature Now by Andrew
[414.92 - 419.08] huberman for example who has extensively
[417.40 - 421.16] researched on the importance of the
[419.08 - 423.84] dopamin release
[421.16 - 425.52] correct so uh so cold shower becomes
[423.84 - 427.08] very important in the life of a yogi and
[425.52 - 430.32] we always say that you start from here
[427.08 - 433.44] and then allow the water to trickle down
[430.32 - 435.28] after that the most important thing is
[433.44 - 437.52] emptying your bowels first thing when
[435.28 - 439.72] you wake up so all of this cold shower
[437.52 - 441.68] and emptying your balls and urination
[439.72 - 444.56] should be done before you start your
[441.68 - 446.80] practice always when you wake up first
[444.56 - 449.12] thing in the morning so in traditional
[446.80 - 452.24] Sciences B Yoga ayurveda we say that the
[449.12 - 454.32] headqu qu of most
[452.24 - 457.04] diseases is the
[454.32 - 460.72] colon It's 90% of the diseases that we
[457.04 - 464.36] know chronic or otherwise is in the
[460.72 - 466.40] colon not just P are you able to
[464.36 - 468.72] completely evacuate your BS so we say it
[466.40 - 470.48] should be as clean as a water pipe in
[468.72 - 471.92] fact there's a culture among the yogis a
[470.48 - 474.56] certain sect of yogis where they use the
[471.92 - 476.40] anal cavity as a suction pipe they suck
[474.56 - 478.24] the water in they'll sit in a pool of
[476.40 - 480.24] water suck it in and then Purge it
[478.24 - 484.08] through their mouth and it's squeaky
[480.24 - 485.80] clean wow so colon health is very very
[484.08 - 488.08] important gut health becomes very
[485.80 - 490.00] important and doing your practices on an
[488.08 - 491.80] empty stomach becomes important because
[490.00 - 493.72] there is a certain ascendance of energy
[491.80 - 495.60] when you're doing your sadhana you will
[493.72 - 499.32] feel that as you become more sensitive
[495.60 - 502.16] and aware that the Energy starts moving
[499.32 - 504.32] upwards there is feces it's going to get
[502.16 - 506.48] blocked so this is why as a sports
[504.32 - 511.04] nutritionist I've always never been able
[506.48 - 513.44] to understand why yogic don't sip any
[511.04 - 516.08] sports drink or protein powder or
[513.44 - 518.20] anything before their yoga practice even
[516.08 - 520.20] though it's very intensive it's because
[518.20 - 522.56] that chakras or those energies come in
[520.20 - 524.64] from the essence of your core am I right
[522.56 - 526.16] in that they could come from the lower
[524.64 - 528.16] Dimensions we don't know what that
[526.16 - 530.64] Dimensions is that would be dependent on
[528.16 - 532.04] your state of evolution my CH my energy
[530.64 - 533.56] could start from here yours could start
[532.04 - 535.36] from here we don't know but the idea is
[533.56 - 536.48] that there is a certain upward movement
[535.36 - 538.32] and we don't want to rest and putting
[536.48 - 540.64] food in at that time kind of hinders
[538.32 - 543.16] hinders you from discovering in it or
[540.64 - 545.48] tapping into your best energy source and
[543.16 - 547.76] allowing it to move upward essentially
