Description: Call us on 9743430000. What you eat affects your immune system, your ability to concentrate, focus & recover too. To pull that trigger for a GOLD medal needs a calm & alert brain. Shooters should always AIM for a customized sports nutrition program which syncs their heart, blood & brain and enhance performance. The fundamental goals of training nutrition are to maintain attention, reduce physical and mental tiredness, and promote adaptation to maximise the advantages from time spent in the gym and on the range. Food not only nourishes muscle, but it also fuels the brain, which is necessary for range focus, talent, and attention. For shooting athletes, a nutrient-dense diet is essential. Including low-GI carbs, lean protein, and healthy fats in one's diet. Meals should be planned around training sessions to improve performance, appetite, and body composition. Snacks that are well-timed and portioned can help you avoid overeating later in the day. Prior to exercise, choose quality low-GI carbohydrate-based snacks with minimal amounts of protein to maximise energy required by the eyes, muscles, and brain for improved attention and stamina. Dehydration can make it difficult to focus and concentrate, as well as affect skill and coordination. During training and competition, shooters should drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. The amount of fluid required varies depending on the athlete's size and gender, as well as the weather. Because the fluid, carbohydrate, and electrolyte mix can boost fluid absorption from the gut, improve mental focus, and encourage fluid retention, sports drinks may be effective as part of a fluid plan during competitions.
It's critical to rehydrate after a race, especially if you're competing in numerous events on the same day. Shooting athletes must spend a whole day at the range during competition days. They must be organised and prepared for the full day with food and fluids — ideally, a self-packed cooler bag or esky. An ideal pre-competition meal should comprise low-GI carbohydrates to prime the body and brain, offer a steady release of energy, and prevent hazy vision or energy slumps, depending on the time of day before a round begins. The pre-competition meal should be something you're used to eating and won't irritate your stomach. Practicing with various food alternatives throughout training is a wonderful approach to figure out what the optimal pre-competition meal is for each person.

Transcript: everyone my name is right another you know sports nutritionist today I want to talk about shooting now covers nutrition a shooting related to each other wherein shooting in in your brain you definitely need your muscle because the other day I went to a shooting range and held a rifle for about half an hour and it's in that one position that you hold me lock your hips in a certain angle and you wear that suit and mind you're not it's really hot in that suit but let's start off with the shooters dial up us from a nutritional point of view now I don't know if you know this there are certain foods that you can eat alright and it will release your heart rate and there are certain foods that we need which will calm your heart rate now I know that sesame seeds actually lower blood pressure and calm your heart so when my shooters go I am representing them with the tills are do now son I know this sounds crazy but recently when I give one of my shooters still to do he said rights are very sticky and you know what happens is your equipment is there and also I have to think as a sports nutritionist what are the snacks of foods that I can give a shooter that one will help them obviously fuel the glucose because glucose are required for the brain but if you give too much of glucose then the break was to hyperactive if you give too little glucose which is the case with more sugar they don't eat for three four five six seven eight hours of practice then they are actually like physically present mentally absent so number one is the right levels of carbohydrate free shooting practice during shooting practice for shooting practice what you may not know is that the brain is phenomenally made up of water so when dehydration sets in your eyes are fully made up of also water your eyes dehydrated so the blink rate gets much more frequent so the chance of aiming properly and pressing the trigger at the right time microscopic fraction changes are there when your blink rate when your which is dehydrated is not processing now I know more shooting ranges are a condition but you know when you wear these suits in shooting they quite hot so you take the sweater off him one secret is the the shooters that come to me saying that you know what ran we don't want to do too much of hydration because when you do too much of hydration we'll to take off the suit to go to pee so you know you have to carefully balance to glucose and the water which is really really important okay and I want then figure out what are the other things that if sugar really requires okay when you want calmness you want your heart rate to be low now you can have a lower heart rate when you eat the right types of food in fact if your hydration you get dehydrated your heart rate goes up because the blood is now thicker so it needs more force to pump that blood so when your heart rate is higher your adrenaline is higher therefore your muscles are much more on trigger point do you know the Moto G they are more like vibration and they're not relaxed and calm so there are few things that you can do in shooting right from pumpkin seeds to walnuts walnuts have omega-3 DHA which works on the brain now I'm giving I'm throwing a few free tips out over here but a structured Olympic sports nutrition plan is so important for you to focus on if you want to get to the next level and don't start when you're shooting in the Nationals start when you're first picking up your rifle because if you don't eat correctly then you learn how to shoot correctly from a brain perspective a reaction time perspective and from a heart rate perspective in fact one of my shooters unjú we have seen certain foods are become really good I can remember I gave her a sports drink and she said no Ryan I don't feel so good with the glucose and the salt in it and then maybe changed it to a vitamin C she felt good now I thought I discovered something good like a vitamin C to another shooter he didn't work for another shooter so bio individuality of your nutrition plan in the shooting space is so so so important you know we do blood tests for our shooters now if you have a low b12 level or if you have a low calcium or low magnesium I don't know if you know this but catch'em magnesium sodium potassium are so important to put the muscle on put the muscle off its contraction relaxation now when there's a shortage of electrolytes that muscle remains another mode so you can never freely relax and shoot so a lot of kids don't know this but when we do blood tests we find out these nutritional deficiencies you know this so important to help we cannot get for example if you start putting on weight 3 4 5 6 kgs the body has this extra fat heart rate goes up your neighbor in a calm relaxed mode when you have your fat percentage up because your inflammation and some information is up your heart rate is up and you see a picture the heart rate goes up you're not to relax shoot it at the end of the day in fact it's to toes it's so important to time the meals you know or you have to have a discipline of getting up every day in the morning eating at the same times so that leads to let's say one day you eat breakfast at 9 o'clock what you to drop one day at 12 o clock you sugar levels are different amplitudes so if you kind of plan your meals correctly what committed you put in that meal for that family and what quantity you will have a level based sugar carbohydrate in which means you're thinking your heart rate is not going up and down in fact this is so important man once I worked with asado from the Yamada's he gave me the notion that they eat Willie want me in the day to stabilize their meditation and it was true food tends to aggravate because when you eat the food of the circulation from your course because Dhamma so your timing of your meal the quantity of what you put in is so important as a filter you literally heard of monk when you're a shooter but you have to eat from a sports nutrition perspective not a mom's perspective and these are things that we find out in fact I take an oximeter check the heart rate of my suitors to know whether they are agitated or not and I believe that our foods like beet food assess enhancer already said which can really know your heart rate but you know one size does not fit all so it's very important for you to realize what you need to be doing for example I had a case where once I had a shooter and three to five hours after eating a meal I wanted to check blood glucose levels see what what was that I said checked it and resting heart rate so when I give them Apple when they give them dried fruit when I gave them khichdi and when I gave them a sandwich in all three I had different heart rates and the one which has the lowest heart rate was the Apple now would you eat an apple I don't know whether you like an apple or not but the point is I'm not making an apple hero because when I changed an apple to a banana I got a different result what you have to do is over a one-year period find the perfect foods for you to be come the perfect gone shooter once you do that you then have consistency like how you know you bought your gun is a consistency in the weight of the gun is the consistency in the ammunition from where you buy it and how you should because you believe so much an equipment what about the equipment that you need to put into your body which is the food there has to be able and a good sports nutritionist will help you Manny the choices of food and the regimes of your training bring them
