[8.16 - 13.28] founder of blueprint spends his money to
[10.68 - 15.48] reverse his age till now many people
[13.28 - 18.40] think that you can only age and get
[15.48 - 22.08] older and not any younger well there are
[18.40 - 24.60] two types of age one is your normal age
[22.08 - 26.56] you may be 20 or 30 years it's the
[24.60 - 29.24] number of years that you are on this
[26.56 - 32.80] planet and then there is your biological
[29.24 - 35.40] age the age of your body you can be 20
[32.80 - 38.80] years old but your biological age can be
[35.40 - 41.56] more 30 or even 40 your biological age
[38.80 - 44.04] and your normal age is not the same
[41.56 - 46.84] however your biological age is
[44.04 - 48.96] reversible I have successfully reversed
[46.84 - 51.40] the biological age of my billionaire
[48.96 - 55.24] clients by over 10 years yes it's
[51.40 - 56.80] possible Ryan in this case eats a strict
[55.24 - 59.92] diet of
[56.80 - 62.16] 2,250 calories per day in a 6h hour p
[59.92 - 65.68] period which she combines with a 1hour
[62.16 - 68.96] exercise regime 111 supplements daily a
[65.68 - 71.40] rigid bedtime routine blood transfusions
[68.96 - 73.80] and daily Health test among other things
[71.40 - 76.40] in the hopes of achieving the equivalent
[73.80 - 78.56] of an 18-year-old physique now let's
[76.40 - 81.88] understand the science behind this first
[78.56 - 84.68] we have telr and cellular aging the size
[81.88 - 87.20] of the telome determines the Aging rate
[84.68 - 90.04] the shorter the tel the more older your
[87.20 - 93.52] body is the second one is your EP
[90.04 - 95.84] genetic modifications epigenetic changes
[93.52 - 98.00] the alterations in gene Expressions
[95.84 - 100.20] without changing the underlining DNA
[98.00 - 102.08] sequence playing a role in aging here at
[100.20 - 104.32] the Quan nutrition clinics we do genetic
[102.08 - 106.72] testings which shows if our clients are
[104.32 - 109.24] more prone to these changes few of the
[106.72 - 112.36] tips that you can do to follow a healthy
[109.24 - 114.64] diet an organic plant-based diet rich in
[112.36 - 116.84] fruits vegetables and whole grains May
[114.64 - 119.32] positively influence epigenetic
[116.84 - 121.88] modifications having nonv only if you
[119.32 - 123.40] can source organic non veg products is a
[121.88 - 125.92] good idea most of the products in the
[123.40 - 128.08] market today are genetically modified or
[125.92 - 130.04] injected with chemicals and hormones to
[128.08 - 132.56] give you bigger e this may not be good
[130.04 - 134.76] for your age some studies now are also
[132.56 - 138.00] suggesting can you go into intermittent
[134.76 - 140.08] fasting which can impact gene expression
[138.00 - 142.44] related to longevity intermittent
[140.08 - 144.84] fasting lets the body Channel its energy
[142.44 - 146.44] towards healing and repairing all the
[144.84 - 148.92] damaged parts of its body there's
[146.44 - 151.32] another person in the age Revolution
[148.92 - 153.60] David Sinclair my mentor Harvard
[151.32 - 155.76] Professor australian-american biologist
[153.60 - 157.96] and academic known for his research on
[155.76 - 159.84] aging and epigenetics these longevity
[157.96 - 162.16] genes we work on are turned on by
[159.84 - 164.60] fasting one of the key ways in which
[162.16 - 167.48] intermittent fasting May promote good
[164.60 - 170.56] health is by activating a process known
[167.48 - 173.20] as Auto Fiji Auto Fiji is a body's
[170.56 - 175.28] mechanism for recycling old or damaged
[173.20 - 178.04] cells and has been linked with many
[175.28 - 180.68] health benefits including increased
[178.04 - 182.72] lifespan and protection against diseases
[180.68 - 185.84] like cancer now what are Dr David
[182.72 - 189.04] Sinclair's eating patterns a plantbased
[185.84 - 191.36] diet he skips breakfast Stakes a small
[189.04 - 193.84] amount of olive oil or yogurt with his
[191.36 - 196.76] supplements drinks a lot of water
[193.84 - 199.28] consumes very low sugar and starchy
[196.76 - 201.04] Foods prioritize your nutrition is what
[199.28 - 203.52] these billionaire and doctors are
[201.04 - 206.04] talking about you are what you eat your

[214.24 - 218.44] know what is right for the body and
[216.24 - 220.56] therefore my years of practice tell me
[218.44 - 223.36] that the best results are obtained when
[220.56 - 225.04] we follow a tailor made customized diet
[223.36 - 227.32] that fits into our lifestyle our
[225.04 - 230.04] genetics and we understand what is right
[227.32 - 232.64] and what is wrong for our body consider
[230.04 - 235.36] incorporating foods with proven
[232.64 - 237.96] anti-aging properties my favorites
[235.36 - 241.24] blueberries geric which contains cumin
[237.96 - 244.48] really powerful broccoli sulfine it's
[241.24 - 247.00] anti-cancer anti-aging Tomatoes lopine
[244.48 - 250.16] boost lung function amazing for the skin
[247.00 - 252.04] my alltime favorite butterhead lettuce
[250.16 - 254.28] high levels of nitric oxide even more
[252.04 - 256.68] than that of beetroot pomegranates
[254.28 - 258.24] contains beta sterol which is a block
[256.68 - 260.68] cleaner keeps your arteries clean

[276.00 - 281.40] including my own self now another thing
[278.28 - 283.96] is I'd like you to also do exercise a
[281.40 - 286.12] mix of cardiovascular strength training
[283.96 - 289.52] and flexibility exercises because as we
[286.12 - 292.40] age we lose muscle therefore if we do
[289.52 - 295.52] exercise we can rebuild our muscle and
[292.40 - 298.96] maintain it so that we can overcome this
[295.52 - 302.32] age related muscle loss another thing to

[311.56 - 316.84] important as many important detox and
[314.36 - 319.40] repair processes happen whilst we sleep
[316.84 - 321.96] a good sleep a deep sleep coupled with
[319.40 - 324.32] fasting is the Perfect combo for a great

[331.16 - 334.60] routine before you get to bed to enhance
[332.92 - 337.36] your sleep quality is the name of the
[334.60 - 339.56] game sleep at the same time every day
[337.36 - 343.44] foods that help you sleep better are a
[339.56 - 345.84] 55% carbohydrate based meal 2 to 3 hours
[343.44 - 348.52] before sleeping ensure that this food
[345.84 - 350.68] includes complex carbohydrates good fats
[348.52 - 353.32] melatonin rich foods half a bowl of
[350.68 - 356.28] chickpeas four walnuts 2 to three tar
[353.32 - 359.52] cherries or maybe even 10 pistachios an
[356.28 - 361.96] hour before bedtime are potent melatonin
[359.52 - 364.28] sleep natural pills other foods that
[361.96 - 366.60] help sleep better chamomile tea my
[364.28 - 369.00] favorite healthy milk and the other
[366.60 - 371.16] things that you can do is smell lavender
[369.00 - 374.96] lavender is known to be calming keep
[371.16 - 378.04] your room dark keep your phone away far
[374.96 - 380.12] away not next to you and stop all blue
[378.04 - 382.92] lights from technology 2 hours before
[380.12 - 384.96] bet and consider now supplements I
[382.92 - 387.08] advise supplements only if they're
[384.96 - 388.56] necessary as these vitamins and minerals
[387.08 - 390.56] can be obtained from the food and the
[388.56 - 393.04] surroundings your job is to consult a
[390.56 - 394.76] nutritionist or your doctor before
[393.04 - 396.80] incorporating supplements into your
[394.76 - 399.08] lifestyle they are beneficial but
[396.80 - 400.44] remember supplements are a nutritional
[399.08 - 402.24] convenience for your nutritional
[400.44 - 405.04] indiscipline so first get nutritionally
[402.24 - 407.28] disciplined then turn to supplements by
[405.04 - 408.84] the way one of my favorites is omega-3
[407.28 - 411.12] fatty acids to maintain the cell
[408.84 - 414.48] membrane integrity and brain function
[411.12 - 417.00] 60% of the brain is fat and of that 50%
[414.48 - 419.24] is omega-3 in fact in my clinic I do an
[417.00 - 421.00] omega-3 pin prick blood test reach out
[419.24 - 423.12] to to me to get that blood test done
[421.00 - 426.16] it's a crystal ball gazing into your
[423.12 - 428.36] future in the age Revolution vitamin D
[426.16 - 430.40] will become the four most runner in
[428.36 - 431.96] anti-aging let's face it all of us are
[430.40 - 433.32] deficient in vitamin D all the thousands
[431.96 - 434.88] of blood tests have done at the Quan
[433.32 - 436.72] Clinic come back testing with low
[434.88 - 439.16] vitamin D level so please do test
[436.72 - 440.80] yourself the link is in my bio to get a
[439.16 - 442.68] blood test take a supplement under
[440.80 - 445.60] nutritional advice or doctor's
[442.68 - 448.32] supervision and vitamin D is crucial in
[445.60 - 450.20] testosterone function and burning of fat
[448.32 - 452.20] in your body another another great
[450.20 - 453.88] nutritional supplement that I love is
[452.20 - 456.24] collagen after you've crossed a certain
[453.88 - 457.96] age your body produces lesser collagen
[456.24 - 459.40] and therefore your skin starts to Sag
[457.96 - 461.56] and become wrinkled so maybe
[459.40 - 465.64] supplementation with collagen is an
[461.56 - 467.96] amazing anti-aging Feelgood Factor now
[465.64 - 469.64] another medical breakthrough product
[467.96 - 471.60] being prescribed by doctors in the west
[469.64 - 473.48] is rapamycin I don't advise you to take
[471.60 - 475.04] this without medical advice but it's
[473.48 - 477.12] considered one of the most powerful
[475.04 - 478.80] drugs in longevity and it's been
[477.12 - 480.36] researched extensively in terms of
[478.80 - 482.92] extending life lify so if you have any
[480.36 - 485.88] interest research up Romy and talk to
[482.92 - 489.36] your nutritionist or your medical doctor
[485.88 - 491.68] now Beyond supplements Beyond diet
[489.36 - 494.00] Beyond food Beyond exercise is its
[491.68 - 495.84] important for Stress Management include
[494.00 - 498.40] techniques such as meditation deep
[495.84 - 501.68] breathing or yoga because when you lower
[498.40 - 504.16] your stress levels your body ages slower
[501.68 - 506.72] consider mindful practices to reduce the
[504.16 - 509.76] impact of chronic stresses stress is a
[506.72 - 512.12] silent killer many diseases or originate
[509.76 - 513.76] in the human body when it is stressed
[512.12 - 515.64] this is because of the high cortisol
[513.76 - 517.44] level which is a stress hormone and many
[515.64 - 519.76] imbalances are created in fact Pot
[517.44 - 521.64] Bellies are a result of high cortisol
[519.76 - 523.68] levels so you're stressed out and the
[521.64 - 526.24] pot belly is making you older now if
[523.68 - 528.32] stress is chronic this imbalance rakes
[526.24 - 530.20] havoc in our system we do not want
[528.32 - 532.08] distress anywhere next to us and
[530.20 - 534.60] therefore it's important to understand
[532.08 - 537.16] what would distress Us in stressful
[534.60 - 538.92] situations be aware in okav Japan they
[537.16 - 540.64] have something called the Blue Zone
[538.92 - 543.12] where they have Community Building
[540.64 - 545.08] programs we humans are social creatures
[543.12 - 547.24] we cannot live in isolation and it takes
[545.08 - 549.64] a bad tot on the body in this age of
[547.24 - 552.16] social media everyone is well connected
[549.64 - 554.40] but people are more isolated than ever
[552.16 - 556.64] ironic isn't it you can have many close
[554.40 - 559.80] friends online but the friends that you
[556.64 - 562.08] have offline to physically interact with
[559.80 - 564.52] you are the difference markers
[562.08 - 566.40] maintaining strong social connections
[564.52 - 569.44] like they do in Japan where they live to
[566.40 - 572.60] 100 years plus call the Blue zone is a
[569.44 - 575.08] secret to a longer life and a healthier
[572.60 - 577.16] life engage in activities interact with
[575.08 - 579.12] family members and friends that will
[577.16 - 582.36] bring joy and fulfillment to you every

[645.60 - 648.60] younger
