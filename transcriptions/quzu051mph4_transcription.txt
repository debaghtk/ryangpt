Transcript: the boat shops thank you so much hi everyone good morning [Applause] you know 20 years ago I was 25 years ago as one of your students in the back over there probably not as smart as all of you in this room today uh I studied at Goa Medical College which is one of the oldest medical colleges in Asia I did a masters in clinical biochemistry and I was listening to all the doctors here and the future doctors that you are going to become and I run a very successful nutritional practice and I get very embarrassed when all of those accolades go up because uh I'm driven by changing people's lives and social you as a medical expert you have to understand that this subject matter that you are going to specialize in whatever you do you don't realize it but you're sitting in those benches today the people in the front over here are your teachers you expect the teachers to teach you I throw the ball in your court what are you doing to learn better because it is you who are investing in yourself so without any further Ado yeah this is all of my clients have I've probably worked with some of the best people on the planet because they believe that their body is the best now as a medical doctor thank you as a medical doctor the question is whatever your field of medicine be it Dermatology Internal Medicine Cardiology neurology whatever it is whatever you specialize I request you to take one thing away for the future while science drives all of us to have a very focused view like a microscope remember sometimes you have to take your eye out of the microscope and look at the world around you I know this because I have a few doctors on my team and the focus is so ingrained that you're not willing to step back from your education and ask questions so today my subject is not about me being an expert I'm only here to open your eyes about good nutrition and I thank Dr Jonas because I'm going to take his contact because I want to work with him now why do I want to work with him he pointed out four or five things on genetics and nutrition so whoever you work with get to the next level okay by the way if you want this presentation uh that's a QR code scan over there so if all the youngsters in the audience your QRS can code that on Instagram you message me I will send you the entire presentation this is what I do and my presentation has been designed not to give you the scientific study but point you in the right direction and each point is hyperlinked to a scientific study which I expect you to do your reading if it interests you okay so let's get started [Music] okay sorry so if you read this I'm going to turn around and read it with you Thomas Edison it was an inventor the doctor the future will give no more medicine but interest is patient in the care of the human frame in the diet in the cause and prevention of disease this is 1903. okay how many of you have heard of chat GPT we're in 2023 you've heard of it how many of you have used it now I ask yourself this question start thinking as medical students you have company you have brain you got to put stuff in here you got Google you've got chat GPT what are you going to become in the future artificial intelligence Among Us why is this guy going he's supposed to talk about nutrition in the brain I'm asking you to start activating your brain the first part is using your brain who will you become and I always start my lectures not about the subject matter but how is it going to influence your future you guys are doing brain research you're changing lives of people what do you do you change people's lives students what are you going to do talk to admin what are you going to do ma'am what are you going to do we change people's lives in some small way and if I can inspire you on one thing I I've probably trained around six seven thousand medical professionals because I am a good nutritionist the one thing that I see in people is greatness when they practice not on subject matter expertise but on human connect please understand the brain is what we are talking about today you will get older and in your own body frame as you get older your science is going to be ancient what I learned in 1996 in Goa Medical College going to the library and all of you have about 45 years of age will understand what this means in the library the youngsters here do not know what that means all the youngsters here are this so you've got to know that your patient bedside manner is the most important thing and the dean of Goa Medical College used to be my mentor and she says Ryan when the patient walks in don't be stuck in your notes look at the patient walking in that will give you all the signs in 30 seconds if you're a great practitioner so don't be stuck in your notes when a patient walks in when you walk into the room and I'm sure Dr arvind does this all the time when he walks into that room he's looking at the patient talking the patient understanding it's where the brain first starts from your brain to your patient's brain okay so let me start with the most important system you all guys and medical guys know that these are all the systems in the human body my perspective to you is clinical biochemistry yes brain performance Dr Jonas went into some things and he touched upon a little bit of what I'm going to talk about this is stuff that cause nightmares for me I don't know if you get nightmares memorizing this for your biochemistry paper I have some I have some solids to offer you don't worry okay you may be bottom of your class the important thing is to understand what you are studying don't try and memorize it because 30 years later you will not remember it but it's important to know what citrate does in a PCA cycle or what is the measure of Diagnostics in the biochemistry which will help you ask for a test and interpret it tomorrow forget about memorization the world is changing I know I might be short today for saying this in a in a teaching college but the word is going to change and so you're gonna have to rely more on your bedside Manner and your ability to join the dots remember this statement ability to join the dots is very important so I want to start my lecture about sharing something in your own life so that you'll remember this lecture there's something known as how quickly do cells differentiate in your body okay and if I can step up over here without doing this can you see over here let's take white blood cells two to five days what is this stem cells two months bone osteoblast three months liver hepatocytes five years what is this one so the reason people's brains go bad is because they're not taking care of their health simple yes it's genetics I know but then doctor also mentioned something called as epigenetics what is epigenetics the environment on your body now if you understand that fat cells are replaced every eight years all other parts of your body replace within two three months so as a nutritionist when I change the raw material that goes into your body if the raw material is correct to all the uh all the plus 40 people who have built your own house over here right when you build your own house either you're buying a flat when you're negotiating with the builder you're going like what tile did you use what window did you use because you're going to live in that house for the next 20 30 years those of you are youngsters when you buy clothing most of you look at the brand when you're young you don't look at the quality of the brand so I want you to understand this one thing that if the turnover rate as of the human body you're a doctor that means you're constantly reconstructing ourselves what is the number one thing that your patient needs to focus on think about it the raw material that goes into the human body and I I I don't know about how many of you but I get very stressed out practicing a lot I've got film stars I've got celebrities I've got a 75 member dietitian team they give me a lot of gray hair I love to Garden ing gives me one perception in science if my plants are fed correctly I talk to my plants I play music to my plants they don't die in eight years they're with me for 16 years instead of eight years what I'm trying to communicate to you is epigenetics okay so anyone knows where this is in Bangalore yeah UB City most expensive real estate most expensive real estate what's the statement over here and I know this is a CMA but I want to inspire you to take care of your health first because in taking care of your health first you will become the best practitioner in life because your body is number one and you learn from that perspective your body is the most expensive real estate in the world think about it doctors I may come in here in a luxury vehicle I will change that in five years you will buy a beautiful house you will change it maybe in 10 years because you got a nice pension bonus PF whatever but can you change the human body I could go to Dr Jonas and say Here's One Core rupees can you change my brain no so we are understanding how either somebody who's sick has come to us or somebody who is going to break time would you agree with me that in the human body this is the most uh important real estate the brain the gastroes will be saying no no no no it is the digestive system because if we shut up the whole body stops Okay so having said this these are the general statements that you want to look at your brain is your best asset nurture it balanced diet quality blah blah blah blah now as medical students you'll be like this is not scientific I request you whilst you are getting trained in extreme scientific knowledge also practice with your patients common sense I've interviewed half a dozen doctors last year to hire them into my company common sense is lacking because when you meet with a patient patient doesn't understand scientific study patient understands Common Sense coming out of your mouth so communicate with common sense communicate with science with your peers in this room which is why after this if you ask me any questions I know nothing I will go to my chat GPS and say oh yes this student asked me this please give me the answer it's very important to understand this so I follow Dr Daniel Amen on the internet and he speaks a lot of logic and there was a scam many years ago that I saw in terms of the brain scan okay so this is the healthy scan of a patient from the top down and from the underside and this is when there is abuse 10 years of alcohol cocaine okay it's smoking so it got me thinking one is I come here for a lecture today okay and I come with flowers so I come with nutrition I come with protein carbs omega-3 ginkgo biloba phosphorylene phosphorylcholine on the other hand Lati alcohol um what else what could what else could be negative smoking alcohol smoking this is common what else would mental stress play a crucial role right so whilst we say hey we can do games and stuff like that and train the mind and Sudoku and you know play with the brain and stimulate the brain there's also a negative to that so when I see people coming to my nutritional clinic now I have a very privileged practice you being in a teaching college you will cater to all segments of society so it's important to have your demographic open for extremely poor people and extremely rich people so your thinking has to accordingly be the Sherlock Holmes I hope you all know who Sherlock Holmes is okay I thought I was too old in the junction few people have said they know who Sherlock Holmes is the brain ages okay so with the hods of all your departments and me now we need to start doing our Dr Jonas we need to start doing more silico puzzles and take more omega-3 with your permission because at around 45 is when our decline starts hey you youngsters behind if you smoke if you drink and you party late and get lit less than eight hours of sleep there are already sleep studies showing correct me if I'm wrong sleep deprivation causes brain vascularity to drop I know this because I need to make Virat Kohli score centuries can it benefit run faster and I have half a dozen chess Champions with me now I don't have the privilege in my clinic to do the scans the simplest thing we do is we track their sleep and we track their heart rate the lower their heart rate the more relaxed they are the the better their sleep is the faster they perform and we see that VO2 max and all so when I do that with the sports person when um Vijay shekhar Sharma paytm comes in or um tiwari of inmobi comes in they are also can I make my brain better can I make my body better because you can't change this body so please understand you will get lifestyle people coming to you and you those are called vain people so if I come to you I'm like hey tell me how my brain can be better I don't have a problem that's vanity and then you have pain people who comes to you dementia Alzheimer's Parkinson's so as Doctor you need to see both ends of the spectrum but yes the diseases do accelerate your your brain uh drop and I was so happy that you mentioned the apoe 4G and I thought nobody would have talked about this so eyes do a lot of speaking and recently I was asked to talk about omega-3 at another symposium now whilst many in the medical community will say there's not significant proof I am going to spin your head slightly how much of scientific proof do you need to do before you prescribe a better diet it's common sense if there are molecules that improve my question back to you is what is the harm of giving omega-3 so where you need to go into deep dark I I try to make this from the scientific study as easy to understand as possible okay so Alzheimer's disease the apoe 14 this is a cholesterol management Gene so you have apoe one e one two three four so just imagine this Gene the four guy if you four controls how your cholesterol management happens and what they found out in this study was when they gives nutrition DHA DHA supplement was given they found that the apoe non-carriers absorbed it but the apo4 carriers they did not absorb it now as a nutritionist I was like Hey I want to prescribe a nutritional supplement so if everyone comes to my clinic and we have not done the apio gene as Ryan Fernando I'm giving them an Omega supplement but it's not helping out but what I further read in the study what I further read in the study was phosphorylated DHA do you know why phospholated DHA comes from fish so now I'm now I'm stuck with a gun between my head do I give fish oil supplement or do I give natural fish in the diet so medicine genetics have taken me to the next level to say could I do the genetic screening and by the way I don't do this for Alzheimer's patients anybody who comes in is asking me they want to become like Virat Kohli they want to be sharp they want to be strong they want to be fit all of us want to become Virat kohli's in our lives yes or no right so then would you take a fish oil supplement or would you take Natural fish now you know the vegetarians in the audience will say I'm vegetarian there's an answer for that there's vegan DHA also available extracted from CV because for your general knowledge the fish in the ocean eat the phytoplankton and the seaweed so the fish do not get omega-3 from them they get it from the ocean from the vegetarian sauce in the ocean now manufacturers manufacture vegan DHA so this was this was one of my favorite studies to share with the medical community DHA makes up the most amount of Omega-3 in the brain now sixty percent of the brain is fat and when I when normally I meet doctors everyone says there's not enough of scientific data to prove that maybe omega-3 supplementation will help we need further studies I just have one thing to all the medical students think number one number two the world is now understanding the bio individuality of the human race I am gluten DNA sensitive my brother is not how do you explain that between two individuals in the same family so the bio individuality is going to make your medicine more personalized in the future so the perspective over here is if 60 percent of the brain is made up of fat I have a thought to everybody in this Auditorium last year the government dropped the import Duty on palm oil do you know why there's a shortage of cooking oil in the country so prices cannot go up it's a correct move because the common am aadmi needs oil to cook and we cannot have expensive oil that you and I have in our kitchen but palm oil is saturated palmitic acid 60 of my brain is made up of fat what's happening to the dietary changes in our planet sorry in our country I'm only giving this as food of thought as a doctor please join the dots why is there more depression why is there more anxiety senior lecturers you and I never ate outside I got 10 Rupees pocket money do you remember the time we could not eat out eating out was once a month mama and papa took us out to such a happy thing today what's happening to you youngsters every meal is in a cafe coffee day Shanti Sagar this Sagar that Sagar sixty percent brain fat dietary source fat I rest my case I hope you all start eating a little healthier in yes I have seen personalized by individual cases which is why I make a shitload of money because people come to me and I'm not like there's not conclusive proof that omega-3 works you know what I think I need to use to eat fish oh I can't eat fish Ryan sir okay we're going to give you a vegan omega-3 how do I know it works there is a diagnostic test a fingerprint blood test I don't know if you know this I've been invited today by your hod of biochemistry so you better be good in Biochemistry the blood test test the omega-3 and omega-6 levels in your blood a simple 2400 rupee pinprint blood test which my prediction is in five years time it will be 50 rupees omega-6 to omega-3 omega-6 is inflammatory omega-3 is non-inflammatory right so if you come to know that a patient has a ratio the correct ratio is three is to one omega-6 is to omega-3 do you know when I did my test what was my ratio 33 is to one do you know what was my son's ratio 133 is to 1. and teachers were complaining he's not paying attention in school his brain his father big short nutritionist thinks he's feeding him correct but father is not there the whole day to see that what chips he's eating what junk food he's eating what servants are giving him and so then I was like open your mouth every morning fish oil give it to him in two weeks the teacher called me up Sir icon is an angel three months later tested it it's come down to 17 is to one the brain needs nutrition our diet is love and culture not scientific medicine is scientific diet is not scientific could you as doctors make diet scientific that is my sincere request to you so don't shoot down a nutritional supplement don't shoot down a molecule already found in the body which is DHA and EPA are things that can affect you do you know what is acrylamide microwave your food eat food that has been fired Beyond 180 degree celsius a toxic chemical is produced from the carbohydrates right you know which one food has the highest acrylamide we all eat it even I love it it's long slim yeah french fries you're better off eating potatoes but the ones which are commercially fried they heat it at very high temperature so if you have an air fryer keep your airfryer under 160 degrees Celsius not above that refined carbs alcohol glycation fish High aspartame I will watching the internet on aspartame how many of you all know Aspartame is going to be banned by who raise your hand dudes you guys need to get in with the times I'm telling you something okay I'm going to share this frankly with you you may practice in a college today but artificial intelligence tomorrow will be given by Google and everyone to the rest of the world do you think patients are going to turn up to doctors then it's only when they're dying you want to enter the field of being aware about what molecules your patients put into their body so please get aware you don't have to go to the library and do this it's there on your phone so everyone I've given you my presentation as a scan so each one of these links are clickable okay so if you click on this I've given the scientific study on ginkgo biloba phosphorylcholine phosphate with city now let me share you with with you the Virat Kohli story actually not Virat Kohli somebody else phosphatidyls I have to remember now I'm not as good as you guys I think it's phosphatidyl serine 30 grams is the raw material source of phosphoryl serine in the brain right do you think a diet contains enough of phospholidated serine the four which is the foods which contain phosphoryl serine soy pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds and egg yolk average intake of 100 grams of the seeds provides 130 milligrams a day in your turnover rate as a medical college student or a professor sitting over here do you think you get enough of raw material source of phosphorylated serine and phosphorylcholine in your diet keeping in mind the farming practices in our country are chemically driven with pesticides and insecticides so organic is better but how many of us in this room eat organic my case in point to the medical community is look at the ingredients found in nature and in the human body and could you biohack individually the prescription to your patient using data whether the scientific studies are there on how it is so to give you in the cricket thing IPL you're playing playing there was a study on phosphatidylcholine levels in Boston marathon runners so they measure the Boston Marathon as Runners running running running immediately after the marathon there's a 40 drop in phosphatidylcholine levels then they ask them to do the brain games that Dr Jonas was talking about and they found out that the brain couldn't work phosphorylcholine levels went down I read this study and I was like hang on IPL that back back two days later another one bad bad so by the time five six games are gone the brain is 14th any of you medical students get brain fatigue you can't afford it but what if you could biohack your diet what if you could buy or hack your diet do not choose the wrong molecules and to find out where your phosphorylated choline and phosphorylating person by the way I'd be very interested to know if in India where testing in the blood chemistry for levels of phosphoridal selenium phosphorylcholine I don't know but I would love for someone to share with that me on Instagram um you've heard of Resveratrol right so people talked about you know this Mediterranean group of people Sicily and all they were drinking glasses of wine and you would have heard it and then your your friends and all hey Dr arment so we can drink three glasses of wine no and he's like but India we don't drink wine right but the study was done on Resveratrol in mice and they found it in anti-aging and stuff like that so for me where you talked about the Tau proteins and the beta amyloid as a nutritionist I only hear beta amyloid I know it is some garbage on the brain that is being formed okay Resveratrol in the study says it interferes with the formation of this ho as Ryan Fernando can I prescribe a glass of wine no no Dr Jonas will say you can't give alcohol alcohol shrinks the brain so what do we do who is the hero Resveratrol how do you think you can get Resveratrol grapes now the next problem is I start prescribing grapes people will start eating too much of grapes too much of sugar are we promoting a more fat gain diabetic version so nutritional supplementation with resveratrol have you heard of a Doctor by the name of Dr David Sinclair he's the father of uh claims to be the father of anti-aging Dr David Sinclair I follow him proof is in the pudding of watching his picture he's 53 years old he looks under 35 years of age so he's done the research on the Resveratrol and rats and all watch his online watch his online talks for two three hours you'll get information on respiratory by the way everyone I'm hyperlinked all the studies for you so the science part which I'm not really good at you can get it I read the science part and like how can I give this to Anushka Sharma if I give this to Anushka Sharma she will have good brain power to memorize her lines of the movie Yes because she came and asked me can I drink three two three glasses of wine or somebody else comes and asked me can I drink one everybody asks me but I don't want to give wine as a nutritionist I want to give respiratory so keep these points in your head so we all know that it's required for cognitive function brain development you are all speed readers are any medical college student can read very fast read fast again it's underlined because it's hyperlinked to the study that you want to discover I want to share few things anxiety and depression uh drug users they gave them three grams of Omega-3 and in three months there was a significant decrease in the symptoms study again if you see bottom here I've clicked for you to access the study and read it uh very interesting anxiety and depression is going through the roof across sometimes you know um you'll hear on the news so and so patient suffered from depression and committed suicide and all and sometimes I've got a very loose tongue so please forgive me for it so I'm reading a newspaper and I'm like looking and then I'm like look at my wife like yeah this fellow committed suicide vitamin B12 deficiency omega-3 deficiency if you had taken this you would have been better my wife's like how can you be so insensitive but I would request you as a medical community when people are showing anxiety and depression just look at their diet look at their diet some of the solutions have become the Sherlock Holm prison study they did it to save costs to house a prisoner in Australia was nearly twenty thousand dollars per prisoner but the cost of Omega-3 supplementation was one thousand dollars they found out if they gave them omega-3 supplementation they could use reduce the prison sentence because of good behavior because of the omega-3 supplementation now people say it's not systematic peer review this review that review I'm like if my dad is going through depression and anxiety Papa omega-3 now I'm looking which is the best Omega-3 natural source right and the studies again are over here I'm going a little bit fast because I don't want to waste on the next scientific speakers time you don't remember me remember this slide for your medical practice please take down notes on this one hemp seeds one nut you you want to spend money on a great shirt buy a lesser shot so I spend more money on my diet and my trainers than the Emi for a luxury vehicle the human body is the most expensive real estate spend on your body and the nutrition so walnuts are expensive but research has shown the omega-3 contended walnuts is better than a fish oil capsule so you can get the 100 RDA from chia seeds hemp seeds I've forgotten to add one over here very famous in India under the name of methi flax seeds is amazing if your gut can tolerate it okay can so how many of y'all are non-vegetarian in this audience okay for the non-vegetarian audience can you tell me which fish has the highest Omega-3 keep looking mackerel is known as a poor man's fish salmon is known as the VIP Superstars fish my father told me Ryan please do not publicize this on the internet in Goa you will make mackerel become the most expensive fish okay so I am asking you to look in your clinical practice tomorrow in your hospital if the possibility is not vegetarian can mackerel be one of the fish sources for it's like 100 grams of fish will give you nearly 10 grams of Omega-3 that's massive I have put people who have come to my clinic who are old and rich on the correct mackerel or salmon and in three months Elixir my skin is glowing my sex performance is better at 82. can you imagine an 82 year old telling you telling you his sex performance is better because of fish okay this is the this is the key slide which I would love to give you the the medical community uh I have linked every food with a scientific study um so can better can you just show the link of the study so for example pomegranates neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease which are mediated by urolithins Euro lithons have been studied Now by doctors as the anti-aging molecule where do you get urolithins you are known to prescribe a drug 800 grams of pomegranate with the seed every day I know I'm being very passionate about this because the the medicine is in our food the medicine is enough food can you go back so all the secrets I am hoping somebody over here becomes a doctor of nutrition I sincerely do hope in the future you become a doctor of nutrition this is the key where I make a lot of money Dr Jonas this is my slide I want to wet it with you he'll give me more he will be give me more fuel to get it even better because when I have the clinical symptoms with a simple questionnaire or a blood test this is what we get this is the Indian RDA most of you know about the RDA which is the recommended dietary allowance I'm coming to the last slide I was supposed to do a neuroplastic exercise I don't think I'm an expert to do that but I was just looking up the internet and apparently you go one hand like this you go one hand like this can you do this with me so so one hand your one hand here okay interlock your fingers okay and then bring it in like this Now command your brain to move any one finger and see if you can make the free say oh man I can't move that finger have you noticed you're moving another finger your brain can be rewired your brain can be rewired so as medical doctors yeah as medical doctors you can learn a lot about everything that you do I'll take questions now my final slide you are what you eat right God bless you all and I hope you have a very successful career can you put the first Slide the first light no questions mean you are great students yes you have a question thank you what about the river fishes So based on my limited knowledge I am not able to I'm not able to find out a source of I'm not able to find out a source of river fish in any data saying how much of Omega-3 has and my logic says any fish that has omega-3 or smells when you fry it so your salmon and natural which are sea fish smell more uh so beta I don't have an answer for you but if you can find it on the internet I have not been able to find the omega-3 content in river fish see I get this question about mercury poisoning beta we live in India it is heavy metal so how I solve this issue is as all the biochemistry students here know there is something known as the minerals heavy metal blood test all my very rich clients I subject them to that test in the history of my practice of 6000 clients only one patient who lived in a mining area had high mercury levels so I I don't think I should go in the direction where literature is saying fish has heavy has mockery you can test for it if you are aware because now I'll put this in front of you you're supposed to take RDA for omega-3 it can come via fish mackerel no no no don't eat mackerel it's got Mercury but you have not done the diagnostic test for mercury so with the assumption that your fish could be tender now I'll throw the question back to you as a medical doctor why are you prescribing a drug drug a side effect no you understand as a doctor the pros and the cons as a doctor as in so when you get into nutrition understand the pros of vegetarian sauce non-vegetarian social protein then what is the Omega in that and what is Omega naught in that that is how I look at it in my practice okay we can have electricity yes yes very very good answer so for those who are vegetarian vegan you get vegan omega-3 you can have chia seed you can have flax seed you can have hemp seed you can have Walnut and a lot of compounds in nature will have some tiny amount of Omega-3 which is why we say balanced diet just has a question I mean garlic we have seen that the the active compound that we look at is allicin found in garlic now Allison has got tremendous properties in terms of the Ros the free radical damage that happens so there are no individual papers with enough of data but when we give garlic atherosclerosis goes gets improved so if you've seen ancient ayurveda practice garlic has been part of the diet as a prescription what I recommend to people is when you take garlic you need to smash it you need to let it oxidize and then put it into your food the only side effect of garlic is more than two or three PODS of garlic a day for good microbiome for clearer arteries I don't have any scientific studies on brain and garlic or maybe I have not read it is that your sweat begins to smell after four weeks so that's the only side effect of garlic but yes garlic is also a blood thinner so it helps in that department any other questions otherwise can I hand it over yes doctor yes today and also do you approve synthetic proteins or synthetic supplements apart from all this but you learned that from the you know dietary allowance okay so so so doctor the the question the Doctor's first question is what is a balanced diet if you take the premise of a bio individual person genetically in nutrigenomics which is the science of studying how your food interacts with the genetics in the body there are certain people labeled to be better receptors for a higher protein diet and certain people with a higher carbohydrate diet will never put on weight so if I take the bio individual strategy that I use the balanced diet is different from person to person however assuming that we are in a teaching Medical College and the demographic of people coming in cannot do this bio individuality my advice is this our ancestors ate this much of rice this much of protein Dal pulses legumes and this much of subzi all people today have sedentary lives all including poor people so you need to turn the pyramid on its head sabzi needs to become this much pulses and Dal needs to become this much and green grain all the grain which is rice wheat jovar Bali Millet which was designed for manual labor so how many of us are doing manual labor we don't need that much of grain so we need this much of grain I think that is a balanced diet in today's day and age where the subzi and non-processed food goes higher and limit your patient to no more than two tablespoons of oil in the entire cooking in the day which in Indian cuisine is very difficult I had to change my housekeeping three times because of too much of oil oil in the in the dishes any other questions yes I just want to ask you what is your opinion open yes yeah so so sorry I forgot to answer Dr Erwin's question what is your stake on synthetic nutritional supplements which comes into from Herbalife as a nutritionist who worked for companies that sold these products they are good in the prescription format you should prescribe it nutritionist should prescribe it should not take it and just double it but for you to tell the person that there are no side effects or there are side effects will not work in today's day and age of Google all people are Googling it up people who come in my room with questions and from Google they are asking me questions trying to bowl dusra at me I can't play it to answer your question if the patient does not eat disciplined could a nutritional supplement be the nutritional convenience for the patient's nutritional in discipline then write a protein powder now Doc if you and I go to the gym and we know how to eat correctly a post workout meal which has 30 grams of protein I don't take a protein supplement but do I endorse a protein supplement to a sports player yes because he needs 30 grams of protein which he doesn't have time to digest quickly enough because he has another training two hours later so technically needs micro nutrition my vitamins minerals protein powders are needed if you feel the macro of the diet is deficient so chiefly in poor people where the diet is predominantly carbohydrate and you have muscle wasting and other issues and disorders which need bodybuilding protein the ability to fortify with a synthetic nutritional supplement again synthetic is a little aggressive because for example whey protein process whey protein is coming from where from milk you separate casein and milk casein is paneer or it becomes casein powder or becomes a whey protein powder now the question is human race is not designed to take so much of concentrated protein without carbohydrate fat and fiber so what I do I make both the world's meat you take a protein powder take 10 grams if you're a normal person 10 grams mix it up with a vegetable juice why not a fruit juice occurred why not occur why not a fruit juice why vegetable juice awesome you guys are ready to draw in the world God bless you any more questions yes so if you read his autobiography if you read his autobiography he talks about this also was was the same when he came in for a nutrition consultation so a lot of people have what is ambidextrous right they're able to use both parts of of the thing I I think today's lecture my only takeaway and giveaway to you is this the human body is constructed from the raw material if you are reconstructing your house invest in the best possible materials for you and your patients and even those of you are teaching please expand into your classroom the idea that nutrition can play a therapeutic role to your medical practice God bless you all thank you for having me today [Applause] thank you
