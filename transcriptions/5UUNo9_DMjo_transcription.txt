[3.42 - 6.66] clinics every day we practice to change
[5.22 - 10.08] the way you eat
[6.66 - 12.60] these are the reports that we use from a
[10.08 - 15.90] nutrition and a genetic point of view
[12.60 - 18.66] the human body is the hardware genes are
[15.90 - 21.12] your software so everything from the
[18.66 - 23.40] nutrition Gene report Fitness Gene
[21.12 - 26.16] report personality Gene report we've got
[23.40 - 27.96] cardio cardiovascular genetic report in
[26.16 - 31.08] fact the Cardiology Gene report is
[27.96 - 33.96] really massively thick with added
[31.08 - 36.18] incidences of heart disease today I am
[33.96 - 39.06] under a mission with my team of
[36.18 - 41.52] dietitians to look at how can we crystal

[55.98 - 61.56] favorite too the hormonal female and the
[58.74 - 65.70] male hormonal Gene report to help in
[61.56 - 67.50] fertility and we also then integrate
[65.70 - 70.02] nowadays the mic microbiome so
[67.50 - 73.14] microbiome is not genetics but you're
[70.02 - 75.18] using DNA testing to screen the bacteria
[73.14 - 76.74] in your gut so when you integrate the
[75.18 - 79.44] microbiome screening along with your
[76.74 - 81.96] genetic screen it's like I'm like an
[79.44 - 84.96] astrologer that can predict the client's
[81.96 - 86.88] future in terms of how they should eat
[84.96 - 89.10] when they should eat and how much should

[114.30 - 118.62] the microbiome test I need a poop sample
[116.52 - 122.72] so what are you waiting for let's
