[100.44 - 104.80] Indian support nutritionist team and
[102.88 - 107.48] I've been working with Kenny since the
[104.80 - 109.96] Tokyo Olympics forc that where he was a
[107.48 - 112.08] silver medalist now we are working on
[109.96 - 114.68] getting him to becoming the fastest
[112.08 - 116.56] person on the planet and the reason I
[114.68 - 119.48] like working with Kenny is because of
[116.56 - 121.64] his diligence and discipline you see we
[119.48 - 125.04] worked his genetic test his microbiome
[121.64 - 127.96] test his blood test and we put together
[125.04 - 130.52] in seon offseason competition the
[127.96 - 132.88] diamond League where he's even beat noes
[130.52 - 135.04] and noes has gotten the best of him in
[132.88 - 136.84] the Olympic trials noes has been on top
[135.04 - 141.32] and he's the fastest in the world right
[136.84 - 144.28] now but stay tuned because Kenny bner is
[141.32 - 146.88] being supported by top end scientific
[144.28 - 149.16] Sports Nutrition from Ryan Fernando and
[146.88 - 151.48] the team at Quan nutrition and the focus
[149.16 - 154.28] of these athlet is what drives me you
[151.48 - 156.60] see I get tons of requests from
[154.28 - 158.32] lifestyle clients saying please take up
[156.60 - 160.20] my case in fact in the last three months
[158.32 - 162.20] you would have heard from my team that
[160.20 - 165.12] I'm not taking up any cases because I'm
[162.20 - 167.56] busy with the Olympics my focus with the
[165.12 - 170.32] Olympic level athletes and athletes in
[167.56 - 172.92] general is their stickler to be
[170.32 - 175.60] disciplined not only in their sleep and
[172.92 - 177.16] training but also their nutrition plan
[175.60 - 179.00] you see when you give a lifestyle person
[177.16 - 181.48] a nutrition plan it's always a
[179.00 - 183.84] negotiable element when you give a diet
[181.48 - 185.64] plan to Kenneth bner he's like uh you
[183.84 - 187.84] want me to have 90 G of vot or you want
[185.64 - 189.28] me to have 100 G of oot he's not asking
[187.84 - 191.68] me whether I should have oats or should
[189.28 - 194.16] not have OOTS so the perspective over
[191.68 - 196.04] there is the dedication and discipline
[194.16 - 199.16] of these Olympic athletes at the highest
[196.04 - 202.16] level and recently I started working
[199.16 - 205.12] with Punjabi rap star hardi Sandu now
[202.16 - 207.40] hardi was an ex cricketer and the
[205.12 - 211.20] discipline and the mental grit this guy
[207.40 - 214.24] shows is mindboggling so even people who
[211.20 - 216.80] had ex athletic experience have that
[214.24 - 219.64] written determination to follow a plan
[216.80 - 223.04] to the tea they want to be coached now
[219.64 - 225.76] if you want to be coached by me in your
