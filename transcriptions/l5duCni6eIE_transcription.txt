[103.24 - 107.36] thank you the celebrity nutritionist is
[105.40 - 109.84] because most of you know that if you
[107.36 - 112.40] have a product you need to Market it and
[109.84 - 114.72] the problem with nutrition everyone owns
[112.40 - 117.00] nutrition including my mother so it
[114.72 - 119.24] become very difficult to convince people
[117.00 - 121.80] that they're good and you know they need
[119.24 - 123.72] advice for one nutritionist so a little
[121.80 - 125.36] bit of background about myself my dad's
[123.72 - 128.24] a the million my mom's a go and so my
[125.36 - 130.40] limbo soda blend okay and I studied at
[128.24 - 132.12] Goa Medical College I am not a doctor
[130.40 - 133.88] and did my clinical biochemistry food
[132.12 - 136.00] biotech Masters half a dozen
[133.88 - 137.60] certification degrees and all I worked
[136.00 - 139.04] for one of the largest supplement
[137.60 - 140.88] companies in the world before I started
[139.04 - 143.88] my own nutrition clinic so as a
[140.88 - 145.24] nutritionist I sold ambay daily all of
[143.88 - 147.84] these products and I utilize one of the
[145.24 - 150.32] largest companies in the world for for
[147.84 - 152.84] supplements and I couldn't get a job in
[150.32 - 154.52] research because I hated the lab okay so
[152.84 - 156.20] I didn't want to go into the lab and do
[154.52 - 160.32] blood testing and pipeting and all that
[156.20 - 164.08] stuff so when I sold supplements in 200
[160.32 - 167.04] and uh sorry in 1999 so I'm 48 years of
[164.08 - 170.44] age so I'm uh at at that 1975 B just to
[167.04 - 174.00] give you a context of age um every time
[170.44 - 174.00] I sold a supplement people
[174.48 - 179.28] say so over the years when I was working
[177.04 - 181.76] with the supplement companies I realized
[179.28 - 184.56] I had more teams of doctors and
[181.76 - 186.40] dietitians than sales guys because you
[184.56 - 188.72] brought a protein powder and then you
[186.40 - 192.80] called up the call center
[188.72 - 192.80] said how do I do my
[196.56 - 202.84] diet uh in 2010 I launched my own Clinic
[200.36 - 205.40] called Quan nutrition Quan Latin means
[202.84 - 206.60] incapacity so I used to play Scrabble I
[205.40 - 209.12] don't know how many of you have ever
[206.60 - 213.20] played Scrabble so it's a word game and
[209.12 - 214.72] if you ever get Q you're stuck because Q
[213.20 - 217.48] is a very difficult thing to make with
[214.72 - 219.00] seven letters and you need a u so for a
[217.48 - 220.72] strategic point of view if you got q and
[219.00 - 223.12] u you got a high number of points
[220.72 - 226.44] otherwise you're screwed so the fastest
[223.12 - 229.44] word in with q and u you could make the
[226.44 - 231.40] only threel word isqa QA so my friends
[229.44 - 233.44] used to fight with me and
[231.40 - 235.56] say it's not there me to open the
[233.44 - 239.48] dictionary qua and Latin means in
[235.56 - 241.88] capacity of or in character of so said
[239.48 - 244.32] we take Quan put nutrition discover the
[241.88 - 247.00] people's nutrition capacity so fast
[244.32 - 249.28] forward a decade and a half we are now
[247.00 - 253.24] 75 dieticians across the world with the
[249.28 - 256.96] fortune of Technology my California
[253.24 - 258.92] Indians get on a call with me and we do
[256.96 - 262.04] their health now we not only do
[258.92 - 265.60] nutrition we do genetic testing we do
[262.04 - 268.72] blood testing we do omega-3 testing we
[265.60 - 270.28] do microbiome poop testing so you may
[268.72 - 272.12] have heard of all of these things
[270.28 - 274.64] happening so what I do is when I go into
[272.12 - 278.84] a room like this is I convince people
[274.64 - 281.16] that your body is the most expensive
[278.84 - 282.64] real estate you'll ever own now I know
[281.16 - 285.20] what is the collective net worth of this
[282.64 - 286.92] room each one of you have all the I was
[285.20 - 288.92] just listening to conversation I created
[286.92 - 291.40] this company this happened and all but
[288.92 - 294.40] you are your most valuable
[291.40 - 297.04] asset and there's no denying that and so
[294.40 - 298.92] when I start working with people the
[297.04 - 301.84] first thing that I'm doing is I'm asking
[298.92 - 305.68] them for a longevity point of view when
[301.84 - 309.12] do you decide you want to live longer
[305.68 - 311.20] when do you decide that your health is a
[309.12 - 312.76] pain in your backside so there is a
[311.20 - 315.20] point in your life where suddenly
[312.76 - 317.00] something starts coming to you and it
[315.20 - 319.84] depends on your personality either you
[317.00 - 322.24] pop a pill and you say it's okay I'm a
[319.84 - 323.76] warrior I can go forward or you're like
[322.24 - 326.08] dude I need to nip this in a butd
[323.76 - 329.36] because my data set is saying that this
[326.08 - 332.84] quarter is not is not good in my body so
[329.36 - 334.64] then people start talking my friend has
[332.84 - 337.68] done intermittent
[334.64 - 339.32] fasting American guys recommending keto
[337.68 - 341.84] then my neighborhood friend he went to
[339.32 - 343.72] Baba Ram's Retreat he's doing this diet
[341.84 - 345.76] so there are a lot of people out there
[343.72 - 347.60] including me who kind of put these
[345.76 - 349.44] things together and advise people very
[347.60 - 351.80] early on when I left the supplement
[349.44 - 354.20] company to start my business I went
[351.80 - 355.72] undercover and went to 105 doctors
[354.20 - 359.12] nutritionist and alling what they have
[355.72 - 361.72] to offer most of it was in the timeline
[359.12 - 364.72] of a person for that one month of
[361.72 - 367.80] service so I said if I do this you'll be
[364.72 - 369.40] like a doctor 15 minutes next person 15
[367.80 - 372.72] minutes next person so you're just like
[369.40 - 375.20] a rat on a treadmill so I was like let's
[372.72 - 379.04] do it in a way find the people who are
[375.20 - 381.52] like my body is a r Rice I'm driving it
[379.04 - 383.48] like an 800 I need to bring it for a
[381.52 - 386.20] service and this we've been doing since
[383.48 - 388.24] 2010 people would come to us and say why
[386.20 - 390.40] do I need to do a gene test so what is a
[388.24 - 392.24] gene test human body Hardware genetics
[390.40 - 395.12] is your software genetics is your
[392.24 - 398.00] software now your mother and father have
[395.12 - 399.96] given you your destiny in terms of your
[398.00 - 402.08] genetics so I'll give you an example of
[399.96 - 404.40] a very simple thing to understand you
[402.08 - 405.96] may have heard of anemia which is low
[404.40 - 408.44] iron everyone's heard about anemia we
[405.96 - 410.48] all know anemia is is a genetic thing so
[408.44 - 413.48] you could inherit anemia from your
[410.48 - 415.56] parent now research is showing you could
[413.48 - 418.16] do infusion or you would take an iron
[415.56 - 419.92] supplement so that's called epigenetic
[418.16 - 421.92] you take something from the environment
[419.92 - 424.56] and put it onto your body okay let's do
[421.92 - 427.16] a gene test now when I started in 2010
[424.56 - 428.64] we were doing about 152 genes now they
[427.16 - 430.16] giving the coding of the whole body for
[428.64 - 432.56] about a lck and a half now this is
[430.16 - 434.12] Crystal Ball gazing into your future now
[432.56 - 436.84] here comes the problem there are two
[434.12 - 440.12] sets of people on the planet people who
[436.84 - 441.48] want to know they want forecasting data
[440.12 - 443.08] and people who say don't give me
[441.48 - 444.88] forecasting data don't give me research
[443.08 - 447.00] don't give me anything I'll make my own
[444.88 - 448.76] pathway depending on your type people
[447.00 - 451.24] who say I don't want to know I say do
[448.76 - 452.92] the nutrition genetic testing do the
[451.24 - 454.92] fitness genetic testing why Nutrition
[452.92 - 457.36] Fitness let's say for example like I
[454.92 - 459.76] have a magnesium deficiency Gene so my
[457.36 - 462.92] body in the pumpkin seeds and in the
[459.76 - 464.64] dark chocolate doesn't pull up magnesium
[462.92 - 466.20] very well so when I work out I get very
[464.64 - 468.16] tight carves are they cramp the moment I
[466.20 - 471.08] take a magnesium supplement for months
[468.16 - 473.44] on end I don't cramp I go for a vacation
[471.08 - 474.96] I forget to take my magnesium after
[473.44 - 476.64] walking wherever I'm walking you know
[474.96 - 478.80] when you go on holidays we walk the most
[476.64 - 481.56] the car start cramping so the subset
[478.80 - 483.20] data of magnesium genetic deficiency he
[481.56 - 485.96] has given me a crystal ball gazing that
[483.20 - 488.68] I need to supplement with magnesium I am
[485.96 - 490.84] also gluten intolerant so when ASA said
[488.68 - 492.16] please have dinner my first thought was
[490.84 - 494.24]  I don't know if there going to be
[492.16 - 496.32] something gluten-free because that that
[494.24 - 499.32] that crep came to me and it was I can't
[496.32 - 501.16] eat it because it's got wheat in it now
[499.32 - 503.48] I have very poked skin because I had
[501.16 - 505.80] adult acne all my life so that guy in
[503.48 - 505.80] the lab
[507.56 - 512.88] in now being a one I don't know if you
[510.08 - 515.00] know but in Goa we're all about bread
[512.88 - 517.32] we're known as paas we eat bread in
[515.00 - 519.20] morning we eat bread in afternoon so I
[517.32 - 522.60] had all this adult acne and nobody told
[519.20 - 526.36] us that bread was a culprit post doing
[522.60 - 527.68] the gene test as a cele as a nutrition
[526.36 - 529.56] that time I was not a celebrate as a
[527.68 - 533.96] nutrition I said let me stop it for 90
[529.56 - 536.56] days 90 days pimp all the clarisel all
[533.96 - 538.56] the sead all the Dermatology creams that
[536.56 - 542.48] I used for two decades it just
[538.56 - 544.40] disappeared so I changed something
[542.48 - 548.88] because of a genetic forecasting weight
[544.40 - 548.88] training my Gene says I can never become
[550.48 - 556.60] un I have a gene which is deficient in
[553.28 - 561.24] building muscle so now what happens is I
[556.60 - 561.24] enjoy my workout other
[562.32 - 566.52] walk what should I do should I work out
[564.88 - 569.64] for 20 minutes should I work out for 3
[566.52 - 572.12] hours so you will find as the world
[569.64 - 574.76] advances with variables so if you're
[572.12 - 576.76] wearing an exercise variable use it for
[574.76 - 579.56] heart rate monitoring don't use it for
[576.76 - 581.92] Sleep the Sleep data is not that
[579.56 - 584.12] accurate I'll introduce you to Dr Shane
[581.92 - 587.00] in us he's a sleep doctor he's one of
[584.12 - 589.20] the world's best with Dr danan he gave
[587.00 - 590.84] me an input I'm a huge fan of Whoop I'm
[589.20 - 592.52] a huge fan of whoop in fact if you saw
[590.84 - 594.16] vat for the World Cup so by the way
[592.52 - 595.72] verat kohy has been my client also I
[594.16 - 598.00] have a whole list of all of these big
[595.72 - 599.52] shot guys I recommend the because
[598.00 - 601.80] it's one of those variables which which
[599.52 - 603.76] doesn't distract you it gives you strain
[601.80 - 605.36] it gives you sleep he told me the Sleep
[603.76 - 606.40] data is not accurate so now what's
[605.36 - 608.64] happening is all my clients are
[606.40 - 611.24] stressing on sleep data coming back to
[608.64 - 613.16] data and genetics have an exercise
[611.24 - 615.60] variable that tells you your heart rate
[613.16 - 618.68] so today my heart rate is at 107 let me
[615.60 - 620.08] tell you why I have a cold today my son
[618.68 - 622.92] gave me the cold yesterday so I'm
[620.08 - 625.04] battling it so because I'm battling it
[622.92 - 628.04] when I do a seminar my normal heart rate
[625.04 - 631.28] when standing is 90 right now it's at
[628.04 - 633.16] 110 why is the heart rate higher because
[631.28 - 635.44] when you're stressed out or your body is
[633.16 - 638.48] battling something or you're undergoing
[635.44 - 640.80] emotional stress or psychological stress
[638.48 - 644.44] or a wrong food stress food poisoning or
[640.80 - 646.76] a virus your heart rate goes up so this
[644.44 - 649.16] can help you combat behaviors during the
[646.76 - 651.56] day could you rest a little bit more
[649.16 - 654.48] could you take um a Tulsi CA could you
[651.56 - 656.72] take something so all of these come in
[654.48 - 659.24] the forecasting of nutrition and fitness
[656.72 - 661.52] genetic the people that want to know
[659.24 - 664.04] then you do the health screening right
[661.52 - 666.36] so in my health screening fortunately
[664.04 - 669.00] touchwood I don't have one or two of the
[666.36 - 670.96] major cancer things but I have the heart
[669.00 - 673.44] Genet so I have got
[670.96 - 676.64] cardiomyopathy and one more which
[673.44 - 680.56] apparently 60% of Indians have so what
[676.64 - 682.00] do you do next you screen every year dad
[680.56 - 683.44] are you're going for a heart test why
[682.00 - 685.96] what did I do it's like you're going for
[683.44 - 688.60] a heart test so I screen my dad at 76
[685.96 - 691.32] every year and all the scans are clear
[688.60 - 694.40] so what happened is the gene has a high
[691.32 - 697.56] risk but you are lucky enough to not be
[694.40 - 699.08] dealt the card so far because on one
[697.56 - 702.52] hand you have your
[699.08 - 704.60] genetics on one hand you have your
[702.52 - 705.84] environment the way I can pictorially
[704.60 - 707.28] give this to you is you have heard of
[705.84 - 709.04] Russian Roulette Russian Roulette is
[707.28 - 711.24] they put a bullet one bullet in the gun
[709.04 - 713.24] they roll it and they click it the gun
[711.24 - 716.16] is your genetics the bullet is your
[713.24 - 719.28] lifestyle so if you have a gene for high
[716.16 - 721.16] risk now suddenly you smoke you drink
[719.28 - 723.16] you eat a high fat diet you're putting
[721.16 - 725.20] not one bullet in the gun you're putting
[723.16 - 727.92] multiple bullets in the gun and then the
[725.20 - 730.04] other thing is forced Behavior you you
[727.92 - 732.16] keep pulling the trigger so you can also
[730.04 - 733.48] not have the gun you can have the bullet
[732.16 - 735.64] and take the bullet and actually push it
[733.48 - 737.48] into your skull that is have no genetics
[735.64 - 739.36] but also have lifestyle this is more
[737.48 - 741.28] prevalent today because of the
[739.36 - 743.72] vaccination what we are finding out is
[741.28 - 745.72] post the vaccination the incidences of
[743.72 - 749.12] stroke or heart attack are higher so
[745.72 - 751.40] suppose you have blood testing give you
[749.12 - 753.04] of forecasting data even genetic testing
[751.40 - 756.28] which is more into your what's your
[753.04 - 759.04] family trajectory and then now the
[756.28 - 761.40] latest is the poop analysis the stool so
[759.04 - 763.52] now they're finding out you have more
[761.40 - 765.56] bacteria inside of you than actually
[763.52 - 767.68] human cells and this is called the gut
[765.56 - 769.52] microb so everybody in the US is talking
[767.68 - 771.12] about this naen J is talking about it
[769.52 - 772.52] biome is talking about it now India's
[771.12 - 774.28] half a dozen companies relian is
[772.52 - 775.64] invested it there's so much of research
[774.28 - 777.64] happening is that they're finding out
[775.64 - 779.60] that even rheumatoid arthritis is
[777.64 - 782.56] happening because of a gut microbi so
[779.60 - 784.52] there is one bacteria there that
[782.56 - 786.72] decid starts
[784.52 - 790.24] misbehaving why does it
[786.72 - 793.16] misbehave because of the environment on
[790.24 - 796.04] your microb so you have gundas and you
[793.16 - 799.92] have good guys as you grow
[796.04 - 802.32] older the good guys tend to die out why
[799.92 - 805.20] do they die out because maybe of your
[802.32 - 807.48] genetics or because of your lifestyle
[805.20 - 810.96] now the lifestyle that I control is
[807.48 - 814.64] sleep and diet and exercise I don't
[810.96 - 816.56] control the the the environment of
[814.64 - 818.84] psychology for that you need a mind
[816.56 - 821.72] coach you know a brain
[818.84 - 825.40] specialist um so coming back to these
[821.72 - 827.04] These are the tools okay for example in
[825.40 - 829.28] the other days I mean there's a very
[827.04 - 832.68] sensitive topic somebody committed
[829.28 - 835.12] suicide and I was very um blasy about it
[832.68 - 836.56] I like told my wife vitamin B2
[835.12 - 837.92] deficiency and his microbiome was off
[836.56 - 839.08] and he should have taken omega-3 she
[837.92 - 841.56] like how can you say something so
[839.08 - 844.36] insensitive most of the problems that
[841.56 - 847.40] are happening today is because the
[844.36 - 850.12] omega3 to Omega 6 imbalan is happening
[847.40 - 852.08] in the food chain we're eating too much
[850.12 - 854.72] of fertilizers and pesticides in the
[852.08 - 857.12] food so the first billion doll tip for
[854.72 - 858.68] you to take home don't follow a diet
[857.12 - 861.12] just go to your Logistics in your
[858.68 - 862.92] kitchen and ask them start getting me
[861.12 - 864.52] everything organic you have enough of
[862.92 - 866.04] money to start your own farm and start
[864.52 - 868.76] growing and even if it's a loss making
[866.04 - 871.60] Venture you get tomatoes that enter you
[868.76 - 874.20] that are pristine so number one tip for
[871.60 - 876.48] you to leave today is as many exposures
[874.20 - 880.44] as you have in the food that you control
[876.48 - 882.80] try and eat organic so my rice my Dal my
[880.44 - 884.56] Staples I try and buy organic my fruits
[882.80 - 886.60] and vegetables I figure it out in the
[884.56 - 889.08] organic M two three contacts and all we
[886.60 - 891.72] get that and I'll share a story with
[889.08 - 894.40] from my home SOA is my housekeeping lady
[891.72 - 897.40] she cooks food for me my wife and my son
[894.40 - 897.40] like
[897.68 - 900.68] pomegranate
[910.76 - 915.00] are you getting the Symmetry the one
[912.44 - 916.64] that's sprayed with chemicals never gets
[915.00 - 919.16] a Kea the one that's sprayed with
[916.64 - 921.40] chemical looks beautiful the organic
[919.16 - 924.64] stuff invariably is small wrinkly and
[921.40 - 927.88] ugly but your liver and your kidney
[924.64 - 929.32] absolutely love Organics so as an elite
[927.88 - 931.16] group of people this this is my first
[929.32 - 934.40] giveaway to you you don't need to follow
[931.16 - 937.12] diet plan next decade switch to eating
[934.40 - 939.20] healthier organic second do the testing
[937.12 - 941.44] to figure out what works in your body
[939.20 - 943.96] and what does not work in your body I'll
[941.44 - 945.68] move out from omega3 to from the brain
[943.96 - 948.56] health and all but you can just do a
[945.68 - 950.84] 2,400 rupe pin prick blood test and
[948.56 - 952.52] check your omega3 and Omega 6 level most
[950.84 - 955.92] of you in this room including me as a
[952.52 - 957.40] nutritionist I had a 31 is to1 ratio
[955.92 - 960.24] where the normal ratio should be 3 is
[957.40 - 962.08] to1 my son had 131 is to1 which is why
[960.24 - 963.88] he was not paying attention to class and
[962.08 - 965.56] the moment we change the Omega ratio
[963.88 - 966.56] teacher called me up 4 months later like
[965.56 - 968.76] what have you done to your son he's
[966.56 - 970.20] become an angel so these are small
[968.76 - 971.80] things that we can do from brain
[970.20 - 975.28] chemistry because our brain is made up
[971.80 - 978.00] of 60% fat so the fats we're eating in
[975.28 - 980.20] our diet are not the right fats so that
[978.00 - 982.84] calmness in your thinking
[980.20 - 984.48] changes so these are the Diagnostics
[982.84 - 986.28] doing a diet plan and doing a nutrition
[984.48 - 987.76] plan is tough especially for people in
[986.28 - 989.40] this room because of your schedules your
[987.76 - 991.32] businesses and all of that stuff you
[989.40 - 993.92] travel you eat in hotels you go here you
[991.32 - 995.92] go there and all so what I say is 365
[993.92 - 998.52] days in a year into 3 meals a day it's
[995.92 - 1000.80] about 1,000 meals see if you can be Rock
[998.52 - 1002.56] Solid every year by on 500 meals going
[1000.80 - 1004.96] into your body if you can do that the
[1002.56 - 1006.92] body will accept the other 500 start and
[1004.96 - 1010.08] this process by the time you're into
[1006.92 - 1011.84] your 50s 5560s you will start changing
[1010.08 - 1013.32] your travel schedule you'll be more
[1011.84 - 1015.84] particular about your foods at that
[1013.32 - 1018.00] point go to about 800 meals a year which
[1015.84 - 1021.00] are in your control what you choose
[1018.00 - 1023.32] sleep research is showing uh in Stanford
[1021.00 - 1026.00] they did a study they sleep deprived
[1023.32 - 1027.68] people from 8 hours to 6 hours the hippo
[1026.00 - 1032.32] campus showed
[1027.68 - 1034.56] 40% reduction in memorization and focus
[1032.32 - 1036.56] the next day if you're entering a board
[1034.56 - 1038.04] meeting please understand and you know
[1036.56 - 1040.60] this better than me when my team
[1038.04 - 1043.36] presents to me over 6 hours in a day I
[1040.60 - 1044.68] cannot falter for even 10 seconds
[1043.36 - 1045.60] because they change the slide and go to
[1044.68 - 1047.20] something else on the business
[1045.60 - 1049.56] performance I have to catch that error
[1047.20 - 1051.76] so my brain has to be alerted so the 2
[1049.56 - 1054.72] days before any board meeting in my
[1051.76 - 1056.80] company I asked my secretary not to book
[1054.72 - 1058.40] any evening counselings I try not to put
[1056.80 - 1060.36] Netflix on on those two days and go to
[1058.40 - 1061.96] bed and I do a little bit of biohacking
[1060.36 - 1063.56] I have two magnets under my mattress I
[1061.96 - 1064.92] punch in a special program and so
[1063.56 - 1067.04] there's a lot of biohacking that we can
[1064.92 - 1069.00] do when you come to me there stuff which
[1067.04 - 1070.88] rejuvenates mitochondria in your body
[1069.00 - 1072.52] which gives you very deep sleep so if
[1070.88 - 1073.68] any of you have I'm not going to
[1072.52 - 1075.00] disclose over you which of you have
[1073.68 - 1076.56] sleep problem but if you have a sleep
[1075.00 - 1078.84] problem and stuff like that later on
[1076.56 - 1081.48] just just talk to me about it so one is
[1078.84 - 1083.52] to biohack your sleep using magnets that
[1081.48 - 1085.28] mimics the Earth's resonance that's
[1083.52 - 1087.52] another way to put you into sleep so we
[1085.28 - 1089.68] did the Sleep part so please get the 8
[1087.52 - 1092.16] hours sleep I can't sleep for 8 hours
[1089.68 - 1094.44] change your diet move to 6 8 hours no no
[1092.16 - 1096.76] but I've always in Medical College I I
[1094.44 - 1098.36] did 6 hours of sleep and stuff like that
[1096.76 - 1100.84] today's lecture is about
[1098.36 - 1103.20] longevity longevity talks about reducing
[1100.84 - 1107.00] sugar and sleeping better
[1103.20 - 1109.00] simple sugar there's this thing called
[1107.00 - 1110.96] hba1c um
[1109.00 - 1113.40] anyone who has an hbon above seven in
[1110.96 - 1117.08] this room you got to take control of it
[1113.40 - 1119.44] gly glycation of hemoglobin meaning what
[1117.08 - 1122.04] sugar is going and giving T to
[1119.44 - 1124.76] hemoglobin whil that level is giving you
[1122.04 - 1127.96] glycation of hemoglobin it's also
[1124.76 - 1129.68] telling you that the sugar is attacking
[1127.96 - 1132.28] your
[1129.68 - 1135.16] DNA so you don't need to follow a diet
[1132.28 - 1138.04] plan get a blood test and determine your
[1135.16 - 1140.16] fasting sugar level your early morning
[1138.04 - 1141.32] sugar sugar level your post brander
[1140.16 - 1143.96] better still you must have seen all
[1141.32 - 1145.88] these people sporting those CGM devices
[1143.96 - 1148.20] if you're a gamification freak please
[1145.88 - 1151.20] wear one I was super entertained when I
[1148.20 - 1153.84] W one last year Christmas time Biryani
[1151.20 - 1155.92] two glasses of champagne sugar cup
[1153.84 - 1157.20] one came down 4:00 in the evening two
[1155.92 - 1158.80] more sugar spikes I had not eaten
[1157.20 - 1161.56] anything so
[1158.80 - 1163.60] like next week I tried only Biryani
[1161.56 - 1166.20] single sugar Spike next week after that
[1163.60 - 1168.64] no Biryani tried champagne double sugar
[1166.20 - 1171.60] Spike so somehow the bubbly for me
[1168.64 - 1173.84] creates a sugar Spike my brother orange
[1171.60 - 1174.88] juice no sugar Spike so both of us drank
[1173.84 - 1177.20] orange juice together and we're looking
[1174.88 - 1180.08] at our phones so by the way this device
[1177.20 - 1182.20] gives real time sugar levels I got a
[1180.08 - 1184.56] sugar Spike with with orange juice he
[1182.20 - 1187.76] got none but we nutritionist are telling
[1184.56 - 1189.52] people there is glycemic index it is how
[1187.76 - 1191.12] much sugar the rice is giving you so
[1189.52 - 1192.64] please eat brown rice brown rice has
[1191.12 - 1194.12] lower glycemic index it gives lower
[1192.64 - 1195.52] sugar to the blood I ate brown rice I
[1194.12 - 1197.56] got a sugar Spike I ate white rice I
[1195.52 - 1200.92] didn't get a sugar Spike hello how is
[1197.56 - 1202.68] that and so so I'm getting a lot of very
[1200.92 - 1203.84] I told you so kind of smiles a decade
[1202.68 - 1205.24] later because when I started doing
[1203.84 - 1207.56] genetic testing in this country every
[1205.24 - 1209.12] doctor laughed at me we started doing
[1207.56 - 1210.36] specialized testing everyone started
[1209.12 - 1211.64] laughing like no need to spend this
[1210.36 - 1213.96] money and these are doctors talking
[1211.64 - 1216.44] about it but today everyone's talking
[1213.96 - 1218.20] about the poop test the CGM test and all
[1216.44 - 1221.52] and why am I laughing because when we
[1218.20 - 1223.20] did Qua we said it is your individuality
[1221.52 - 1226.40] so there are people who can survive on
[1223.20 - 1229.00] one meal a day so when I put people on
[1226.40 - 1230.68] the C GM and the watch and the Heart rat
[1229.00 - 1233.12] and these blood tests we're suddenly
[1230.68 - 1235.12] finding out some people like me I can't
[1233.12 - 1237.04] do a one meal a day my sugar drops so
[1235.12 - 1238.80] badly then it Peaks after that so I've
[1237.04 - 1240.76] got to do minimum two meals a day and
[1238.80 - 1243.40] there are some people I have this one
[1240.76 - 1245.00] gentleman he fasts for 8 Days he's only
[1243.40 - 1247.60] doing cucumber and dry fruits and
[1245.00 - 1250.80] anything and he's like a crazy helmit is
[1247.60 - 1253.04] a 65 or whatever sugar line is stable
[1250.80 - 1255.40] line so if you want to know more about
[1253.04 - 1258.36] sugar and anti-aging there's a guy
[1255.40 - 1259.92] called Dr David Sinclair Dr David
[1258.36 - 1262.00] Sinclair is one of the leading
[1259.92 - 1264.60] researchers in the world he's in New
[1262.00 - 1267.68] York who basically talks about
[1264.60 - 1271.60] anti-aging so sinair has the equivalent
[1267.68 - 1274.20] of I think 300 glasses of wine a day but
[1271.60 - 1277.56] he doesn't drink that much alcohol the
[1274.20 - 1279.36] res troll so up until now what the wine
[1277.56 - 1281.12] industry was doing is like wine is very
[1279.36 - 1282.56] good for anti-aging and heart disease
[1281.12 - 1285.88] but now they're finding out it is the
[1282.56 - 1289.12] res trol in the grape that has got an
[1285.88 - 1291.20] anti-aging Factor to the extent that the
[1289.12 - 1293.96] mice that they did the research on when
[1291.20 - 1296.12] they gave them Resveratrol and another
[1293.96 - 1300.08] medical product called
[1296.12 - 1302.60] Ramy they found the mice lived 30%
[1300.08 - 1305.32] longer so if you watch Dr David
[1302.60 - 1306.96] Sinclair's videos he doesn't look older
[1305.32 - 1311.04] than 40 years of age but he's already in
[1306.96 - 1312.92] his 50s so this longevity perspective is
[1311.04 - 1315.56] coming from small small perspectives
[1312.92 - 1316.88] like this but I would say to you so have
[1315.56 - 1319.72] you ever seen that Zen car with the
[1316.88 - 1323.36] Ferrari sticker on it
[1319.72 - 1324.80] right now imagine your body Zen but you
[1323.36 - 1327.48] put a Ferrari sticker that's your
[1324.80 - 1329.96] thinking I want to be healthy same thing
[1327.48 - 1331.80] happens in my clinic people come in I
[1329.96 - 1334.20] will do whatever I want to do you give
[1331.80 - 1336.04] me resveratol you give me anti-aging you
[1334.20 - 1337.76] give me collagen you give me nmn you
[1336.04 - 1340.40] give me all the antien so that's like a
[1337.76 - 1343.52] sticker on my talk to you today is just
[1340.40 - 1348.08] do one thing as a starter focus on the
[1343.52 - 1350.92] Dal chavel Roy first in the next decade
[1348.08 - 1353.20] are these supplements good to take if
[1350.92 - 1355.88] you take them take them under guidance
[1353.20 - 1357.44] take them with a blood test so you know
[1355.88 - 1359.36] oh this is my liver enzyme these are my
[1357.44 - 1361.00] kidney enzyme this is my hemoglobin
[1359.36 - 1364.04] these are all my vitamins and mins I
[1361.00 - 1367.52] take this stuff 6 months later check it
[1364.04 - 1369.60] out and so that leads you to one of the
[1367.52 - 1372.04] leading proponents of longevity on the
[1369.60 - 1373.76] planet he is an entrepreneur like you a
[1372.04 - 1375.88] billionaire his name is Brian Johnson
[1373.76 - 1377.68] you must have seen him on Instagram on
[1375.88 - 1379.64] LinkedIn and everything so what Brian
[1377.68 - 1381.68] Johnson is doing he's taking 111
[1379.64 - 1384.16] supplements a day he's doing all the
[1381.68 - 1385.88] possible things as a 46 year old and his
[1384.16 - 1389.60] biological age is
[1385.88 - 1394.20] 18 by the way at 48 I'm at 35 years of
[1389.60 - 1395.04] biological age so imagine if I earn 1 CR
[1394.20 - 1399.08] a
[1395.04 - 1401.88] year and I'm supposed to live to 70 but
[1399.08 - 1402.76] now my biological age is 35 birth secret
[1401.88 - 1404.76] is
[1402.76 - 1406.92] 48 that's why I say your body is the
[1404.76 - 1408.60] most expensive real estate because if
[1406.92 - 1411.68] you are 15 years
[1408.60 - 1414.20] younger your net worth based on your
[1411.68 - 1416.08] earning per year I am the best
[1414.20 - 1417.00] investment that you can ever have which
[1416.08 - 1420.20] is
[1417.00 - 1423.36] longevity so why wait till you're 60 or
[1420.20 - 1426.76] 70 or 80 for the longevity investment
[1423.36 - 1429.20] start with every morning saying I am the
[1426.76 - 1432.40] most expensive real estate on the
[1429.20 - 1433.56] planet my mind is in charge of my body
[1432.40 - 1436.08] not my taste
[1433.56 - 1438.44] buts once you start telling your body
[1436.08 - 1442.48] this on an everyday you can set yourself
[1438.44 - 1445.28] on a track then you start taking data
[1442.48 - 1447.44] and the simplest data is I can give you
[1445.28 - 1450.40] my number after this you can WhatsApp me
[1447.44 - 1453.84] there's a scale costing 9,600 rupees
[1450.40 - 1456.20] it's called the omon K scan once or
[1453.84 - 1458.12] twice in the month you take measurements
[1456.20 - 1460.76] on that scale I'll send you a video it
[1458.12 - 1462.92] gives you your metabolic age it gives
[1460.76 - 1466.00] you a weight but it gives you your
[1462.92 - 1468.80] visceral fat and your body fat all you
[1466.00 - 1470.32] have to do is stand on that and
[1468.80 - 1473.12] understand your
[1470.32 - 1477.32] muscle muscle and
[1473.12 - 1480.40] fat muscle is the only age reversible
[1477.32 - 1482.16] organ in the human body so in America
[1480.40 - 1485.12] there was this old age home there was
[1482.16 - 1487.40] one group of people they told them boss
[1485.12 - 1490.20] we're putting Bingo Ludo and all in your
[1487.40 - 1491.56] basement other group of people 72y old
[1490.20 - 1493.32] they told boss we're putting a gym in
[1491.56 - 1495.16] your basement and you have to do
[1493.32 - 1498.72] exercise every day every day you have to

[1503.72 - 1507.88] this
[1504.88 - 1507.88] stuff
[1508.20 - 1514.00] exercise 6 months later they came out
[1510.60 - 1518.60] and they took a biopsy from the quadrip
[1514.00 - 1521.48] muscle Bingo housing group jyming group
[1518.60 - 1523.32] they found that the muscle in this group
[1521.48 - 1527.24] grew by 6 months
[1523.32 - 1530.28] older the muscle in this group reversed
[1527.24 - 1531.92] in age by 6 years so the 72y old now had
[1530.28 - 1534.36] 66 year old
[1531.92 - 1537.04] muscles so that is why people today are
[1534.36 - 1538.92] asking you to weight train to resistance

[1610.88 - 1617.00] vehicle I bought a scoda superb cuz my
[1614.28 - 1618.24] body is the most expensive real estate
[1617.00 - 1621.76] you don't have to make make the decision
[1618.24 - 1624.60] in this room so get that expert coming
[1621.76 - 1627.96] up so even if like in 12 sessions a
[1624.60 - 1630.00] month of weight training 12 into 12 144
[1627.96 - 1633.72] sessions set up
[1630.00 - 1636.16] 2024 can I do 144 sessions and ask that
[1633.72 - 1637.92] person to track you and pay that person
[1636.16 - 1641.80] cuz if that person turns up and trains
[1637.92 - 1641.80] you even if you do 100
[1642.04 - 1647.28] sessions it's a win for your body you
[1645.00 - 1649.20] have started even if you do 50 sessions
[1647.28 - 1652.04] with a win for your body but trust me
[1649.20 - 1655.84] over a period of time 2024 you may do 24
[1652.04 - 1658.44] sessions 2025 you may do 40 sessions but
[1655.84 - 1661.80] every decade you improve your weight
[1658.44 - 1665.68] training so I now have 23 kgs of muscle
[1661.80 - 1667.28] in my 70 kg frame so in the last 5 years
[1665.68 - 1670.88] it has not dropped in fact I've
[1667.28 - 1673.20] increased muscle by 800 G so that is the
[1670.88 - 1675.04] anti-aging battle that we can start
[1673.20 - 1677.52] before we start getting all the experts
[1675.04 - 1679.16] to India and going and injecting us with
[1677.52 - 1680.92] IV fluids so by the way if you want to
[1679.16 - 1683.32] do the intervenous infusions with
[1680.92 - 1686.00] glutathione and magnesium and meos
[1683.32 - 1688.64] cocktail it's safe to do under doctor's
[1686.00 - 1691.08] prescription nothing is going to happen
[1688.64 - 1694.00] the whiskey that we drink and the smoke
[1691.08 - 1697.68] that we inhale in our cities is far more
[1694.00 - 1700.24] worse than the longevity medical hacks
[1697.68 - 1703.00] that people are doing because they are
[1700.24 - 1705.32] done with a premise of making you
[1703.00 - 1708.32] younger so the question is are there any
[1705.32 - 1710.64] side effects yes you become younger
[1708.32 - 1713.16] are there any side effects to your
[1710.64 - 1714.64] systems maybe you like for example I'm
[1713.16 - 1717.44] allergic to vitamin
[1714.64 - 1719.60] C I can't take Vitamin C so when I did
[1717.44 - 1721.56] the vitamin C infusion I started itching
[1719.60 - 1724.12] so I can't take a vitamin C
[1721.56 - 1726.08] infusion but guava is my best friend
[1724.12 - 1728.36] because one guava is equivalent to four
[1726.08 - 1731.12] oranges so I'm asking my wife let's buy
[1728.36 - 1732.48] a guava farm so like why you want to buy
[1731.12 - 1734.40] a guav farm and just make friends with
[1732.48 - 1736.16] all the guava dealers in the country
[1734.40 - 1738.40] promote guavas and you know you'll get
[1736.16 - 1742.52] the best guavas so make guava your best
[1738.40 - 1745.04] friend so this is my summary today that
[1742.52 - 1747.36] you are the most expensive real estate
[1745.04 - 1750.12] wait train because it's going to help
[1747.36 - 1752.60] you does fasting work oh I could do like
[1750.12 - 1755.32] 4 hours on fasting the problem with
[1752.60 - 1756.60] telling people not to eat is dangerous
[1755.32 - 1758.52] because they're like no no this guy
[1756.60 - 1760.60] can't cut it and everything but once you
[1758.52 - 1762.64] start planning your Nutrition a little
[1760.60 - 1765.52] bit better you suddenly come to me like
[1762.64 - 1767.64] okay I'm sorted after 2 years can I fast
[1765.52 - 1770.84] for 24 hours so I'll give you the secret
[1767.64 - 1774.12] research is showing 30h hour fast is
[1770.84 - 1775.96] where you take a ly to the old
[1774.12 - 1778.08] mitochondria in your body and whack it
[1775.96 - 1779.48] out of your body and when you whack it
[1778.08 - 1781.80] out of the body the body says produce
[1779.48 - 1784.48] new mitochondria so when you're whacking
[1781.80 - 1786.56] on the old mitochondria in a 30 hour
[1784.48 - 1787.76] fast they're also whacking out the
[1786.56 - 1790.44] cancer
[1787.76 - 1793.72] cells so what our grandfathers and
[1790.44 - 1797.84] great-grandfathers did the special Fast
[1793.72 - 1800.60] in Hindu in Islam in Christianity
[1797.84 - 1802.44] I'm a Christian I'm a lazy Catholic lent
[1800.60 - 1804.80] season we're supposed to fast if it's in
[1802.44 - 1807.52] Raman there are 14 days which really you
[1804.80 - 1809.96] know focuses on the body and then we
[1807.52 - 1812.16] have uh in Hinduism you have your
[1809.96 - 1814.40] Mondays and Fridays and certain periods
[1812.16 - 1817.40] the navaratri period and all so please
[1814.40 - 1820.08] go in that direction final points if
[1817.40 - 1822.76] you're ever doing your blood test find a
[1820.08 - 1825.08] place that will collate your blood test
[1822.76 - 1827.84] and keep it because you guys are data
[1825.08 - 1830.52] guys you are businessmen the data of
[1827.84 - 1832.72] your own body is the best indicator 10
[1830.52 - 1834.00] years later when you walk into a place
[1832.72 - 1835.36] and somebody says okay let's do your
[1834.00 - 1837.32] blood test like here's my last 10 years
[1835.36 - 1839.88] of blood data if I get something like
[1837.32 - 1842.12] that I'm likeing there's a trend line
[1839.88 - 1846.04] huh homo has increased in
[1842.12 - 1848.08] 2021 then it's come down so that would
[1846.04 - 1850.60] help you get to the next level and the
[1848.08 - 1852.92] final point I predict that AI is going
[1850.60 - 1854.76] to put me out of a job in the next 5
[1852.92 - 1855.88] years and which is why I'm moving in the
[1854.76 - 1858.52] speaker
[1855.88 - 1860.44] Direction because AI cannot convince you
[1858.52 - 1862.07] to start a human being will have to
[1860.44 - 1864.98] convince you to
[1862.07 - 1868.12] [Music]
[1864.98 - 1868.12] [Applause]
[1869.48 - 1872.48] start
