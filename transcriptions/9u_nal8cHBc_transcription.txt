[7.52 - 12.04] congratulations mommies well you're
[9.80 - 13.96] going to be holding a new bundle of joy
[12.04 - 17.64] now I have worked with celebrity film
[13.96 - 19.52] stars rock stars on their newborn babies
[17.64 - 22.72] when they are in the womb here are some
[19.52 - 24.88] of my secrets that I privately give
[22.72 - 26.72] these celebrity moms in my nutrition
[24.88 - 28.76] counseling room number one it's but
[26.72 - 31.96] obvious you have to eat when you have to
[28.76 - 33.84] eat organic you have to eat with a plan
[31.96 - 35.64] so get a nutrition plan carefully
[33.84 - 37.48] balanced you don't need to eat for two
[35.64 - 39.04] you need to eat only about 3 to 400
[37.48 - 41.36] calories more per day when you're
[39.04 - 44.40] carrying a new born baby in you most
[41.36 - 46.48] important get a nutritional blood test
[44.40 - 48.36] done look at all your vitamins look at
[46.48 - 50.64] all your minerals look at hemoglobin
[48.36 - 52.68] fertin and iron this is crucial and
[50.64 - 56.28] important but nobody's talking about
[52.68 - 60.20] nobody's talking about omega3 you can do
[56.28 - 61.96] a pin prick blood test DM me message me
[60.20 - 64.44] get in touch with me at the qua
[61.96 - 66.12] nutrition clinics or wherever I am on
[64.44 - 67.88] the internet I will reply to you about
[66.12 - 69.76] how I can send you a kit where you can
[67.88 - 72.12] just take a pin prick blood samp and put
[69.76 - 75.12] it onto a filter paper and determine the
[72.12 - 77.04] omega3 and Omega 6 ratios in your blood
[75.12 - 80.32] now why is this important did you know
[77.04 - 84.24] that your child's brain requires dh8
[80.32 - 87.60] which is a key omega3 molecule and most
[84.24 - 89.40] women will lose up to 2% of their brain
[87.60 - 91.32] Yes you heard me right you will lose up
[89.40 - 94.00] to 2% % of your brain because your brain
[91.32 - 95.80] contains DHA the mother's brain and you
[94.00 - 97.48] sacrifice that to give it to your child
[95.80 - 99.60] now you don't need to do this if you
[97.48 - 103.60] know the omega-3 and you take the right
[99.60 - 105.88] fatty fish or flax seed or chia seeds or
[103.60 - 108.04] walnuts you can boost your body's
[105.88 - 109.84] natural content of Omega-3 to take a
[108.04 - 112.44] nutritional supplement and get in touch
[109.84 - 115.28] with your doctor and he or she should be
[112.44 - 117.84] able to prescribe a good Omega DHA
[115.28 - 119.96] supplement for you third Point start
[117.84 - 121.80] exercising look at permission from from
[119.96 - 123.48] your doctor to do yoga and weight
[121.80 - 126.68] training I remember when my wife was
[123.48 - 129.52] carrying she weight trained and she had
[126.68 - 131.48] a nonc section delivery merely because
[129.52 - 133.68] the doctor said Madam because you walked
[131.48 - 135.68] you did yoga and you trained well you
[133.68 - 138.76] had a Flawless delivery and we have only
[135.68 - 141.76] one child when you want to get a good
[138.76 - 144.64] baby you want to reduce the exposure to
[141.76 - 147.28] EMF electromagnetic frequency I see
[144.64 - 148.72] people with laptops on their lap don't
[147.28 - 150.92] keep that next to you because it's
[148.72 - 153.36] pinging on blue Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
[150.92 - 155.16] don't use the Bluetooth headphones keep
[153.36 - 157.52] your mobile phone away from you put it
[155.16 - 160.04] on speaker phone better still get one of
[157.52 - 161.56] those old age cordless phones and
[160.04 - 164.48] connect it to your mobile phone and talk
[161.56 - 166.84] from far away look at se I see a lot of
[164.48 - 169.40] mothers because now they are wanting to
[166.84 - 171.12] Netflix have downtime they postpone
[169.40 - 173.52] their bedtime into later night did you
[171.12 - 176.52] know that research says the earlier you
[173.52 - 179.32] sleep to the sunset the deeper sleep you
[176.52 - 181.64] get in the first 3 hours releases growth
[179.32 - 184.44] hormone the growth hormone rejuvenates
[181.64 - 186.84] your body gets the baby's cellular
[184.44 - 188.96] development even better to sleep better
[186.84 - 191.12] walk on grass research is showing that
[188.96 - 194.28] when mothers walk on grass they
[191.12 - 196.56] discharge to the Earth the negative EMF
[194.28 - 199.28] radiations that we are surrounded in
[196.56 - 201.84] this bubble of technology so please do
[199.28 - 203.56] walk on grass dad's your responsibility
[201.84 - 205.56] if you're watching this video take your
[203.56 - 207.88] wife for a walk just walk and talk on
[205.56 - 211.20] the grass that's very very important
[207.88 - 213.24] second aqi a Quality Index we all live
[211.20 - 216.20] in cities with tremendous amount of
[213.24 - 218.64] pollution so what I would suggest is for
[216.20 - 222.08] the time in your house which is 10 to 12
[218.64 - 224.24] hours invest in a great air filter it
[222.08 - 226.16] reduces the paths per million which
[224.24 - 228.00] actually has a phenomenal impact you
[226.16 - 230.28] know those molecules go into your body
[228.00 - 233.72] and there's Jaga happening now if the
[230.28 - 235.32] baby's nutrition is there and then there
[233.72 - 237.40] is the Jaga nutrition there is a
[235.32 - 239.20] nutrition to protect the body imagine if
[237.40 - 241.32] there was no fight inside of your body
[239.20 - 243.96] because of pollution then all the
[241.32 - 245.60] nutrition and energy could be saved for
[243.96 - 248.56] the energy of the development of the
[245.60 - 250.80] fetus unborn child final points that you
[248.56 - 253.96] need to do is get some sunlight look in
[250.80 - 257.44] the Sun and I tell a lot of mothers lift
[253.96 - 260.20] your um shirt or t-shirt or clothing
[257.44 - 262.96] above your belly and let your child's
[260.20 - 266.60] get some sunshine through the womb so
[262.96 - 268.48] the best time is 9 to 12 in the morning
[266.60 - 270.64] and uh see that you step out and see
[268.48 - 272.52] that your stomach and the womb gets
[270.64 - 273.84] exposed to some sunlight because that
[272.52 - 275.88] kid inside of you is going to be
[273.84 - 277.80] squinting which means better eye
[275.88 - 281.68] development and he as he develops in the
[277.80 - 285.36] womb and the final Point Music research
[281.68 - 289.44] is now saying that everything from schas
[285.36 - 292.16] to mozat and b or just you humming or
[289.44 - 294.72] you having a nice conversation the
[292.16 - 297.08] baby's auditory signal picks this up for
[294.72 - 299.52] the brain development and sensory
[297.08 - 301.64] perception so if you want a great kid if
[299.52 - 304.52] if you want a musician start listening
[301.64 - 306.60] to music better still dance a little bit
[304.52 - 310.48] your baby is going to be one hell of a
[306.60 - 313.64] Michael Jackson if you do this above all
[310.48 - 317.08] sleep well eat well think positive
[313.64 - 319.76] thoughts most people if they vibrate at
[317.08 - 322.28] a negative frequency negative thoughts
[319.76 - 325.48] the baby is receiving those negative
[322.28 - 328.12] thoughts you have to have to be positive
[325.48 - 330.44] and above all as I always say your body
[328.12 - 333.72] is the most expensive real estate you
[330.44 - 336.24] will ever own and now you just decided
[333.72 - 338.64] to do some expansion which is the new
[336.24 - 341.28] baby and that baby is going to be your
[338.64 - 343.56] next best most expensive real estate
