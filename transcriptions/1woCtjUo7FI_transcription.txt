[0.08 - 6.48] as an entrepreneur what do you do as Mr
[2.80 - 6.48] Navin tiari what do you do when you
[8.57 - 13.96] [Music]
[11.20 - 16.08] walk Navin what was the starting point
[13.96 - 17.84] for you where you said okay I need to
[16.08 - 20.68] start working out I need to start taking
[17.84 - 22.80] care of my health or I need to do a diet
[20.68 - 25.72] or a health coaching plan what was the
[22.80 - 29.04] shift or the trigger so Ryan I actually
[25.72 - 31.76] was always doing it I was always on a
[29.04 - 34.00] workout regime or a Sprint regime or
[31.76 - 35.92] running regime for how long what age
[34.00 - 37.88] maybe for like 20 years or so prior that
[35.92 - 41.72] I was playing but here's what was
[37.88 - 45.56] happening I would do it and then like I
[41.72 - 48.52] would not see myself get fit or if I did
[45.56 - 50.64] get fit it'd be under extreme exercise
[48.52 - 52.96] like you would just like like you would
[50.64 - 54.60] do almost inhuman levels of you know
[52.96 - 55.60] something for like you know six months
[54.60 - 57.68] or something and you would kind of
[55.60 - 61.08] become very fit and I was just getting
[57.68 - 63.64] very bogged down by this whole thing of
[61.08 - 66.00] like it cannot be so hard like you know
[63.64 - 68.44] we've all lived Generations have lived
[66.00 - 70.48] and cannot be that everybody has to like
[68.44 - 72.16] you know not eat anything or work out so
[70.48 - 74.24] much and you know I somewhere felt
[72.16 - 78.16] something is wrong corre but coming to
[74.24 - 80.12] you where it helped was so that was the
[78.16 - 81.24] trigger that was the like there that
[80.12 - 83.04] there was this like thing that was
[81.24 - 85.96] bogging me down because you know I just
[83.04 - 87.40] felt this was too hard uh and require
[85.96 - 89.60] too much discipline and whatever have
[87.40 - 91.80] you and I think coming to you was that
[89.60 - 93.52] was the premise come to you in when you
[91.80 - 94.80] started the nutrition plan obviously you
[93.52 - 98.56] knew that you know you're going to get
[94.80 - 100.64] disciplined structured diet and all what
[98.56 - 102.60] was the trigger for you to say that I
[100.64 - 105.04] have to do this accurately or I had to
[102.60 - 107.28] do well I think you you got my DNA uh
[105.04 - 108.64] test done right that was scientific
[107.28 - 111.64] right you were not you didn't you felt
[108.64 - 115.76] it was personal yeah it was person it
[111.64 - 118.76] was deeply linked to me and you didn't
[115.76 - 120.56] come and say hey naen like all right
[118.76 - 123.28] let's go lose weight
[120.56 - 125.72] said hey here is what your body can and
[123.28 - 129.44] can accept and cannot accept right so
[125.72 - 132.72] that became important to me and then I
[129.44 - 136.00] think you got my blood work done you got
[132.72 - 137.88] my gen test the omega3 the omega3 pin
[136.00 - 139.92] all all of those like multiple test done
[137.88 - 141.56] and everything was scientific so I kind
[139.92 - 143.72] of then looked at the
[141.56 - 147.08] dashboard and said all right I got go
[143.72 - 148.88] fix the dashboard and then comes the
[147.08 - 151.84] part that I thought must be very hard to
[148.88 - 154.28] fix which is to say or you got to do
[151.84 - 157.48] like some crazy amount of things and in
[154.28 - 158.32] reality I think the change that came in
[157.48 - 161.60] was
[158.32 - 163.64] more lifestyle which was you know things
[161.60 - 164.44] that you one Logistics is you needed a
[163.64 - 166.96] new
[164.44 - 168.80] Chef that was one but I think more
[166.96 - 171.96] importantly you you said hey based on
[168.80 - 174.60] the DNA I am DNA level gluten intolerant
[171.96 - 176.24] for example and you know it causes you
[174.60 - 178.28] know it will eventually cause plaque in
[176.24 - 180.80] the heart and you know that's like fine
[178.28 - 182.20] this is a good enough reason thing yeah
[180.80 - 185.60] good enough reason not to actually so in
[182.20 - 187.76] the last 9 or 10 months um you've been
[185.60 - 189.36] completely gluten completely gluten-
[187.76 - 190.56] free and you know you told me the thing
[189.36 - 194.40] you told me is to
[190.56 - 195.72] walk so I walk an hour or do yoga and uh
[194.40 - 197.76] and how are you tracking your walking
[195.72 - 200.04] steps or not I I track them you know
[197.76 - 202.56] when I go for a walk I just put it on on
[200.04 - 204.88] the phone put it on the phone or put put
[202.56 - 208.56] as an entrepreneur I mean I tell people
[204.88 - 210.20] to walk what do you do as Mr Navin tiari
[208.56 - 211.64] what do you do when you walk well there
[210.20 - 214.00] are two there are two kinds of walks
[211.64 - 216.04] that I end up doing one is I know I can
[214.00 - 218.08] do them at at an hour where I can call
[216.04 - 220.60] up people and talk so you you do a lot
[218.08 - 222.24] of business I just I just get on a call
[220.60 - 225.00] and and so that's your exercise for the
[222.24 - 226.56] day yeah that becomes one but more often
[225.00 - 228.56] than not actually I just go for a walk
[226.56 - 229.84] because it's the best thinking time
[228.56 - 231.44] because you know when you're running
[229.84 - 233.72] very hard it's not really you know
[231.44 - 235.84] you're you're you are I used to be like
[233.72 - 237.48] it's not a thinking time thing but I I
[235.84 - 239.36] do think it and when you walk and have
[237.48 - 241.60] to think just before heading out the
[239.36 - 242.96] door have you got the problem in your
[241.60 - 245.12] head and then you go to walk or you just
[242.96 - 246.80] let it flow I just let it flow it's
