[15.08 - 19.80] doesn't get attracted to you one is
[17.28 - 21.72] called abhas practice and second is
[19.80 - 24.32] called waga Detachment it's very
[21.72 - 26.48] important consciously you actually build
[24.32 - 28.28] these two qualities of you remember the
[26.48 - 32.44] first time we learned
[28.28 - 36.40] walking we never got attached to the
[32.44 - 40.48] failure why did you choose him in so
[36.40 - 43.52] many gurus and sages and and people of
[40.48 - 46.92] um exuberance in our past illustrious
[43.52 - 49.12] history why him Chaka was not a king he
[46.92 - 52.80] was a king maker have you ever heard
[49.12 - 55.36] about elephants being given meat no
[52.80 - 57.36] alcohol No No in fact subscribed by
[55.36 - 59.24] chanak and arastra not for ordinary
[57.36 - 61.36] elephants chanaka was training war
[59.24 - 63.08] elephants so think about it that
[61.36 - 65.80] pregnant elephants are given different
[63.08 - 67.44] diet and war elephants different diet so
[65.80 - 70.20] why only limited to human beings and
[67.44 - 73.84] nutritionist works for the whole society
[70.20 - 76.00] and all living beings Anna and Mana Anna
[73.84 - 78.08] is word Mana is mind they're
[76.00 - 80.68] interconnected there is a saying that if
[78.08 - 82.92] you want to cut a tree you should have
[80.68 - 85.28] the ax being sharpened from time to time
[82.92 - 87.24] correct meditation is that sharpening of
[85.28 - 89.64] the mind that you require because you
[87.24 - 92.60] work with the world with your mind you
[89.64 - 96.96] are known as a gentleman who guides
[92.60 - 99.68] people on in what I call as the the
[96.96 - 103.92] vibrational plane or the brain plane or
[99.68 - 103.92] the meditation plane where did that get
[104.08 - 110.16] started my entire life I look for gurus
[107.96 - 111.92] spiritual people people that vibrate
[110.16 - 114.40] with the universe and I had a chance
[111.92 - 116.72] encounter and now I'm going to ask those
[114.40 - 120.24] questions directly to the meditation
[116.72 - 122.60] Guru Dr P welcome thank you so much Ryan
[120.24 - 124.64] s it's an honor to be with you it's a
[122.60 - 126.80] it's it's a vibrational honor for me to
[124.64 - 129.40] be in your presence to be very honest
[126.80 - 131.28] with you I get attracted to people I
[129.40 - 133.44] think the universe makes me bump into
[131.28 - 135.60] them we met at the orange literature
[133.44 - 137.64] Festival in napur in nagpur and we just
[135.60 - 140.24] bumped into each other and I said to
[137.64 - 142.44] myself I do breath work I know about
[140.24 - 144.80] meditation but let me figure out if I
[142.44 - 146.80] can get an appointment with a guru who
[144.80 - 148.40] will talk about it and I was doing a lot
[146.80 - 150.20] of research about you before coming in
[148.40 - 152.28] here I'll be honest before that I knew
[150.20 - 155.16] nothing about you and then I was like
[152.28 - 159.28] hey Dr pill you've written about
[155.16 - 162.00] chanakya now in my podcast of H shots
[159.28 - 165.12] I'm like the guru of Moringa and amla
[162.00 - 167.52] and everything but doctor I do not know
[165.12 - 170.28] who chanaka is so can you please
[167.52 - 172.48] enlighten me sure in fact Ryan sir I'm
[170.28 - 174.28] glad you don't know about Chaka I have a
[172.48 - 176.36] new
[174.28 - 178.56] market because if you already know it
[176.36 - 181.40] then I'm not required in fact that's the
[178.56 - 184.00] way I think gurus work they take you to
[181.40 - 186.80] a new dimension so let me speak about
[184.00 - 190.04] two aspects of chanaka the person and
[186.80 - 191.88] the wisdom because persons have wisdom
[190.04 - 194.60] but they're too different and let me
[191.88 - 197.12] tell you in India at least to begin with
[194.60 - 200.04] most of us have heard about chanaka you
[197.12 - 203.48] may not know about chanaka so he lived
[200.04 - 205.40] in the 4th Century BC roughly 2,400
[203.48 - 208.72] years ago
[205.40 - 212.64] and geographically he was in a place
[208.72 - 216.72] called as partly ra Parra is today's
[212.64 - 218.52] padna Bihar and he was a teacher son who
[216.72 - 221.64] became a teacher himself of political
[218.52 - 225.76] science what we call Rajan Niti he went
[221.64 - 227.76] to takshashila studied came back and he
[225.76 - 230.92] did many Fantastic things in his life
[227.76 - 233.04] for example he had dethroned a king
[230.92 - 235.52] called danan and made his student
[233.04 - 238.80] Chandra Gupta Moria the leader or the
[235.52 - 240.84] Emperor of India and all this is 2400
[238.80 - 243.76] years ago when even Alexander came to
[240.84 - 246.80] India and with the intellect that he had
[243.76 - 249.44] remember chanaka was not a king he was a
[246.80 - 251.32] king maker he did not have an army but
[249.44 - 253.44] he trained armies so that's why he's
[251.32 - 256.40] called the king maker yes absolutely
[253.44 - 259.16] okay and he defeated Alexander also and
[256.40 - 262.24] all his work has been documented in the
[259.16 - 264.24] book called as arastra and chak ni so
[262.24 - 266.52] second part of the wisdom so even though
[264.24 - 268.04] the person is physically dead and gone
[266.52 - 271.56] you know you are an author
[268.04 - 275.00] yourself person can go but knowledge can
[271.56 - 277.28] remain wow so that's a documentation and
[275.00 - 279.88] even this podcast would be part of the
[277.28 - 281.52] Legacy that leave We Leave Behind true
[279.88 - 283.76] because in the olden days people used to
[281.52 - 286.16] write in Palm leaves now we have printed
[283.76 - 288.48] books but we are M to digital format
[286.16 - 290.48] remember friends that a podcast is not
[288.48 - 292.76] just for viewing it is a reference
[290.48 - 296.08] material for ages to come that's so
[292.76 - 298.92] powerful Dr P that's so powerful I never
[296.08 - 302.00] assumed that you know teaching in the
[298.92 - 303.88] current D and age the narip paata or the
[302.00 - 307.16] leaves that we wrote and everything now
[303.88 - 309.08] is the new age of podcast so one is now
[307.16 - 311.16] you have enlighten me who chanak is I'm
[309.08 - 315.76] looking at this person and he's a king
[311.16 - 319.84] maker but why did you choose him in so
[315.76 - 322.28] many gurus and sages and and people of
[319.84 - 325.08] exuberance in our past illustrious
[322.28 - 326.64] history why him in fact there's a saying
[325.08 - 329.92] you don't choose a person the person
[326.64 - 331.92] chooses you please enlighten us yeah so
[329.92 - 334.12] I'll tell you Chaka is what we call Open
[331.92 - 336.04] Source knowledge okay so it is already
[334.12 - 339.40] there many people have studied about him
[336.04 - 341.32] read about him worked about him but in
[339.40 - 343.24] my case it was a blessing that came to
[341.32 - 345.44] me so like any other person I was
[343.24 - 349.72] interested in Indian history Indian
[345.44 - 352.04] characters Indian Heroes gurus Saints
[349.72 - 353.88] sages and I've been reading a lot but
[352.04 - 355.76] you'll be surprised that when I started
[353.88 - 357.32] my entrepreneural journey almost 25
[355.76 - 359.68] years ago you'll be surprised there was
[357.32 - 361.84] no guidance of course I had a formal MBA
[359.68 - 364.08] management study but you know I realized
[361.84 - 366.20] one thing that maybe the Western
[364.08 - 368.96] education is good we should never
[366.20 - 370.80] compare the systems of Education have
[368.96 - 372.12] the best of the best because we were a
[370.80 - 374.36] generation that were reading more
[372.12 - 376.60] English books but fortunately I started
[374.36 - 378.88] getting associated with lot of Indian
[376.60 - 382.00] literature in Sanskrit so the radak
[378.88 - 384.36] Krishan P before you know the Chaka that
[382.00 - 387.36] happened to me I would say it was
[384.36 - 390.08] absolutely normal yet colorful life
[387.36 - 393.92] typical person whose parents from middle
[390.08 - 393.92] class kind of family would
[396.72 - 402.12] say in life but in my case it was
[399.96 - 404.20] absolutely different I worked in some
[402.12 - 406.72] glamorous Industries I worked in the
[404.20 - 408.64] cricket industry I worked in the jewelry
[406.72 - 411.88] industry I worked in the music industry
[408.64 - 414.20] Sports industry and then unfortunately
[411.88 - 416.60] you know that uh part of my life got
[414.20 - 419.16] over I became an entrepreneur an
[416.60 - 421.08] entrepreneur then fortunately I'm lucky
[419.16 - 423.12] that my my father-in-law and my wife
[421.08 - 424.48] also and mother-in-law agreed that even
[423.12 - 426.00] though it's an entrepreneur struggling
[424.48 - 428.24] he's worth
[426.00 - 430.92] marrying but then afterwards my thirst
[428.24 - 433.04] for knowledge never ended I continued my
[430.92 - 435.36] wife is a great supporter and that's
[433.04 - 437.36] when I said I want to run my company in
[435.36 - 438.88] a way that Indian companies would run
[437.36 - 441.36] traditionally because we were the
[438.88 - 442.60] richest part of the world it is not that
[441.36 - 444.68] you know we did not have management
[442.60 - 447.48] skills or we did not have wealth and
[444.68 - 449.60] therefore I discovered arastra arastra
[447.48 - 452.00] technically means the wealth of
[449.60 - 453.56] knowledge and the knowledge of wealth
[452.00 - 455.04] repeat that again the wealth of
[453.56 - 459.12] knowledge and the knowledge of wealth
[455.04 - 462.08] wealth so we in as India ancient we had
[459.12 - 464.48] a wealth of knowledge but currently we
[462.08 - 466.28] don't have knowledge of wealth is where
[464.48 - 469.28] we have a knowledge of wealth but it's
[466.28 - 470.68] very I would say than what absolutely
[469.28 - 472.80] sub we need to come out of that
[470.68 - 475.96] submissive and so let's understand our
[472.80 - 478.24] models yeah along with global models so
[475.96 - 480.12] today we cannot say I me myself we have
[478.24 - 482.36] connect we are living in interconnected
[480.12 - 484.24] world so what happens in one part of the
[482.36 - 485.52] world will definitely happen everywhere
[484.24 - 488.12] but at the same time you should know
[485.52 - 489.88] your traditional models also so India
[488.12 - 492.20] was the richest country in the world I
[489.88 - 494.04] started wondering how and then I found
[492.20 - 496.76] the answers in AR shastra That's What
[494.04 - 499.56] chak attracted me so I'm just pulling
[496.76 - 501.72] back to Sanskrit is it true that they
[499.56 - 504.00] say that Sanskrit is a very logical
[501.72 - 507.52] language and recently somebody wrote an
[504.00 - 509.16] article in the newspaper how if AI was
[507.52 - 510.12] applied to all the languages in the
[509.16 - 512.52] world
[510.12 - 515.40] Sanskrit would be the best medium to
[512.52 - 519.28] teach AI absolutely in fact I have a
[515.40 - 521.92] friend in I Bombay he actually has used
[519.28 - 523.76] Sanskrit as a programming language and
[521.92 - 525.00] he's got a presidential award also for
[523.76 - 527.96] that I think he's the guy who wrote the
[525.00 - 530.68] article only maybe so Sanskrit and
[527.96 - 533.80] chanakya and then marriage and then you
[530.68 - 536.76] did all of that and everything so you
[533.80 - 541.12] are known as a gentleman who guides
[536.76 - 543.80] people on in what I call a is the the
[541.12 - 546.08] vibrational plane or the brain plane or
[543.80 - 547.84] the meditation plane where did that get
[546.08 - 549.92] started before marriage after marriage
[547.84 - 551.36] what was the story right from the birth
[549.92 - 553.80] right from the birth because my father
[551.36 - 556.64] is a meditator and a meditation teacher
[553.80 - 559.20] also okay so for everyone listening in
[556.64 - 561.60] father was a meditation teacher and a
[559.20 - 564.60] meditation person himself I was born in
[561.60 - 567.44] the family of a yogi okay where my
[564.60 - 570.52] question lies is to get to the fastest
[567.44 - 573.08] place of meditation do I need to reborn
[570.52 - 575.60] to a father who's doing meditation or do
[573.08 - 578.20] I need to find a guru or I have
[575.60 - 579.96] 11-year-old child do I start meditating
[578.20 - 582.76] as a father and teach him so how
[579.96 - 585.76] important is it for parents to teach the
[582.76 - 588.08] Next Generation about the knowledge of
[585.76 - 590.04] anything so what is your journey with
[588.08 - 592.36] your father when you were born in the
[590.04 - 594.16] womb with this meditation please expand
[592.36 - 596.16] I think you answered the question
[594.16 - 599.36] rightly it is the parents who are to be
[596.16 - 601.60] Role Models this is saying in parenting
[599.36 - 603.96] children don't listen to you they will
[601.60 - 605.60] watch you so if you meditating they'll
[603.96 - 607.60] meditate if you're reading books they
[605.60 - 609.64] will do so did you watch your father
[607.60 - 611.20] meditate yes can you remember your
[609.64 - 612.80] earliest memory absolutely I still
[611.20 - 615.52] remember a fight between my father and
[612.80 - 617.16] mother and so it was very interesting
[615.52 - 618.60] this is not documented anywhere fight
[617.16 - 621.04] between father and mother now everyone's
[618.60 - 623.04] tuning every married couple should
[621.04 - 624.44] fight and that's the beauty of any
[623.04 - 626.12] relationship and you remembered that
[624.44 - 628.72] abolutely so what was the story so the
[626.12 - 631.20] story was an instance I still remember
[628.72 - 633.08] of course like any husband and wife they
[631.20 - 634.72] us to have their conversations and I'm
[633.08 - 637.04] sure you are listen to them without them
[634.72 - 638.68] knowing it also some of them so my
[637.04 - 640.68] mother used to always wonder this
[638.68 - 643.72] particular person my father used to
[640.68 - 645.92] meditate for 7 to 8 hours a day 7 to 8
[643.72 - 648.28] hours a day and remember I'm talking
[645.92 - 650.12] about a working day on Sundays or
[648.28 - 652.32] holidays used to make it for 12 14 hours
[650.12 - 652.32] a
[653.20 - 656.20] day
[656.52 - 660.96] absolutely so you know the conversation
[659.56 - 662.36] I heard was that you know she used to
[660.96 - 664.80] feel you know he's a very different
[662.36 - 666.84] person because other husbands of her
[664.80 - 668.60] friend Circle would be going out not
[666.84 - 670.68] that he never went out but it's very
[668.60 - 672.80] strange right for a person to sit down
[670.68 - 676.04] at the floor and meditate for so many
[672.80 - 678.68] hours and meditation or spiritual
[676.04 - 681.20] chanting to a god or something or just
[678.68 - 683.44] pure no thoughts so there are different
[681.20 - 686.68] schools of meditation he follows what is
[683.44 - 688.76] called as a vipasana meditation mhm and
[686.68 - 690.44] once in a year or twice in year he used
[688.76 - 693.76] to go for what is called The 10day
[690.44 - 696.12] Meditation Retreat and in that format
[693.76 - 697.48] you know Mantra chanting is not very
[696.12 - 699.40] much it's absolute
[697.48 - 701.24] silence I've had friends who have gone
[699.40 - 703.16] that and I'm like for 9 or 10 days you
[701.24 - 705.60] didn't speak to anyone how is that
[703.16 - 708.24] possible and they like it is possible
[705.60 - 710.00] once you connect inside absolutely in
[708.24 - 712.36] fact my father used to later on go for
[710.00 - 715.04] 45 days wow I'm sure your mother was not
[712.36 - 717.00] very pleased when he came back which was
[715.04 - 719.28] happy he was a great husband a great
[717.00 - 721.08] father but this were the kind of a
[719.28 - 723.56] background and ecosystem that I was born
[721.08 - 725.60] in did your mother ever meditate uh I
[723.56 - 728.80] think she was the bti person so for her
[725.60 - 731.52] Mantra chanting was the so we all have
[728.80 - 733.36] our own way of of meditation so you saw
[731.52 - 735.28] this first memory and what was your
[733.36 - 738.32] first memory of you beginning to start
[735.28 - 741.88] meditation my father pushed me so it's
[738.32 - 744.16] important that we push our children so
[741.88 - 747.28] like how my parents pushed me to study
[744.16 - 749.76] or I push my kid to do karate or go for
[747.28 - 751.24] yoga I think it's important right so I
[749.76 - 754.24] think it's very important to give them
[751.24 - 755.64] an exposure initially it can be pushing
[754.24 - 757.76] but after two three attempts if you
[755.64 - 759.88] don't enjoy it you'll come out in my
[757.76 - 761.72] case the initial push was there but
[759.88 - 763.76] after two three times it became part of
[761.72 - 765.96] me but if you had not pushed me I would
[763.76 - 767.72] have never got exposed to it so
[765.96 - 770.20] important for parents to direct the
[767.72 - 772.00] children into new learnings in life and
[770.20 - 774.92] I think it's the responsibility of the
[772.00 - 777.40] parent to also learn yes to be able to
[774.92 - 779.36] push the child into that new exposure
[777.40 - 780.92] okay so now we we're getting the story
[779.36 - 783.16] and how you are a guru of this
[780.92 - 784.56] meditation and your practice and all
[783.16 - 786.60] what's the best time of the day to
[784.56 - 789.52] meditate you know I'll tell you after a
[786.60 - 791.88] point at the highest level you go beyond
[789.52 - 794.24] time meditation is not about you know
[791.88 - 796.40] okay I medit for 2 minutes 1 minute 5
[794.24 - 799.20] minutes in the initial stages when
[796.40 - 801.32] you're taking baby steps those matter
[799.20 - 803.92] actually meditation is not a process
[801.32 - 807.08] it's a state of mind it's not a verb
[803.92 - 809.56] it's a noun H so that's the highest
[807.08 - 811.68] level but yes initially when you are a
[809.56 - 813.96] beginner in the field of meditation you
[811.68 - 816.48] can choose those hours where you you
[813.96 - 819.64] have less disturbance do you believe
[816.48 - 822.52] modern day technology distracts the mind
[819.64 - 825.24] to being focused and on a meditative
[822.52 - 827.24] state of being I believe the other way
[825.24 - 829.76] modern day technology is an asset for
[827.24 - 831.04] meditation please expand Dr so let me
[829.76 - 832.40] tell you if you're a beginner of
[831.04 - 834.84] meditation and let's say you don't have
[832.40 - 837.56] a physical Guru yet there's so many
[834.84 - 839.40] meditation apps so go for it but I'll
[837.56 - 841.36] tell you don't get distracted buy
[839.40 - 843.08] gadgets use gadgets so when you're
[841.36 - 845.32] meditating be consciously putting the
[843.08 - 848.36] mobile or the gadget off yeah so that's
[845.32 - 850.16] my problem okay so I'll put on an app
[848.36 - 851.64] and then a client will call and then
[850.16 - 853.12] wife will call and some and then
[851.64 - 855.08] suddenly you see an article on LinkedIn
[853.12 - 858.36] and so you get deviated so what your
[855.08 - 860.64] advising us is stick to the path using
[858.36 - 862.16] technology but try and control the
[860.64 - 865.32] filters and technology that don't
[862.16 - 867.84] distract you absolutely sagely advice
[865.32 - 869.64] from a modern day Guru okay so now I'm
[867.84 - 873.80] going to get into a little bit of a deep
[869.64 - 875.88] dive and more substance okay so Dr P
[873.80 - 878.76] what are the three most important
[875.88 - 881.12] qualities that still hold relevance from
[878.76 - 883.20] the ancient times today in the modern
[881.12 - 885.88] times that every individual needs to
[883.20 - 887.60] become or acquire to become successful
[885.88 - 890.16] in the current day lifestyle so I think
[887.60 - 892.00] for any success be it in the ancient
[890.16 - 894.32] world or today's world or the future
[892.00 - 896.52] world the three qualities that require
[894.32 - 899.40] for becoming successful in any field
[896.52 - 901.92] physically fit mentally alert and
[899.40 - 904.16] intellectually brilliant so let me
[901.92 - 905.52] explain that please understand even if
[904.16 - 906.96] you're on a spiritual journey you
[905.52 - 909.92] require a fit
[906.96 - 912.64] body yoga starts from there if you study
[909.92 - 916.16] the panjali yoga Sutra it starts with
[912.64 - 918.28] Yama Nama Asana pranayama so I think you
[916.16 - 920.80] are in that field making people
[918.28 - 923.64] physically fit but also mentally alert
[920.80 - 925.92] what is mental alertness remember a
[923.64 - 928.56] human being is a composition of not just
[925.92 - 931.24] the physical body but emotions and that
[928.56 - 932.68] could be both both negative and positive
[931.24 - 935.24] kindness
[932.68 - 937.04] love all this are positive kind of an
[935.24 - 940.20] emotion but negativity is also there
[937.04 - 942.40] fear guilt now if you're not mentally
[940.20 - 944.60] stable even if you are the most skillful
[942.40 - 947.08] person you can lose the game so mental
[944.60 - 949.16] alertness and that's comes from the high
[947.08 - 951.72] quality of meditation that you do a
[949.16 - 953.96] meditative person is aware of every
[951.72 - 956.44] thought that passes through his mind and
[953.96 - 958.48] an advanced Yogi can actually go into a
[956.44 - 960.36] state of no mind lot of people say you
[958.48 - 963.00] know mind is distracted that's the very
[960.36 - 965.52] nature of mind if the mind doesn't have
[963.00 - 967.84] thoughts then it's not mind but an
[965.52 - 970.12] advanced Yogi can decide when to think
[967.84 - 971.96] and when not to think that's powerful
[970.12 - 973.64] very powerful in fact there are states
[971.96 - 975.44] when people say okay for half an hour
[973.64 - 978.60] I'll not have a thought but in today's
[975.44 - 982.64] day and age of distraction phone rings
[978.60 - 984.56] this that TV Netflix yeah wo BB family
[982.64 - 986.04] how do you shut down so it it's a
[984.56 - 988.16] shutdown right it's like it's like
[986.04 - 990.80] putting your computer on hibernate mode
[988.16 - 992.96] you choose to press press the button so
[990.80 - 995.24] just expand a little bit more on this so
[992.96 - 997.32] there is two Sanskrit words for this to
[995.24 - 1000.32] become an expert in any field including
[997.32 - 1002.68] meditation one is called abhas practice
[1000.32 - 1004.16] and second is called waga Detachment so
[1002.68 - 1005.84] you'll be surprised there are thousands
[1004.16 - 1007.04] of sounds and there are thousands of
[1005.84 - 1009.16] things that you see every day but
[1007.04 - 1010.56] everything doesn't get attracted to you
[1009.16 - 1011.76] so let's say if you see a book and
[1010.56 - 1013.52] you're a book lover the book will
[1011.76 - 1015.20] attract you just besides the book there
[1013.52 - 1017.24] could be a toy you may not get attracted
[1015.20 - 1018.92] to the toy so it's very important that
[1017.24 - 1020.52] thoughts also are like that you'll be
[1018.92 - 1022.68] surprise you got thousands of thoughts
[1020.52 - 1024.72] but you don't recreate all thoughts so
[1022.68 - 1027.12] for example let's say to do a podcast
[1024.72 - 1029.80] and if you hear podcast for in my case
[1027.12 - 1032.60] Chaka whoever it is my mind will get
[1029.80 - 1034.76] attracted so the Mind Builds on certain
[1032.60 - 1037.08] thoughts and they don't get attracted to
[1034.76 - 1039.40] certain thoughts it's very important
[1037.08 - 1041.48] consciously you actually build these two
[1039.40 - 1043.48] qualities of constant practice you
[1041.48 - 1046.96] remember the first time we learned
[1043.48 - 1049.20] walking we never got attached to the
[1046.96 - 1050.64] failures have you ever remember you're
[1049.20 - 1052.44] going to your mother and say mommy
[1050.64 - 1056.36] please teach me walking the way you
[1052.44 - 1058.84] learned others failures are not your
[1056.36 - 1061.44] failures so it's very important you take
[1058.84 - 1064.24] your own Journey so every meditator
[1061.44 - 1066.52] actually has got his own Journey lot of
[1064.24 - 1069.28] people say I see light I see you know
[1066.52 - 1070.84] some Visions don't get carried away if
[1069.28 - 1073.56] you don't see don't feel bad some people
[1070.84 - 1075.24] listen to music it's okay how do you get
[1073.56 - 1076.96] you know this concentration level in a
[1075.24 - 1079.12] distracting World remember there are two
[1076.96 - 1082.00] three tips for this the first one is is
[1079.12 - 1085.16] that control technology let not
[1082.00 - 1087.04] technology control you I'm a great fan
[1085.16 - 1088.96] of technology in fact I believe in the
[1087.04 - 1091.12] best gadgets I invest in the best
[1088.96 - 1093.12] gadgets and I feel that's a great
[1091.12 - 1094.56] blessing for Our Generation it can
[1093.12 - 1095.88] connect you to any part of the world in
[1094.56 - 1098.60] a split of a
[1095.88 - 1101.28] second but at the same time let's say
[1098.60 - 1103.44] you know I am not having technology I
[1101.28 - 1106.28] still have the human mind and that's
[1103.44 - 1108.20] where intellectual Brilliance comes in
[1106.28 - 1109.92] so let me give an example I was doing a
[1108.20 - 1111.96] training program with the Indian armed
[1109.92 - 1114.36] forces and they're very particular you
[1111.96 - 1117.20] know very specific time every second
[1114.36 - 1119.48] matters to them because the armed forces
[1117.20 - 1121.36] the mistake of a minc is a matter of
[1119.48 - 1123.00] life and death life and death yes and I
[1121.36 - 1125.64] still remember you know we had set up
[1123.00 - 1127.80] the all laptop PowerPoint presentations
[1125.64 - 1130.32] and all and as you know technology can
[1127.80 - 1132.24] fail any moment and they so worried
[1130.32 - 1134.20] because you know I was on the stage and
[1132.24 - 1136.40] the technology was not working you know
[1134.20 - 1138.12] what I told them let's start the lecture
[1136.40 - 1140.12] sir the PPT we are setting it up give us
[1138.12 - 1143.20] 5 minutes after 5 minutes I told them
[1140.12 - 1144.16] remember the pp may not work but I'm
[1143.20 - 1146.24] there still
[1144.16 - 1148.48] working and therefore I always say that
[1146.24 - 1150.28] you know please understand technology as
[1148.48 - 1152.92] a distraction if you're getting too much
[1150.28 - 1155.40] dependent on it but technology has a
[1152.92 - 1156.88] asset if you can use it other thing is
[1155.40 - 1158.76] that are you disciplined with
[1156.88 - 1161.80] distractions so I'll give a simple
[1158.76 - 1164.80] example today a phone a mobile phone is
[1161.80 - 1166.96] not just a phone it's a communicator of
[1164.80 - 1169.08] social media you have so many apps there
[1166.96 - 1171.24] a WhatsApp maybe you have have a
[1169.08 - 1174.20] LinkedIn maybe you have you know an
[1171.24 - 1176.16] Instagram or whatever YouTube now thing
[1174.20 - 1178.72] is that let's say you have a thought you
[1176.16 - 1180.76] to call up your family member a wife a
[1178.72 - 1184.08] friend or somebody you know now you pick
[1180.76 - 1186.00] up the phone to actually call your call
[1184.08 - 1187.16] somebody what do you do get distracted
[1186.00 - 1188.76] to something first you go to the
[1187.16 - 1191.08] WhatsApp then you have this problem
[1188.76 - 1192.48] called foro fear of missing out can you
[1191.08 - 1194.48] be disciplined saying that I will look
[1192.48 - 1196.36] at the WhatsApp nothing wrong I mean you
[1194.48 - 1198.16] should use the WhatsApp but thing that
[1196.36 - 1200.16] can you consciously say no I picked up
[1198.16 - 1201.60] the phone for making a call let me
[1200.16 - 1203.00] complete the call and then come back to
[1201.60 - 1204.76] Whatsapp but when you look at the
[1203.00 - 1207.44] WhatsApp after 3 4 messages you suddenly
[1204.76 - 1209.68] realize why did I pick up this phone so
[1207.44 - 1211.24] that's distraction without discipline I
[1209.68 - 1212.96] know people who are very disciplined
[1211.24 - 1215.12] with their mobile very disciplined and
[1212.96 - 1217.08] let me tell you about myself I reply to
[1215.12 - 1219.16] at least 500 messages on Whatsapp
[1217.08 - 1221.32] personally every day I reply back to
[1219.16 - 1223.04] every single mail I reply back to every
[1221.32 - 1225.52] single call but that doesn't mean you
[1223.04 - 1227.36] know I'm a addict to them but I say okay
[1225.52 - 1229.28] there's a time okay if I can't take it
[1227.36 - 1231.12] I'll take it later on so it's very
[1229.28 - 1233.12] important in a distracted World be
[1231.12 - 1235.52] disciplined and you'll use the benefit
[1233.12 - 1237.36] of your mind being active and also
[1235.52 - 1239.84] technology that can be helped I think
[1237.36 - 1242.12] whatever you're saying from me as a
[1239.84 - 1245.08] nutritionist holds at the same plane of
[1242.12 - 1248.28] level if I replace technology with
[1245.08 - 1250.12] eating wow don't be distracted I know
[1248.28 - 1253.68] you need to know what is your goal so
[1250.12 - 1256.64] these are really ancient words of wisdom
[1253.68 - 1258.88] which are so practical and so common
[1256.64 - 1260.80] sense but sometimes we forget to connect
[1258.88 - 1263.76] the dots you know speaking of connecting
[1260.80 - 1265.76] the dots and you said this earlier that
[1263.76 - 1267.32] when you're in a place and you see a
[1265.76 - 1269.56] book and you have a love of reading and
[1267.32 - 1271.48] there's a toy next to it your focus your
[1269.56 - 1274.56] razor sharp Focus or your thought
[1271.48 - 1277.08] process takes you towards the book now I
[1274.56 - 1279.44] love to read and they say that all
[1277.08 - 1281.80] readers are leaders it's a very famous
[1279.44 - 1283.96] quote what is your opinion of developing
[1281.80 - 1286.44] the habit of reading and I think today
[1283.96 - 1288.84] podcasting is a new form of reading uh
[1286.44 - 1290.92] video making is a new form of uh reading
[1288.84 - 1293.44] video editing is a new form of reading
[1290.92 - 1295.80] so do you feel this concept of
[1293.44 - 1298.20] intellectual stimulation is important to
[1295.80 - 1299.96] become a successful leader 100% an
[1298.20 - 1301.88] intellectual stimulation can happen
[1299.96 - 1304.32] through different methods even though
[1301.88 - 1306.00] I'm a writer I say books are only one
[1304.32 - 1307.80] form of knowledge you mentioned about
[1306.00 - 1309.92] podcast there are so many videos coming
[1307.80 - 1312.24] out now and maybe tomorrow it could be
[1309.92 - 1313.88] using AI maybe they'll clone you I don't
[1312.24 - 1315.72] have to be physically present but the
[1313.88 - 1317.48] thing is that don't get carried out by
[1315.72 - 1319.68] the glamour part of it lot of people
[1317.48 - 1321.60] have this habit of you buying the book
[1319.68 - 1323.88] Because of its cover and title people
[1321.60 - 1325.44] actually do that yeah they do people go
[1323.88 - 1328.60] to movies because there's a great star
[1325.44 - 1330.16] in it I mean intellectually you say okay
[1328.60 - 1332.36] I like a great star but what's the
[1330.16 - 1334.44] content so what's very important is that
[1332.36 - 1336.32] today it's a generation of over
[1334.44 - 1337.96] information and intellectually you
[1336.32 - 1340.00] should be able to dissect what is called
[1337.96 - 1341.80] in an ancient culture called a via
[1340.00 - 1344.28] buddhi so I can consume a lot of things
[1341.80 - 1346.20] free but is it having any nutrition for
[1344.28 - 1348.88] my intellect wow powerful words
[1346.20 - 1351.52] nutrition value for my intellect so so
[1348.88 - 1354.32] when leaders have to read how do they
[1351.52 - 1356.72] know what to consume do we rely on the
[1354.32 - 1359.88] ancient wisdom that you're attracted to
[1356.72 - 1361.44] it or what are your words of wisdom so I
[1359.88 - 1364.76] tell you all leaders have one common
[1361.44 - 1366.92] problem time management true if you're a
[1364.76 - 1369.04] leader you always have this as the
[1366.92 - 1371.60] biggest problem time management so I'll
[1369.04 - 1373.72] tell you how to manage time with books
[1371.60 - 1375.24] because books can take away a lot of
[1373.72 - 1376.48] your time and especially when you're
[1375.24 - 1377.96] reading a book you don't want to get
[1376.48 - 1381.16] distracted so I'll tell you there are
[1377.96 - 1383.52] lot of sec in fact which maybe I do
[1381.16 - 1385.52] write on these topics also so I'll tell
[1383.52 - 1387.44] you a simple thing never read a book if
[1385.52 - 1389.56] it doesn't interest you just because to
[1387.44 - 1391.32] read a book be very choosy about the
[1389.56 - 1393.56] books you read Because books can make
[1391.32 - 1395.72] you or break you interesting so I just
[1393.56 - 1397.72] want to read it's okay and it's like you
[1395.72 - 1399.28] know what's your main meal course and
[1397.72 - 1401.16] then what's your supplementary like you
[1399.28 - 1402.96] know pickle is not a main course that's
[1401.16 - 1404.76] just for taste you know a desert is not
[1402.96 - 1407.00] your main course but that's you know end
[1404.76 - 1408.84] with the sweet now think about it what's
[1407.00 - 1410.68] your main course so if let's say you're
[1408.84 - 1412.68] a leader and you are leading let's say
[1410.68 - 1414.16] the Armed Forces you can be corporate
[1412.68 - 1415.92] leader you can be a political leader you
[1414.16 - 1417.60] can be a scientific leader so I think
[1415.92 - 1419.16] you have to be very focused that if I'm
[1417.60 - 1420.88] Armed Force leader I will read a lot of
[1419.16 - 1422.44] books on the Army leadership and by the
[1420.88 - 1424.76] way there are thousands of books on that
[1422.44 - 1426.96] for a change you can read a poem you can
[1424.76 - 1428.96] read a book on maybe some non-fiction or
[1426.96 - 1430.40] fiction book that's okay but your core
[1428.96 - 1432.96] subject so I think it's very important
[1430.40 - 1435.36] to choose your field like for me I read
[1432.96 - 1436.48] I read more than 400 books on chanaka
[1435.36 - 1439.08] but that doesn't mean I only read
[1436.48 - 1443.00] chanaka so the concept is 8020
[1439.08 - 1444.56] 80% read what is your subject 20% to
[1443.00 - 1447.36] other subjects otherwise you'll only get
[1444.56 - 1449.92] one-sided so I read a lot of Chaka and
[1447.36 - 1452.48] some other stuff also so speaking of the
[1449.92 - 1455.08] other stuff and all uh what does your
[1452.48 - 1457.32] daily routine look like when you're not
[1455.08 - 1458.84] traveling what are this other 20% that
[1457.32 - 1461.16] you're looking at and there's something
[1458.84 - 1463.40] known as the din Chara your routine how
[1461.16 - 1465.84] did you master this what is your day
[1463.40 - 1468.04] like give us insights into your life
[1465.84 - 1470.96] which maybe the youngsters out there who
[1468.04 - 1473.56] are listening in or watching in can get
[1470.96 - 1475.92] some sort of crystallization what does a
[1473.56 - 1477.64] meditation guru's day look like so I'll
[1475.92 - 1479.88] tell you for everyone especially
[1477.64 - 1480.92] youngsters remember you'll never be
[1479.88 - 1482.96] young
[1480.92 - 1485.28] forever there'll come a time will you
[1482.96 - 1488.28] have a family you'll have more
[1485.28 - 1491.48] responsibilities but my Dinara is what
[1488.28 - 1494.44] Chaka suggested in the AR shastra have a
[1491.48 - 1496.96] plan and go with the flow have a plan
[1494.44 - 1498.56] and go with the flow okay expound please
[1496.96 - 1500.44] yeah so you should have a timable I'll
[1498.56 - 1501.92] get up at this particular time I'll do
[1500.44 - 1503.56] this this routine work I'll tell you how
[1501.92 - 1505.44] I do it at my life but never become
[1503.56 - 1507.44] rigid because you're living with others
[1505.44 - 1509.52] there's an emergency you can't say no no
[1507.44 - 1511.20] it's time for meditation your mother has
[1509.52 - 1513.00] to be rushed to hospital you can't say
[1511.20 - 1514.28] it's my time meditation time so you
[1513.00 - 1516.52] should know this because we live in a
[1514.28 - 1519.28] society now coming back how do you plan
[1516.52 - 1522.40] I'll tell you I plan my my personal life
[1519.28 - 1524.68] into four quarters in a day okay because
[1522.40 - 1526.28] I'm married I have children so my four
[1524.68 - 1529.04] quarters first thing in the morning
[1526.28 - 1531.20] which I get up by 5 5:30 even before the
[1529.04 - 1534.36] others wake up and even before the sun
[1531.20 - 1536.64] wakes up or sun rises this called me
[1534.36 - 1539.16] time that's my meditation time I study
[1536.64 - 1542.28] in the mornings my scriptures I go for a
[1539.16 - 1545.60] walk my regular exercises you can you
[1542.28 - 1547.08] meditate during a walk yes it's possible
[1545.60 - 1550.16] absolutely I can meditate when I am
[1547.08 - 1552.36] driving also and this takes practice
[1550.16 - 1555.00] does take practice and where would
[1552.36 - 1558.84] somebody start uh sitting quietly for 1
[1555.00 - 1561.24] minute a day 1 minute let's all start
[1558.84 - 1563.68] by stating a comment below on this
[1561.24 - 1566.04] podcast I am going to start meditating
[1563.68 - 1568.04] one minute a day we'll ask Dr P how to
[1566.04 - 1570.24] start with 1 minute but let's commit to
[1568.04 - 1571.88] 1 minute a day so you're in you're
[1570.24 - 1574.48] you're going walking in the morning
[1571.88 - 1576.72] that's one compartment of your day then
[1574.48 - 1578.96] so that's the morning me time but when I
[1576.72 - 1581.56] come back then you know I never read a
[1578.96 - 1583.96] newspaper or any WhatsApp message till
[1581.56 - 1586.16] 8:00 in the morning don't touch your
[1583.96 - 1587.52] phone till 8:00 or like 3 hours you're
[1586.16 - 1590.80] already awake don't touch because we
[1587.52 - 1593.08] need to get the me time and this not
[1590.80 - 1594.32] touching the phone is what philosophy so
[1593.08 - 1595.84] I'll tell you what because as you
[1594.32 - 1597.92] rightly pointed out the mind can get
[1595.84 - 1600.04] distracted you know the first thing I do
[1597.92 - 1602.04] in the morning after all my me time
[1600.04 - 1604.12] after get ready I do my meditations and
[1602.04 - 1605.20] everything all my spiritual activities I
[1604.12 - 1608.84] read a
[1605.20 - 1610.52] newspaper 8:00 sharp to 8:30 I'm reading
[1608.84 - 1613.48] the whole newspaper I don't read it word
[1610.52 - 1615.88] by word but I get the essence AA Modi
[1613.48 - 1618.40] has done that Ukraine problem and you'll
[1615.88 - 1620.16] be surprised you'll be surprised
[1618.40 - 1622.08] WhatsApp is just picking up from there
[1620.16 - 1623.56] so before the WhatsApp message comes in
[1622.08 - 1626.36] I know what's going to come in the
[1623.56 - 1628.52] WhatsApp generally good morning messages
[1626.36 - 1630.68] and all now comes what is called my
[1628.52 - 1632.08] professional time okay so after 8:00 you
[1630.68 - 1634.64] know you start planning your day you
[1632.08 - 1637.36] have to go and have meetings etc etc
[1634.64 - 1639.44] till 8:00 even a family generally is in
[1637.36 - 1641.24] a very low their own me times they're
[1639.44 - 1643.96] getting ready for the day children have
[1641.24 - 1646.08] to go to school life has to make sure of
[1643.96 - 1647.84] the kitchen activities my father parents
[1646.08 - 1649.36] everything so I think that's the time
[1647.84 - 1651.20] you should yourself and don't disturb
[1649.36 - 1653.52] others now that's very important if you
[1651.20 - 1655.28] want people to respect your time please
[1653.52 - 1657.08] respect their time lot of people who
[1655.28 - 1659.08] want personal time disturb others
[1657.08 - 1660.72] personal times so that's the first thing
[1659.08 - 1663.36] professional time of course the day is
[1660.72 - 1666.92] very active where probably you know I do
[1663.36 - 1668.44] a lot of meetings podcast training
[1666.92 - 1670.28] programs and as you said you know
[1668.44 - 1672.44] sometimes out of Bombay also but I try
[1670.28 - 1675.08] and do it within the limits where are
[1672.44 - 1677.88] possible now comes the fourth box of my
[1675.08 - 1680.00] day called family time once I'm back
[1677.88 - 1684.20] home I'm absolutely
[1680.00 - 1684.20] normal my wife always jokes you
[1685.12 - 1690.16] know or
[1687.80 - 1691.68] chak because at the whole world you may
[1690.16 - 1693.96] be known but at the home you have to be
[1691.68 - 1695.92] absolutely normal I listen to my
[1693.96 - 1698.36] children I learned from them what they
[1695.92 - 1700.00] learned in the school and I learned from
[1698.36 - 1701.64] what my wife's experiences were my
[1700.00 - 1703.32] parents experiences were there and the
[1701.64 - 1705.04] fourth quarter which is very important
[1703.32 - 1706.84] for me and it is not a fixed quarter but
[1705.04 - 1709.04] throughout the day when I get gaps that
[1706.84 - 1711.36] is called reading time it can be also
[1709.04 - 1713.64] podcast time so for me there four things
[1711.36 - 1715.80] I do in every day balancing it out me
[1713.64 - 1717.84] time spiritual time what is called
[1715.80 - 1719.88] professional Time family time and what
[1717.84 - 1721.92] we call it research or reading time so
[1719.88 - 1724.24] these are the way I generally plan out
[1721.92 - 1726.36] and it works out well so you know we
[1724.24 - 1728.88] talked about these four zones in your
[1726.36 - 1731.36] life and it seems that you do a lot of
[1728.88 - 1733.48] multitasking but you have these zones
[1731.36 - 1735.60] now they say that all successful people
[1733.48 - 1737.68] multitask and multitask is not about
[1735.60 - 1739.40] doing 100 things at the same time but
[1737.68 - 1742.20] it's about doing one thing focused
[1739.40 - 1744.88] multiplied by 100 times can you discuss
[1742.20 - 1748.32] after these four zones how that
[1744.88 - 1750.08] essential time management is required
[1748.32 - 1751.68] for a person to become successful in
[1750.08 - 1753.68] life now it's indicative that you said
[1751.68 - 1756.36] you have these four zones but what are
[1753.68 - 1758.64] some of the secrets of your success in
[1756.36 - 1761.08] this multitasking and busy life that you
[1758.64 - 1763.68] have thank you that's where chaka's
[1761.08 - 1765.88] analysis comes in okay so you know
[1763.68 - 1768.24] mentally I have developed a interesting
[1765.88 - 1770.36] skill called us what's the priority now
[1768.24 - 1772.12] what's the priority now it's a very
[1770.36 - 1773.80] interesting skill to have you can have
[1772.12 - 1776.40] multiple things coming to you but you
[1773.80 - 1779.20] can only do one at a time this is seeing
[1776.40 - 1781.12] if you try to catch two birds at the
[1779.20 - 1783.32] same time you'll be neither able to
[1781.12 - 1785.44] catch either of them but that doesn't
[1783.32 - 1787.24] mean I want both the birds but let me
[1785.44 - 1788.96] hunt one the other will follow so
[1787.24 - 1790.48] mentally you need to prioritize for
[1788.96 - 1792.72] example if you look at your WhatsApp
[1790.48 - 1794.08] messages let's say you open up there 100
[1792.72 - 1795.92] messages but you know there is something
[1794.08 - 1797.60] called pinning the top three can be
[1795.92 - 1799.24] pinned so what I do is basically
[1797.60 - 1801.12] whenever any thought comes to me maybe a
[1799.24 - 1802.52] phone call comes to me I prioritize
[1801.12 - 1804.56] saying that is it to be replied right
[1802.52 - 1806.52] now yes do it no I can't do it in the
[1804.56 - 1808.40] evening you'll be surprised many times
[1806.52 - 1810.56] people get addicted to just lifting up
[1808.40 - 1812.44] phones and the thought that I can give
[1810.56 - 1814.44] back a reply because already most of
[1812.44 - 1815.96] your cell phones have a call back option
[1814.44 - 1817.52] right the thing is that why are we so
[1815.96 - 1819.56] addicted that every time a thought comes
[1817.52 - 1821.64] and have to entertain it our
[1819.56 - 1823.32] grandparents if they wanted to meet up
[1821.64 - 1825.36] with each other they wrote a love letter
[1823.32 - 1828.00] that reach three months later yeah and
[1825.36 - 1830.96] today it's like you're addicted to a
[1828.00 - 1833.04] imate response which is I'm 10 seconds
[1830.96 - 1834.84] away but please wait for me to come so
[1833.04 - 1836.80] what you're saying to me to crystallize
[1834.84 - 1839.16] it for our audience is that in this
[1836.80 - 1841.68] world of multitasking have this one
[1839.16 - 1844.88] thought in your head what is my priority
[1841.68 - 1847.32] right now okay so nice words of wisdom
[1844.88 - 1849.04] and in speaking of wisdom want to just
[1847.32 - 1851.72] rewind a little bit back and you talked
[1849.04 - 1854.44] about your father and having a lot of
[1851.72 - 1857.00] wisdom to you and then the meditation
[1854.44 - 1858.80] that he did and the form of meditation
[1857.00 - 1861.28] uh was vipasana
[1858.80 - 1864.64] can you Enlighten us on the significance
[1861.28 - 1868.48] of this vipasana meditation and why have
[1864.64 - 1871.48] you chosen it as your conduit or your
[1868.48 - 1874.24] passion or your journey so give a little
[1871.48 - 1876.52] bit background about vasana it was
[1874.24 - 1879.80] technique of meditation taught by Lord
[1876.52 - 1882.08] gutam Buddha himself but interestingly
[1879.80 - 1884.92] what happened is that it knowledge was
[1882.08 - 1888.24] lost for many generations it was more
[1884.92 - 1891.56] popular outside India is it yeah yeah
[1888.24 - 1893.40] and a great uh I would say Saint in the
[1891.56 - 1896.08] previous generation his name was goink
[1893.40 - 1898.24] Kaji he was known as a founder of vasana
[1896.08 - 1900.16] he was born in BMA can you believe
[1898.24 - 1903.28] vipasana was a practice in BMA which
[1900.16 - 1904.80] came back to India wow what is vasana
[1903.28 - 1906.84] it's a technique of meditation there are
[1904.80 - 1909.52] many techniques like modern day we have
[1906.84 - 1912.32] a lot of gurus also like sish Shankar
[1909.52 - 1913.92] speaks about and teaches Sudan kria Kaa
[1912.32 - 1915.96] yoga lot of things I will not go into
[1913.92 - 1918.88] that coming back to vipasana it starts
[1915.96 - 1921.52] with the basic step which everybody can
[1918.88 - 1923.48] practice called as anaana which means
[1921.52 - 1925.88] watching a breath it comes in it goes
[1923.48 - 1927.84] out that's it do nothing interestingly
[1925.88 - 1930.12] to breathe we don't require efforts but
[1927.84 - 1931.84] we don't know how to watch our breath in
[1930.12 - 1934.12] fact in the Buddhist culture when you
[1931.84 - 1936.00] become a m the first exercise is to just
[1934.12 - 1938.24] sit down and watch your breath and
[1936.00 - 1940.64] believe me it's not easy it's not easy I
[1938.24 - 1942.28] try and do it with my yoga instructor
[1940.64 - 1945.12] and I'm gone to Disney World in the
[1942.28 - 1949.24] third breath so now I'm getting the
[1945.12 - 1951.44] significance anaana means the in and out
[1949.24 - 1954.12] so all we have to start doing is that
[1951.44 - 1957.00] one minute that you're asking us to sit
[1954.12 - 1958.56] down and meditate and in one minute can
[1957.00 - 1959.60] we focus on our breath is this the
[1958.56 - 1961.56] advice you're giving absolutely
[1959.60 - 1962.88] absolutely awesome so continue on your
[1961.56 - 1965.20] vasana the
[1962.88 - 1967.48] significance afterwards it doesn't stop
[1965.20 - 1970.52] with that please understand you're
[1967.48 - 1972.80] watching a breath Second Step many yogis
[1970.52 - 1974.68] do a different practice then is called
[1972.80 - 1976.20] they have to regulate the breath lot of
[1974.68 - 1977.84] people who start from meditation start
[1976.20 - 1979.44] to regulate the breath don't do that
[1977.84 - 1981.24] watch your breath for example in your
[1979.44 - 1983.08] field of nutrition you first study the
[1981.24 - 1985.00] patient what is the condition right now
[1983.08 - 1987.16] correct then you change the diet plan
[1985.00 - 1988.64] towards Health you don't just go say
[1987.16 - 1990.44] this is the diet plan follow it right
[1988.64 - 1992.80] now so people don't know how to was
[1990.44 - 1995.92] their breath they get into pranayama
[1992.80 - 1998.16] directly oh oh so this is a real
[1995.92 - 2000.12] interesting Insight don't try and teach
[1998.16 - 2001.36] 10th standard syllabus before you learn
[2000.12 - 2003.84] the first standard syllabus and the
[2001.36 - 2005.96] first standard syllabus is watch your
[2003.84 - 2008.12] breath and you can do it 24 hours if
[2005.96 - 2009.64] you're alert while walking on Al you can
[2008.12 - 2011.80] watch your breath oh so when you go on
[2009.64 - 2013.36] your morning walk I can watch my breath
[2011.80 - 2015.52] or if I'm driving the car I can watch my
[2013.36 - 2017.68] breath absolutely that and that brings
[2015.52 - 2020.12] you in a quality called as awareness see
[2017.68 - 2022.36] beinging alert and aware and Vigilant is
[2020.12 - 2024.00] a first step for spiritual life imagine
[2022.36 - 2025.88] you start with your breath you can later
[2024.00 - 2027.72] on watch your thoughts and you can
[2025.88 - 2029.52] dissect them it's like watching a movie
[2027.72 - 2031.24] you're not involved but you are watching
[2029.52 - 2034.00] it and you can say it's a good actor a
[2031.24 - 2036.12] bad actor there's a good noise there's a
[2034.00 - 2038.40] bad noise there is a nice music this
[2036.12 - 2040.20] music includes flute It Go go to a level
[2038.40 - 2042.68] it's not just music you're going to what
[2040.20 - 2045.76] is called barik so I work with a lot of
[2042.68 - 2048.56] athletes a lot of athletes and they
[2045.76 - 2050.76] practice really hard what's a good ball
[2048.56 - 2053.72] what's a bad ball they practice it to
[2050.76 - 2055.68] read it so I think for us the arm admy
[2053.72 - 2058.56] the non-athlete the general people we
[2055.68 - 2060.76] need to start practicing watching our
[2058.56 - 2062.28] breath watching our thoughts I think
[2060.76 - 2065.24] that's something that we take for
[2062.28 - 2067.44] granted start with your mental gym start
[2065.24 - 2069.08] with your mental gym I'm going to write
[2067.44 - 2071.28] that down this is going to be like the
[2069.08 - 2074.12] most important thing start with your
[2071.28 - 2075.56] mental gym it starts with a breath so
[2074.12 - 2078.00] we're breathing and we're going to the
[2075.56 - 2080.80] gym but there are no weights being
[2078.00 - 2082.64] lifted I think that's an even more
[2080.80 - 2084.92] difficult weight to lift it seems easy
[2082.64 - 2087.40] one minute a day try remember it's not 1
[2084.92 - 2089.72] minute it's 60 seconds you never know
[2087.40 - 2091.32] how much you can gather mental strength
[2089.72 - 2093.96] by just watching a breath do it
[2091.32 - 2096.12] consciously start by sitting down but do
[2093.96 - 2098.64] it every day little bit more and you'll
[2096.12 - 2100.60] be surprised 1 to 2 minutes to 5 minutes
[2098.64 - 2102.20] later on you can do it for 1 hour also
[2100.60 - 2104.44] don't start with 1 hour you'll break
[2102.20 - 2106.36] down as a meditation coach as a
[2104.44 - 2110.00] meditation Guru you know I get this
[2106.36 - 2112.28] question is Diet follow right so the
[2110.00 - 2115.40] question over here is what I feel is
[2112.28 - 2118.56] people in the world do not do something
[2115.40 - 2122.36] unless it becomes a fashion or they are
[2118.56 - 2125.48] significantly convinced to do that new
[2122.36 - 2127.72] set of skills you are telling chanaka
[2125.48 - 2130.16] did this there's a manual you have done
[2127.72 - 2133.08] meditation vas's ancient from Goa and
[2130.16 - 2136.44] all of that stuff is there some hook or
[2133.08 - 2139.36] story or Revelation or statistic that we
[2136.44 - 2142.44] can give the listeners that may convince
[2139.36 - 2145.16] them to do meditation sure there is a
[2142.44 - 2146.96] saying that if you want to cut a tree
[2145.16 - 2149.52] you should have the acts been sharpened
[2146.96 - 2151.44] from time to time correct meditation is
[2149.52 - 2153.60] that sharpening of the mind that you
[2151.44 - 2155.16] require because you work with the world
[2153.60 - 2156.76] with your mind so you're working in the
[2155.16 - 2158.16] world you're not actually working with
[2156.76 - 2160.60] your hands and feet you're working with
[2158.16 - 2162.72] your mind and the more educated you are
[2160.60 - 2164.24] you're expected to be more intelligent
[2162.72 - 2165.96] but intelligence is not just about
[2164.24 - 2167.64] reading books or gathering more
[2165.96 - 2170.04] information I was about to go to that
[2167.64 - 2171.80] because like I asked you know readers
[2170.04 - 2174.96] are leaders so you just buy all the
[2171.80 - 2176.96] books keep it read it but is the book
[2174.96 - 2178.96] acquisition of book actually sharpening
[2176.96 - 2180.68] of the acts because I'm going with
[2178.96 - 2182.56] thought and breath over here in the
[2180.68 - 2185.04] meditation Department forgive me if I'm
[2182.56 - 2187.32] wrong over here it's the most laziest
[2185.04 - 2189.48] thing that I have to ask my body to do
[2187.32 - 2192.44] because anyway thought is there anywh
[2189.48 - 2194.76] breath is there why should I refine it
[2192.44 - 2196.36] because anyway I'm breathing anyway I'm
[2194.76 - 2199.44] thinking how does it make me a better
[2196.36 - 2201.44] human so two things here in meditation
[2199.44 - 2203.44] the awareness is not there anywh I'm
[2201.44 - 2204.88] breathing yeah I don't require to be
[2203.44 - 2206.56] aware of my breathing but why do I need
[2204.88 - 2208.16] to be aware of my breathing because
[2206.56 - 2210.96] there is a connection between the breath
[2208.16 - 2213.16] and the mind okay okay so let me tell
[2210.96 - 2216.08] you the two words in English one is
[2213.16 - 2220.28] called Mind m i n d just reverse the
[2216.08 - 2221.92] word m to w it becomes wind the mind and
[2220.28 - 2224.40] the wind are connected so you want to
[2221.92 - 2225.92] control the mind control your breath and
[2224.40 - 2227.68] if you control your breath you control
[2225.92 - 2229.32] the mind so they interconnected they two
[2227.68 - 2233.24] sides of the same so the breath is the
[2229.32 - 2235.88] wind yes and why it's important is that
[2233.24 - 2238.92] after stage of life especially leaders
[2235.88 - 2242.60] leaders don't work like workers it's a
[2238.92 - 2245.92] saying I heard workers work managers
[2242.60 - 2248.44] manage leaders lead but the question is
[2245.92 - 2251.40] where do future so so leaders have a
[2248.44 - 2253.48] thinking job that's so brilliant I had
[2251.40 - 2256.04] goosebumps just now I had amazing
[2253.48 - 2259.48] Goosebumps and I'll tell you why I had a
[2256.04 - 2262.08] mentor in my previous company and I us
[2259.48 - 2264.96] to always take my laptop and go into his
[2262.08 - 2267.68] cabin so he used to tell me take this
[2264.96 - 2270.04] Dabba out and this gentleman was 75
[2267.68 - 2272.32] years old as a mentor and I would get
[2270.04 - 2274.28] angry as a youngster what do you mean
[2272.32 - 2275.88] this dubba this dubba is the future it's
[2274.28 - 2278.76] going to change the way the world works
[2275.88 - 2281.36] and everything but I got goosebumps now
[2278.76 - 2283.48] because of what you just said we need to
[2281.36 - 2284.96] control the thought but before you
[2283.48 - 2287.20] control the thought you need to think
[2284.96 - 2289.32] you need to be aware of your thinking so
[2287.20 - 2292.24] by me taking in that Dabba which was my
[2289.32 - 2294.84] laptop in I was not allowing my mind to
[2292.24 - 2297.08] do the thinking I was trying to distract
[2294.84 - 2300.12] myself at I'm doing thinking because the
[2297.08 - 2302.44] Dabba is giving me the thinking right so
[2300.12 - 2306.28] I just got goosebumps because of that
[2302.44 - 2308.16] wow wow talking about Goosebumps my
[2306.28 - 2310.96] department is food I'm going to be a
[2308.16 - 2312.68] little bit cheeky over here do you think
[2310.96 - 2315.20] food plays an important role in
[2312.68 - 2319.56] medication no it plays a very important
[2315.20 - 2321.72] role very important Ro okay so tell me
[2319.56 - 2323.28] what is your Deep dive on the very
[2321.72 - 2326.12] important with regards to food actually
[2323.28 - 2327.84] you're the guru for me in that space But
[2326.12 - 2330.52] my understanding if you are sitting for
[2327.84 - 2332.68] meditation two things don't overeat
[2330.52 - 2334.60] don't undereat the nutrition value maybe
[2332.68 - 2337.12] you can you know teach me better if you
[2334.60 - 2339.44] ovat you can fall to sleep because your
[2337.12 - 2342.28] energy goes into digestion if you don't
[2339.44 - 2346.16] eat you'll be thinking about
[2342.28 - 2348.88] food is it true that somebody went into
[2346.16 - 2351.44] very deep meditation and used food as
[2348.88 - 2353.52] the one connect with this worldly word
[2351.44 - 2356.96] to come back yeah what was that story
[2353.52 - 2359.80] was Swami via's Guru Ram Krishna param
[2356.96 - 2362.00] but remember he a PhD level he not the
[2359.80 - 2363.76] first standard second standard you know
[2362.00 - 2367.08] this highest stage of meditation is
[2363.76 - 2369.64] called as samadi samadi and even that
[2367.08 - 2372.28] this is stage called NPA samadi okay
[2369.64 - 2375.76] you're in that stage for you know a long
[2372.28 - 2377.40] period of time and you have no thoughts
[2375.76 - 2379.68] imagine you'll never come back from that
[2377.40 - 2381.24] state and because he was in a living
[2379.68 - 2383.40] body like you and me you know he was
[2381.24 - 2385.80] aware that if he goes into that state he
[2383.40 - 2387.72] the Trans State he may not come back a
[2385.80 - 2389.68] lot of saints across the globe in
[2387.72 - 2391.72] different cultures have been known to go
[2389.68 - 2393.96] into trans and totally get disconnected
[2391.72 - 2395.56] from the world remember they're not dead
[2393.96 - 2397.40] but you don't feel they're active now
[2395.56 - 2399.32] what happens that common man can get
[2397.40 - 2402.20] toally disconnected saying
[2399.32 - 2404.12] that maybe he's in coma he's in samadi
[2402.20 - 2405.84] he's not in coma he's not it's a
[2404.12 - 2408.12] different level and then there's an
[2405.84 - 2409.40] instent in sh sa Baba's life many people
[2408.12 - 2411.48] don't know this that you know he was
[2409.40 - 2413.60] going to trans consciously he told one
[2411.48 - 2417.12] of his devotees that I'll be out for 7
[2413.60 - 2418.96] days out as in body yeah okay so
[2417.12 - 2421.36] there'll be no activity but I'll come
[2418.96 - 2423.64] back after 7 days so imagine now there
[2421.36 - 2425.48] is no activity s sa has gone into
[2423.64 - 2426.76] different trans into different world can
[2425.48 - 2429.04] you believe after 2 days all the
[2426.76 - 2430.96] devotees said he's dead okay let's burn
[2429.04 - 2432.96] him he said no my Guru has told me he'll
[2430.96 - 2435.52] come back he'll be surprised he came
[2432.96 - 2438.08] back after 7 days now Ram Krishna Pam so
[2435.52 - 2439.84] I had this particular I would say catch
[2438.08 - 2441.32] if I'm going to trans I will have one
[2439.84 - 2444.24] thought that will bring me back and he
[2441.32 - 2445.56] said okay I want a gab Jam so the way he
[2444.24 - 2447.96] used to come out the trans is very
[2445.56 - 2450.80] surprising just shout gulab jabun gulab
[2447.96 - 2453.24] jab gulab ja this great Master is stuck
[2450.80 - 2455.40] to gulab J it's not stuck because you
[2453.24 - 2458.20] don't have a thought like for example
[2455.40 - 2461.08] you know I say this the dad
[2458.20 - 2461.08] to make boys
[2461.60 - 2465.80] responsible it may look like a joke but
[2463.80 - 2467.68] what happens is that if somebody is
[2465.80 - 2469.16] irresponsible but through marriage he
[2467.68 - 2472.08] becomes responsible he has to come back
[2469.16 - 2474.76] every day home right pH where are
[2472.08 - 2476.32] you so the idea is that this particular
[2474.76 - 2477.12] point that when you go into that stage
[2476.32 - 2478.64] of
[2477.12 - 2480.20] thoughtlessness sometimes you have to
[2478.64 - 2481.92] come back with a thought the thought
[2480.20 - 2483.92] could be gab jamun or could be anything
[2481.92 - 2485.76] else as a nutritionist I wouldn't
[2483.92 - 2487.88] prescribe a gulab jamun maybe when I'm
[2485.76 - 2490.72] working with a modern day Guru I would
[2487.88 - 2493.52] think more like amla with dipped in
[2490.72 - 2496.32] Honey dates OD dates you know that would
[2493.52 - 2498.56] be good but in your experience Dr pilai
[2496.32 - 2501.44] in this meditative world of ancient
[2498.56 - 2503.44] sages gurus and all has there been any
[2501.44 - 2505.72] protocol written when it comes to
[2503.44 - 2507.76] nutrition uh to attain a meditative
[2505.72 - 2509.60] state in the ancient text have you come
[2507.76 - 2511.32] across anything so I have seen some
[2509.60 - 2513.92] references I mean not a student of
[2511.32 - 2515.80] nutrition like you so there are many
[2513.92 - 2518.88] references in two three books that I can
[2515.80 - 2523.00] tell you one is p yoga Sutra it talks
[2518.88 - 2525.36] about ahar V and V ahar V how do you
[2523.00 - 2526.92] think because thoughts are also food for
[2525.36 - 2529.00] the mind a good quality of thought can
[2526.92 - 2531.08] give you energy like a good food can
[2529.00 - 2533.32] nutrition can give energy for the body a
[2531.08 - 2535.60] negative thought can drain you energy
[2533.32 - 2537.68] imagine getting up with a nightmare
[2535.60 - 2539.48] you're already drained out true so this
[2537.68 - 2540.76] is the first book the second book is
[2539.48 - 2543.80] charaka
[2540.76 - 2545.88] Sam and shush samita these are aura
[2543.80 - 2547.80] books and of course ARA shastra also
[2545.88 - 2550.92] mentions about food for not only human
[2547.80 - 2553.20] beings but also for Animals plants also
[2550.92 - 2556.56] so there was an ancient wisdom about how
[2553.20 - 2558.84] to feed the Mind feed the soul feed the
[2556.56 - 2560.84] body feed the ecosystem can I give an
[2558.84 - 2563.16] example you'll be surprised that how
[2560.84 - 2566.48] food and the mind works have you ever
[2563.16 - 2569.88] heard about elephants being given meat
[2566.48 - 2572.32] no alcohol No No in fact subscribed by
[2569.88 - 2575.08] chak not for ordinary elephants
[2572.32 - 2577.56] elephants are herbus correct they don't
[2575.08 - 2580.36] eat meat but you'll be surprised was
[2577.56 - 2582.76] training war elephants and in war if you
[2580.36 - 2586.56] see every particular Army has got a war
[2582.76 - 2588.84] cry it is to energize you oh you know uh
[2586.56 - 2590.80] what war cries we have different
[2588.84 - 2593.36] countries different regiments have this
[2590.80 - 2595.72] war cries harar mahad and all those
[2593.36 - 2598.64] things you'll be surprised that's only
[2595.72 - 2601.60] at the verbal level drums and all the
[2598.64 - 2603.12] mind gets active now think about it that
[2601.60 - 2605.32] these elephants who are supposed to be
[2603.12 - 2607.80] going on attacking the enemy they were
[2605.32 - 2609.80] given alcohol alcohol not today's terms
[2607.80 - 2611.76] but certain herbs and all now what is to
[2609.80 - 2613.84] happen is that when you consume that
[2611.76 - 2615.44] your body suddenly becomes active your
[2613.84 - 2617.92] mind becomes active and that has to be
[2615.44 - 2619.76] directed so think about it that pregnant
[2617.92 - 2621.44] elephants are given different diet and
[2619.76 - 2623.52] war elephants different diets and they
[2621.44 - 2625.32] even today if you look at I work with
[2623.52 - 2627.72] the police department there are certain
[2625.32 - 2630.12] police academies where still they have
[2627.72 - 2632.08] horses yes correct and you'll be
[2630.12 - 2633.96] surprised they measuring how much
[2632.08 - 2635.52] quantity of food they had which quality
[2633.96 - 2637.80] the dogs that are there on the payroll
[2635.52 - 2639.44] of the government are actually being
[2637.80 - 2641.32] mapped with the nutrition value that
[2639.44 - 2643.40] they give so why only limited to human
[2641.32 - 2646.32] beings a nutritionist works with the
[2643.40 - 2649.04] whole society and all living beings so
[2646.32 - 2651.24] we should eat more out of Science and
[2649.04 - 2652.84] that's where we need to also connect so
[2651.24 - 2655.12] connect with your breath connect with
[2652.84 - 2656.64] your thought connect with your nutrition
[2655.12 - 2659.12] and connect with yourself connect with
[2656.64 - 2663.00] yourself people nowadays Focus mainly on
[2659.12 - 2665.40] an external Dimension fashionability how
[2663.00 - 2667.96] I'm looking flashy in society which bag
[2665.40 - 2669.92] am I carrying what car am I turning up
[2667.96 - 2672.76] in and all of this stuff
[2669.92 - 2675.92] fashion what would be the magic Mantra
[2672.76 - 2678.40] to be both happy inside and successful
[2675.92 - 2680.04] outside I love fashion so let me tell
[2678.40 - 2681.88] you what your one Indulgence that you
[2680.04 - 2684.40] can share with our followers Watchers
[2681.88 - 2686.64] you love Watchers I love watches okay
[2684.40 - 2688.96] but you know for me Watchers is not just
[2686.64 - 2692.12] about the the kind of a design part of
[2688.96 - 2694.68] it it's also a sense because I love
[2692.12 - 2696.44] Watchers it's a sense like you know a
[2694.68 - 2698.24] color that suits you may not suit me
[2696.44 - 2700.24] certain people watches because of the
[2698.24 - 2702.20] technicalities some people like Swiss
[2700.24 - 2704.24] watches not because it's costly the
[2702.20 - 2706.08] mechanism the mechanism part of it so
[2704.24 - 2707.80] for me that's one love you know some
[2706.08 - 2709.72] people love cars some people like
[2707.80 - 2711.64] clothing I do understand little bit of
[2709.72 - 2714.00] design also because Chaka spoke about
[2711.64 - 2716.44] designs but for me watches is one thing
[2714.00 - 2718.32] now coming back to the point of fashion
[2716.44 - 2720.72] you know it's very important that good
[2718.32 - 2723.12] product should be packaged well good
[2720.72 - 2724.68] product should be packaged well what's
[2723.12 - 2727.20] this got to do with my internal so if
[2724.68 - 2729.04] I'm a good human being okay internal I
[2727.20 - 2730.48] should be a man of character but that
[2729.04 - 2732.32] doesn't mean I have to be you know in
[2730.48 - 2734.64] rubbish all the time so why can't be
[2732.32 - 2736.12] good inside and fashionable outside but
[2734.64 - 2738.16] lot of people do the other way around
[2736.12 - 2740.24] they show fashion outside but the
[2738.16 - 2742.28] character is very loose you can attract
[2740.24 - 2744.56] people because of the external success
[2742.28 - 2746.80] for a limited period of time so we have
[2744.56 - 2749.28] to have a mix of spirituality and
[2746.80 - 2750.96] material success if the youngsters today
[2749.28 - 2753.28] had to reflect this because they
[2750.96 - 2756.36] constantly bombarded by marketing you
[2753.28 - 2758.32] know you need to wear this brand or you
[2756.36 - 2760.20] need to do do this or whatever it is and
[2758.32 - 2763.08] there are so many youngsters today that
[2760.20 - 2766.08] are impressionable one or two tips for
[2763.08 - 2767.84] these youngsters when they are 18 1920
[2766.08 - 2769.20] they're not listening to Mommy Daddy
[2767.84 - 2770.96] they're listening to the world they're
[2769.20 - 2773.04] listening to podcast they're listening
[2770.96 - 2776.12] to other people out there what would the
[2773.04 - 2778.52] guru of meditation of Mind of thought
[2776.12 - 2781.56] talk to them and say beta these are
[2778.52 - 2783.20] three things I want you to do so three
[2781.56 - 2785.76] things I want to do is number one read
[2783.20 - 2787.48] the right books read the right books
[2785.76 - 2789.92] okay it's very important the reason is
[2787.48 - 2792.32] that because 18 19 20 is a very
[2789.92 - 2794.40] vulnerable age your future depends on
[2792.32 - 2796.00] the decisions that you take at this age
[2794.40 - 2798.24] your future is completely different
[2796.00 - 2800.12] because now you have to live your life
[2798.24 - 2802.16] in a very different way so the books
[2800.12 - 2804.72] that you read be choosy I'm not telling
[2802.16 - 2806.84] you don't read you know glamorous books
[2804.72 - 2808.16] or romantic books it's a part of life
[2806.84 - 2809.44] but you know at that particular point of
[2808.16 - 2811.60] time you to be sure about your
[2809.44 - 2813.20] financials your career your
[2811.60 - 2815.40] relationships so there a lot of good
[2813.20 - 2817.56] books there and what you said Ryan sir
[2815.40 - 2819.88] is also important that we read read
[2817.56 - 2821.76] scientifically analyzed books for me
[2819.88 - 2823.64] books is not just about storytelling
[2821.76 - 2825.24] imagine today the highest category of
[2823.64 - 2826.80] Book Sales in India is actually
[2825.24 - 2828.68] non-fiction book somebody who's a
[2826.80 - 2830.72] scientist somebody who's done work in
[2828.68 - 2833.04] that field who's got the experience so
[2830.72 - 2835.56] first thing is read books second you
[2833.04 - 2838.04] know please you know balance between
[2835.56 - 2840.00] work and life because please understand
[2838.04 - 2841.68] you'll have to work and don't get burnt
[2840.00 - 2844.28] out fortunately we are a generation
[2841.68 - 2846.56] where we don't have problems much of Roy
[2844.28 - 2848.60] K but we have to be careful which kind
[2846.56 - 2849.72] of a you wear which kind of a Roy you
[2848.60 - 2852.24] eat or don't
[2849.72 - 2853.72] eat good one and if you have a small
[2852.24 - 2856.12] house it can still be aesthetically
[2853.72 - 2858.20] beautiful true people say if you can't
[2856.12 - 2860.80] build a small house beautifully you'll
[2858.20 - 2863.00] never keep a big house beautiful that's
[2860.80 - 2864.88] so wise that's so wise so it's very
[2863.00 - 2866.72] important that you have this particular
[2864.88 - 2868.96] you know sense of beauty also in your
[2866.72 - 2870.60] life so work life balance work life
[2868.96 - 2873.00] balance and the third important thing
[2870.60 - 2874.88] please spend time with yourself lot of
[2873.00 - 2878.04] youngsters are in that whole mood of you
[2874.88 - 2880.32] to go for a party time me time I me
[2878.04 - 2883.36] myself so would you tell a youngster
[2880.32 - 2886.56] today the me time is devoid of TV devoid
[2883.36 - 2888.76] of mobile phone which can distract and
[2886.56 - 2891.08] div of friends also you may be hang on
[2888.76 - 2893.68] hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on
[2891.08 - 2896.52] one second this is important I you're
[2893.68 - 2898.92] telling in 18 19 20 year watch your
[2896.52 - 2901.48] friends don't have friends or be divid
[2898.92 - 2903.68] of friends please expand this thought so
[2901.48 - 2905.76] we unravel it for the youngsters out
[2903.68 - 2907.44] there please understand life is never a
[2905.76 - 2909.36] lonely Journey you have to have friends
[2907.44 - 2912.40] with you and friends for life in fact in
[2909.36 - 2914.52] our country in our culture we say your
[2912.40 - 2916.40] best friend is your spouse but remember
[2914.52 - 2918.72] one thing you need to understand that
[2916.40 - 2920.56] friend is also an individual okay you
[2918.72 - 2922.68] know I'll tell you this whole problem is
[2920.56 - 2925.00] about privacy you may have a best friend
[2922.68 - 2927.52] but he or she also requires his or her
[2925.00 - 2929.36] time don't you require your time because
[2927.52 - 2931.08] friends coming too close also is a
[2929.36 - 2934.36] problem see I'll tell you there's a
[2931.08 - 2935.92] concept called sayami twins H they
[2934.36 - 2938.40] together but they can't be separated
[2935.92 - 2939.96] it's a problem so what is important that
[2938.40 - 2942.00] in your age you should have the right
[2939.96 - 2943.72] friends choose your friends carefully
[2942.00 - 2945.88] you can be friendly to everyone but your
[2943.72 - 2947.80] have core friends a five six of them are
[2945.88 - 2949.20] very important support them they should
[2947.80 - 2950.64] support you but remember one thing there
[2949.20 - 2952.52] are times when you should sit alone
[2950.64 - 2954.48] without a friend also because at the end
[2952.52 - 2957.28] of it you're an individual and you
[2954.48 - 2958.60] should maintain the individuality when I
[2957.28 - 2960.80] say individuality I'm not talking about
[2958.60 - 2963.52] ego so for example you know it's very
[2960.80 - 2966.20] important that we spend time in solitude
[2963.52 - 2969.04] don't be alone but enjoy your Solitude
[2966.20 - 2971.24] also otherwise it can lead to loneliness
[2969.04 - 2973.60] being alone can be very very lonely and
[2971.24 - 2975.68] loneliness is a psychological problem
[2973.60 - 2977.52] many developed countries today having
[2975.68 - 2980.12] loneliness as a psychological problem
[2977.52 - 2982.48] mental health at the same time you know
[2980.12 - 2984.52] in the name of loneliness we forget that
[2982.48 - 2986.52] we should enjoy being alone also so if
[2984.52 - 2988.68] you can take I'm not taking you know 24
[2986.52 - 2991.56] hours you to be you know shut up in a
[2988.68 - 2993.76] room but can you sit down 10 minutes all
[2991.56 - 2995.84] alone without your mobile without your
[2993.76 - 2998.24] gadgets without a friends also can you
[2995.84 - 3000.04] just go for a walk alone and of course
[2998.24 - 3003.64] after 10 minutes take your friend
[3000.04 - 3005.96] along wise words of wisdom Dr P
[3003.64 - 3008.68] absolutely wise I wish I met you when I
[3005.96 - 3010.40] was 18 years of age now I'm getting very
[3008.68 - 3012.96] very enamored because you explained to
[3010.40 - 3015.84] me about how he wrote how to make King
[3012.96 - 3018.52] makers I want to become king of my life
[3015.84 - 3020.96] my followers and our fans and everybody
[3018.52 - 3023.20] everybody wants to bring be the king or
[3020.96 - 3025.64] the queen of their life what he wrote
[3023.20 - 3027.32] was in the happiness of the people is
[3025.64 - 3029.76] the happiness of the king it's a very
[3027.32 - 3033.48] important thought of the chanakya now
[3029.76 - 3036.08] why does everybody need to think like a
[3033.48 - 3039.96] king or think like a leader because
[3036.08 - 3039.96] there is no what do you say
[3041.28 - 3047.00] reward what is your words of wisdom for
[3044.72 - 3049.32] people to transcend to the next level
[3047.00 - 3050.92] maybe in this lifetime or the next time
[3049.32 - 3052.36] what is it and why is it important to
[3050.92 - 3056.00] think like a leader let me tell you a
[3052.36 - 3058.52] story so there was a spiritual Guru and
[3056.00 - 3060.56] everybody you know is to go for his
[3058.52 - 3062.80] blessings and advice and there's a very
[3060.56 - 3064.44] popular scene that whoever goes to him
[3062.80 - 3067.16] for taking his guidance mentoring
[3064.44 - 3069.00] blessings will become a leader and then
[3067.16 - 3071.20] there a intelligent boy intelligent
[3069.00 - 3073.48] means asking questions that doesn't
[3071.20 - 3074.68] guarantee intelligence H just because
[3073.48 - 3077.24] your questioning doesn't make you
[3074.68 - 3079.36] intelligent but okay we should answer
[3077.24 - 3081.36] questions so this intelligent boy ask
[3079.36 - 3083.44] everybody goes to meet that Guru so
[3081.36 - 3085.32] maybe let's say 10 people go how can 10
[3083.44 - 3087.20] of them be leaders CU in a group only
[3085.32 - 3088.92] one can be a leader like if there is a
[3087.20 - 3090.52] game of cricket let's say there's a team
[3088.92 - 3092.32] of cricket only one person give me
[3090.52 - 3094.00] Captain how can everybody be a leader
[3092.32 - 3096.24] you know what the person said you are
[3094.00 - 3098.60] right that everybody cannot be a leader
[3096.24 - 3100.88] of the same team but everybody can be
[3098.60 - 3102.68] leader of different teams for example
[3100.88 - 3104.56] one person can be a sports leader one
[3102.68 - 3106.12] person can be a political leader one
[3104.56 - 3108.04] person can be a leader in the field of
[3106.12 - 3109.92] science person like you is a leader in
[3108.04 - 3112.12] the field of nutrition I am a leader in
[3109.92 - 3114.28] my space so why it is important to think
[3112.12 - 3116.36] like a leader because you strive for
[3114.28 - 3117.84] excellence a leader is not a position in
[3116.36 - 3119.68] fact a great leader is the one who
[3117.84 - 3121.44] creates more leaders lot of people in
[3119.68 - 3123.32] leadership position don't like to give
[3121.44 - 3125.32] up the position and that's where the
[3123.32 - 3126.64] downfall starts so leadership is a way
[3125.32 - 3128.88] of thinking and let me tell you
[3126.64 - 3132.28] leadership is also a spiritual quality
[3128.88 - 3132.28] as you quoted the Sans
[3133.20 - 3137.88] sura a leader is not about I me myself
[3136.08 - 3139.52] that's ego and that's where downfall
[3137.88 - 3141.36] starts a leader is the one who wants to
[3139.52 - 3143.00] make his people happy so you decide your
[3141.36 - 3144.92] field of leadership like you have chosen
[3143.00 - 3147.04] nutrition I have chosen Chaka maybe
[3144.92 - 3148.88] somebody else has chose writing or maybe
[3147.04 - 3151.08] you know discovering something business
[3148.88 - 3153.76] leader but there you don't think like
[3151.08 - 3156.84] you know the more you give the more you
[3153.76 - 3159.28] are a leader I'm going off my research
[3156.84 - 3161.60] you have a very thought provocating
[3159.28 - 3165.44] information to me leader should not have
[3161.60 - 3167.36] ego right ego thought how does it come
[3165.44 - 3169.36] does it come from the womb does it come
[3167.36 - 3172.24] from a parental upbringing does it come
[3169.36 - 3174.88] in college years does it come in life is
[3172.24 - 3176.24] the social media influencing our ego
[3174.88 - 3177.84] because I'm trying to ask you this
[3176.24 - 3180.32] question question that I think a lot of
[3177.84 - 3183.48] people who I have met who do meditation
[3180.32 - 3186.28] the ego is very humble so can you kind
[3183.48 - 3187.84] of light my lamp on this that I
[3186.28 - 3189.80] constantly you know when I'm leading my
[3187.84 - 3192.24] teams as a nutritionist I have to keep
[3189.80 - 3195.16] reminding myself be humble but the ego
[3192.24 - 3197.32] comes in very fast so I'm getting a free
[3195.16 - 3200.04] lesson here today free consultation with
[3197.32 - 3202.20] Dr P I just realized that so what's your
[3200.04 - 3204.44] advice to me so let me start with the
[3202.20 - 3206.84] first question where does the ego gets
[3204.44 - 3208.52] created remember the child if you see
[3206.84 - 3211.48] the little children especially the one
[3208.52 - 3213.72] who are below 5 years you'll find that
[3211.48 - 3215.16] they less of ego they're very innocent
[3213.72 - 3217.44] they can mix up with anybody and
[3215.16 - 3220.08] everybody they don't understand concepts
[3217.44 - 3222.28] of religion Community nationality gender
[3220.08 - 3226.16] also for that matter you know where ego
[3222.28 - 3227.64] starts you'll be surprised the mirror
[3226.16 - 3229.68] you know the child when is born doesn't
[3227.64 - 3231.64] even know what is a mirror and then we
[3229.68 - 3234.16] train them you're a boy you're a girl
[3231.64 - 3235.28] you to wear pink you to wear blue and
[3234.16 - 3237.48] then one day you show your mirror and
[3235.28 - 3239.32] the child starts wondering a this makes
[3237.48 - 3241.64] me different so there is something
[3239.32 - 3244.20] called body Consciousness I'm different
[3241.64 - 3245.68] from you you're different from me and
[3244.20 - 3247.84] then you want to develop this
[3245.68 - 3249.44] individuality the body and when you grow
[3247.84 - 3251.44] you want to build up your muscles you to
[3249.44 - 3253.60] build up your style fashion and you
[3251.44 - 3255.36] start being different please understand
[3253.60 - 3256.80] that's only the physical ego that you're
[3255.36 - 3258.36] different from them but what happens we
[3256.80 - 3260.92] start categorizing them in different
[3258.36 - 3263.08] formats for example I'm the boss you are
[3260.92 - 3264.72] the junior I have more salaries you
[3263.08 - 3266.96] don't have you'll be surprised if you
[3264.72 - 3269.44] have the spiritual blent of mind you can
[3266.96 - 3272.08] work with everybody without and with
[3269.44 - 3274.00] hierarchy also for example let's say you
[3272.08 - 3276.40] know Ryan s you give me example that
[3274.00 - 3278.56] when you started like anyone of us a
[3276.40 - 3280.48] small office you'll be surprised that
[3278.56 - 3282.56] I'm sure during those days you wouldn't
[3280.48 - 3284.12] mind you know brooming your office also
[3282.56 - 3286.56] no I was chapari and I was vice
[3284.12 - 3288.40] president so all put together so P2P
[3286.56 - 3290.84] Pune to president P to president I like
[3288.40 - 3292.64] that P2P now think about it today you
[3290.84 - 3294.20] got 80 plus people and tomorrow you
[3292.64 - 3295.80] hundreds of them one day if the office
[3294.20 - 3297.32] is not clean you don't mind cleaning up
[3295.80 - 3299.00] because you don't have that you know
[3297.32 - 3300.52] that I'm the boss of course I'm the boss
[3299.00 - 3302.44] I may have somebody to clean the office
[3300.52 - 3304.76] but I don't have
[3302.44 - 3306.40] that now what is the lesson for
[3304.76 - 3309.12] leadership how do you keep your ego
[3306.40 - 3312.00] under control from time to time do the
[3309.12 - 3315.04] last man's job that's not your job from
[3312.00 - 3317.36] time to time do the last man's job but
[3315.04 - 3319.08] that's not your job as a leader yeah
[3317.36 - 3320.92] your job is to it's kind of saying keep
[3319.08 - 3323.84] yourself grounded grounded from time to
[3320.92 - 3325.36] time and then take off don't come down
[3323.84 - 3327.96] so down that you forget that you're
[3325.36 - 3329.36] supposed to take everybody up so it's
[3327.96 - 3331.56] very important to be aware that
[3329.36 - 3333.48] everybody has got a role to play and as
[3331.56 - 3335.28] a leader you have to use your power also
[3333.48 - 3337.92] please understand leadership is not just
[3335.28 - 3340.00] being humble a lot of people act humble
[3337.92 - 3341.60] but are not humble humility is a strange
[3340.00 - 3344.12] thing the day you think you have it you
[3341.60 - 3346.88] lost it it's very very interesting and I
[3344.12 - 3349.00] think when you talk about ego and coming
[3346.88 - 3350.80] down to that one day of doing the the
[3349.00 - 3353.48] first job or the last job in the
[3350.80 - 3355.52] organization I think what is sounding
[3353.48 - 3357.28] Out in my head is parents cuz I'm a
[3355.52 - 3359.48] father you're a father and we are at
[3357.28 - 3362.52] that age where if I go somewhere people
[3359.48 - 3365.20] say uncle to me right so I'm like going
[3362.52 - 3367.40] into that role which is how do I lead
[3365.20 - 3369.00] like a wise parent or if I have my
[3367.40 - 3372.28] family how do I behave like a wise
[3369.00 - 3374.56] parent so in the sutras OR in chanakya's
[3372.28 - 3376.60] Formula was there anything about
[3374.56 - 3380.16] parenting and what are the significance
[3376.60 - 3383.92] of any sutras regarding parenting so let
[3380.16 - 3386.36] me especially for Indian parents okay
[3383.92 - 3388.56] parenting is a role that ends
[3386.36 - 3391.36] unfortunately that becomes an identity
[3388.56 - 3394.28] for life I'm sorry parenting is a role
[3391.36 - 3396.72] that ends but unfortunately for Indian
[3394.28 - 3399.00] parents it becomes an identity forever
[3396.72 - 3401.24] let's say tomorrow your child is 60 you
[3399.00 - 3402.44] still be a parent no but I get where
[3401.24 - 3405.56] you're going
[3402.44 - 3407.84] because yeah it is true so you're saying
[3405.56 - 3410.84] this is especially for Indian parents
[3407.84 - 3412.68] and why is that that's where chak advice
[3410.84 - 3414.80] comes in because we too attached to our
[3412.68 - 3416.68] children please understand family is
[3414.80 - 3419.52] important but the roles in a family
[3416.68 - 3421.16] changes roles in a family changes with
[3419.52 - 3423.12] the evolvement of time is that what
[3421.16 - 3424.64] you're saying abely absolutely like for
[3423.12 - 3426.84] example when you don't have children
[3424.64 - 3428.12] you're still part of your family yes
[3426.84 - 3429.68] when you go to your spouse you're still
[3428.12 - 3431.20] part of your family yes when you become
[3429.68 - 3433.32] parent you're still part of your family
[3431.20 - 3435.60] yes but you know when I'm a parent I
[3433.32 - 3437.08] remain a parent forever interesting
[3435.60 - 3439.28] that's why I tell people know your body
[3437.08 - 3440.76] is the most expensive real estate you
[3439.28 - 3442.48] can change everything on the planet but
[3440.76 - 3445.28] you can't change your parents you're
[3442.48 - 3448.12] stuck with them for life so chanaka is
[3445.28 - 3450.24] advising to decouple so here is the
[3448.12 - 3452.68] Sutra that comes in and very interesting
[3450.24 - 3454.80] on parenting till 5 Years love your
[3452.68 - 3457.20] child for the next 10 years discipline
[3454.80 - 3460.36] him or her and after that consider the
[3457.20 - 3462.48] child your friend wise words so first 5
[3460.36 - 3464.28] Years love your child unconditionally
[3462.48 - 3466.84] even if they break your latest mobile
[3464.28 - 3468.64] you can't do anything you're innocent
[3466.84 - 3470.96] they're not doing it consciously but
[3468.64 - 3472.72] next 10 years their minds are thinking
[3470.96 - 3474.40] their intellect is developing so you
[3472.72 - 3476.84] have to be logical with them so
[3474.40 - 3478.20] basically the age of about 6 to 20 is
[3476.84 - 3480.20] when we're disciplining them so we have
[3478.20 - 3482.24] to learn to say no to our children not
[3480.20 - 3483.84] necessarily no I would say logically
[3482.24 - 3485.72] telling them what is right and wrong see
[3483.84 - 3487.96] no is not the only way of disciplining
[3485.72 - 3490.68] correct logically telling them what is
[3487.96 - 3493.12] right and wrong it is called via Bui so
[3490.68 - 3495.08] I I I'm I mean this is very very in the
[3493.12 - 3496.68] high plane of intellectual and I'm
[3495.08 - 3500.16] scratching my brain here I'm coming down
[3496.68 - 3502.48] to my basic Prime Primal uh nutrition
[3500.16 - 3505.48] brain which is Papa I want a mobile
[3502.48 - 3506.92] phone of course I'm 11 years of age now
[3505.48 - 3508.92] as a parent
[3506.92 - 3510.64] my thought process is do I give him a
[3508.92 - 3513.28] mobile phone do I not give him a mobile
[3510.64 - 3514.80] phone so what would chakya say so I tell
[3513.28 - 3517.16] you that's a mistake can you avoid
[3514.80 - 3519.44] giving a phone can I avoid giving a
[3517.16 - 3521.76] phone you may not give your phone you
[3519.44 - 3524.16] may not own a phone yeah he has given
[3521.76 - 3526.28] you the first right of denial that's all
[3524.16 - 3527.72] he will anyway earn it so the thought
[3526.28 - 3529.36] itself that if my child is asking a
[3527.72 - 3531.28] phone your answer would be yes or no who
[3529.36 - 3532.52] told the answer has to be only two boxes
[3531.28 - 3536.20] I'll tell you how I deal with such a
[3532.52 - 3538.76] situation I know my child is still 11
[3536.20 - 3541.96] son has asked for a phone already
[3538.76 - 3544.92] already okay my daughter Al they come
[3541.96 - 3547.80] together so there is a CH com combin
[3544.92 - 3549.92] power I have a combin power my wife also
[3547.80 - 3551.72] ask your mother you know please
[3549.92 - 3554.36] understand you have to respect that they
[3551.72 - 3556.16] born a generation of gadgets they're
[3554.36 - 3558.60] smarter generation absolutely and
[3556.16 - 3560.24] they're more informed than us yes what I
[3558.60 - 3561.60] say that of course you'll have a mobile
[3560.24 - 3564.84] but please tell me the reason why you
[3561.60 - 3567.76] want it ah wise words from an ancient
[3564.84 - 3570.20] Sage I'm going to use this can I borrow
[3567.76 - 3571.96] this for my son please tell me why you
[3570.20 - 3574.52] require and then you'll be surprised you
[3571.96 - 3576.44] can guide him before giving the phone H
[3574.52 - 3578.16] so for example he wants you you know
[3576.44 - 3580.32] because children make you different
[3578.16 - 3581.96] answers I tell you a small story and
[3580.32 - 3584.04] then you'll understand how important a
[3581.96 - 3585.40] phone is for a child so there was this
[3584.04 - 3588.64] particular friend of mine his daughter
[3585.40 - 3588.64] was in 10th standard board
[3590.32 - 3596.36] exam okay so exams are and the M was
[3593.76 - 3599.24] taken away she had a mobile it was taken
[3596.36 - 3601.32] away 2:00 the 2:00 in the night this
[3599.24 - 3604.80] person wakes up and he finds in his
[3601.32 - 3607.96] daughter's room there is some light so
[3604.80 - 3612.40] father he goes inside and he sees the
[3607.96 - 3616.24] girl on a mobile so angry so upset he
[3612.40 - 3616.24] just takes the mobile breaks
[3617.60 - 3623.72] it and then wife comes out and you
[3621.60 - 3625.12] continue studying let's go and sleep
[3623.72 - 3627.80] next day when he's cool down a little
[3625.12 - 3629.28] bit the wife you know what please go and
[3627.80 - 3631.44] talk to your daughter never do that to
[3629.28 - 3633.00] your daughter well then know she was not
[3631.44 - 3634.76] studying she was using the mobile and
[3633.00 - 3637.04] all we had given a strict rule not to
[3634.76 - 3638.68] use the mobile during exam time she went
[3637.04 - 3640.44] and she was crying the papa you know
[3638.68 - 3643.96] what I was doing on the mobile I was
[3640.44 - 3646.48] checking out for a marksheets sorry exam
[3643.96 - 3649.08] Hall ticket because everything is
[3646.48 - 3650.84] digital today so my friends got it till
[3649.08 - 3653.28] the last moment yesterday night I did
[3650.84 - 3654.84] not get it I was downloading it and you
[3653.28 - 3657.00] just break it away now how do I go for
[3654.84 - 3658.96] my exam to use your Mobile know the idea
[3657.00 - 3660.36] is that people will use mobile but the
[3658.96 - 3662.24] thing is that you have to be conscious
[3660.36 - 3664.16] what they're using for so if it's going
[3662.24 - 3666.64] to be a social media addiction why do
[3664.16 - 3668.12] you need the phone yeah tell me why you
[3666.64 - 3669.84] need the phone and then you can
[3668.12 - 3671.52] discipline like I say you take my mobile
[3669.84 - 3673.76] take your mobile but use it for only one
[3671.52 - 3677.04] hour or half an hour what do you decide
[3673.76 - 3679.68] wise words of parenting so staying with
[3677.04 - 3681.68] chanaka and chanaka is going to become
[3679.68 - 3684.00] like if I went back in a time capsule
[3681.68 - 3686.36] I'll be like I would like to do
[3684.00 - 3687.92] chanakya's diet plan that that would be
[3686.36 - 3689.96] my thought process cuz I'm falling in
[3687.92 - 3693.08] love with this process let's have a
[3689.96 - 3695.16] small discussion on this chanakya nitis
[3693.08 - 3698.04] enlighten me about it on how the
[3695.16 - 3701.08] chanakya nitis can improve our lifestyle
[3698.04 - 3703.60] so chanakya's nitis Niti the word means
[3701.08 - 3705.56] policies stategies plan it all comes
[3703.60 - 3708.20] from an intellect way of intelligent way
[3705.56 - 3711.56] of living a life so as we said the
[3708.20 - 3714.04] different stages of life for example if
[3711.56 - 3717.24] you are below 20 your primary
[3714.04 - 3720.00] responsibility is to be a student
[3717.24 - 3722.40] after 20s to let's say 50s it's to bring
[3720.00 - 3724.40] up a family after 50 you have to give
[3722.40 - 3726.08] back to the society because your basic
[3724.40 - 3728.64] financial needs are taken care your
[3726.08 - 3730.72] children are settled and after 75 you're
[3728.64 - 3733.04] supposed to be 100% focused on
[3730.72 - 3735.12] spirituality and he gives advis us at
[3733.04 - 3737.60] every stage how to be a good student how
[3735.12 - 3739.24] to be a good husband or parent as we saw
[3737.60 - 3741.44] or a good mother how do you bring up
[3739.24 - 3743.24] your children how to actually give back
[3741.44 - 3744.60] to society and finally how to give up
[3743.24 - 3746.44] the world also when I say give up the
[3744.60 - 3749.00] world is not death of the body but you
[3746.44 - 3750.80] know lot of people with high egos cannot
[3749.00 - 3752.56] give up their positions that's why
[3750.80 - 3755.04] there's a concept called SAS you have to
[3752.56 - 3756.84] live the body so chakia strategies and
[3755.04 - 3759.48] needes are applicable for every
[3756.84 - 3761.68] generation at every point of time so let
[3759.48 - 3764.32] me give you two examples for our
[3761.68 - 3766.32] discussion if you're a student your
[3764.32 - 3768.68] primary responsibility is studies but it
[3766.32 - 3770.92] is not studies like today it is becoming
[3768.68 - 3774.20] more memory today education system has
[3770.92 - 3775.84] become an examination system so a good
[3774.20 - 3777.96] student has a quality of learning from
[3775.84 - 3780.12] from anybody and everybody not just the
[3777.96 - 3782.28] teachers so if you're watching a podcast
[3780.12 - 3784.40] and learning great but can you apply
[3782.28 - 3786.88] that in your life so Chaka prepar
[3784.40 - 3788.44] students to learn from every teacher
[3786.88 - 3790.72] unfortunately today's generation they
[3788.44 - 3793.20] were rating a
[3790.72 - 3795.52] teacher imagine if chanaka was around
[3793.20 - 3798.56] right now it's okay his Google reviews
[3795.52 - 3800.68] would have been split I still remember
[3798.56 - 3802.76] one small child had come to a parent and
[3800.68 - 3804.92] say this teacher is not bad sorry this
[3802.76 - 3806.76] teacher is not good he or she is bad and
[3804.92 - 3810.52] the father a very wise father as you
[3806.76 - 3813.64] know are you comparing two teachers ah
[3810.52 - 3815.24] compared to what exactly so maybe that
[3813.64 - 3817.32] particular teacher doesn't have great
[3815.24 - 3819.00] communication skills that's why he
[3817.32 - 3820.88] cannot hold your attention but that
[3819.00 - 3822.52] attention can be held through a video on
[3820.88 - 3824.24] the screen that doesn't make a great
[3822.52 - 3826.44] teacher a teacher is a person who has
[3824.24 - 3829.08] got wisdom of that subject so never
[3826.44 - 3830.76] compare because some person uses a
[3829.08 - 3832.56] different methodology of teaching so how
[3830.76 - 3834.24] to be a good student now coming back
[3832.56 - 3836.16] what is the responsibility of a father
[3834.24 - 3837.96] there's a chak for that also so the
[3836.16 - 3840.00] responsib of Father are three point
[3837.96 - 3841.80] number one to earn for the family let me
[3840.00 - 3843.56] look like you know today we have wives
[3841.80 - 3847.00] also earning let me tell you very
[3843.56 - 3851.68] frankly let the wife own that's her
[3847.00 - 3851.68] money but if she doesn't ear it's your
[3861.52 - 3866.04] responsibility because all since I
[3863.76 - 3869.52] married my wife 15 years ago she's to
[3866.04 - 3873.92] always say my money is my money and your
[3869.52 - 3873.92] money is my money I thought origal
[3877.32 - 3882.04] dialog so that's why you'll be surprised
[3879.96 - 3884.92] that the role of a parent is number one
[3882.04 - 3887.76] to earn money and please understand
[3884.92 - 3889.08] wealth is not neglected in our society
[3887.76 - 3891.52] we are the only country in the world
[3889.08 - 3893.60] which is spiritualized wealth Lakshmi
[3891.52 - 3895.72] lakmi is also shaki if you don't have
[3893.60 - 3897.28] money what kind of a life you'll have
[3895.72 - 3899.48] I'm not trying to tell you that be you
[3897.28 - 3901.92] know overboard but basic money is
[3899.48 - 3904.32] required for survival for good education
[3901.92 - 3906.56] travel quality time with the family
[3904.32 - 3908.88] having two support systems of domestic
[3906.56 - 3910.60] help is good but you have to pay them so
[3908.88 - 3912.72] the husband has to earn money second
[3910.60 - 3915.12] important thing he has to give quality
[3912.72 - 3917.56] education to the children and third give
[3915.12 - 3919.04] moral values teach them the difference
[3917.56 - 3921.28] or explain to them the difference
[3919.04 - 3923.20] between right and wrong absolutely so at
[3921.28 - 3926.00] every stage there are chanaka niis
[3923.20 - 3928.60] speaking of chanaka nitis in your life
[3926.00 - 3931.04] you've lost weight in between and you
[3928.60 - 3933.36] consciously did that uh you had a
[3931.04 - 3936.48] medical Scare at some point in your life
[3933.36 - 3938.00] was there a realization to losing weight
[3936.48 - 3940.16] what was your thought process would you
[3938.00 - 3942.56] like to share with the world how a guru
[3940.16 - 3945.80] of meditation decided to say that I
[3942.56 - 3948.20] don't need the medication right and my
[3945.80 - 3950.00] breath is in my control my thought is in
[3948.20 - 3953.12] my control and my health is in my
[3950.00 - 3954.60] control so what is your gift to the
[3953.12 - 3956.68] world what is your experience to the
[3954.60 - 3958.40] world from your body and health
[3956.68 - 3960.64] perspective so I'll tell you I've been
[3958.40 - 3964.48] very fortunate that the doctor that I
[3960.64 - 3966.64] went for treatment is my student only oh
[3964.48 - 3968.56] so I been lucky that I don't have
[3966.64 - 3971.08] doctors I have friends for doctors like
[3968.56 - 3973.88] you nutrition friend now so when I was
[3971.08 - 3975.36] admitted I still remember my wife my
[3973.88 - 3977.40] family everybody was taking care of me
[3975.36 - 3979.92] the doctor he's a student his name is Dr
[3977.40 - 3981.52] W so he comes to me and he ask me a very
[3979.92 - 3984.28] interesting question how do you
[3981.52 - 3986.16] visualize yourself 10 days from today
[3984.28 - 3988.60] the doctor asked you this and he was
[3986.16 - 3991.08] your student student of meditation and
[3988.60 - 3993.36] also at the Mumbai University where I ah
[3991.08 - 3996.32] okay so he know your mind so he decided
[3993.36 - 3998.52] to ask the guru this question so how do
[3996.32 - 4002.00] you visualize yourself so in hospital
[3998.52 - 4003.88] that time I visualize myself healthy
[4002.00 - 4005.80] strong and more fitter than what I'm
[4003.88 - 4007.88] today or what is in the past he said
[4005.80 - 4009.60] keep that thought with you doctors don't
[4007.88 - 4012.32] work with medicines they work with the
[4009.60 - 4014.32] mind of the patients wow doctors don't
[4012.32 - 4016.68] work with the medicines doctors work
[4014.32 - 4019.56] with the mind of the patients this is a
[4016.68 - 4021.48] meditation Guru who's saying this and
[4019.56 - 4023.44] that's very powerful another Goosebump
[4021.48 - 4025.96] moment today so when he told me this you
[4023.44 - 4028.68] know for me I said okay the medicines
[4025.96 - 4030.44] are required the healing part of it the
[4028.68 - 4032.12] treatment part of it is there but
[4030.44 - 4034.32] finally how do you visualize yourself
[4032.12 - 4036.96] you're speaking about sports person they
[4034.32 - 4039.24] visualize themselves of even before they
[4036.96 - 4041.40] go to play the game so finally health is
[4039.24 - 4043.12] also a mind game coming back consciously
[4041.40 - 4045.68] then you have to do the steps given by
[4043.12 - 4047.36] experts like you follow this do this do
[4045.68 - 4048.92] do this I followed that but I'll tell
[4047.36 - 4051.92] you a story it happened in my family
[4048.92 - 4053.96] with my father when he was in his 40s he
[4051.92 - 4056.08] was admitted and I still remember as a
[4053.96 - 4059.60] child but he became more healthy today
[4056.08 - 4061.96] at 89 years he climbed the Himalayas wow
[4059.60 - 4063.40] he still goes by local train and I used
[4061.96 - 4065.32] to always wonder you know how come he's
[4063.40 - 4068.04] so healthy at this St he's a role model
[4065.32 - 4070.12] he said at 40 I became conscious of my
[4068.04 - 4072.88] health and today I'm more fitter than
[4070.12 - 4075.72] many of them around I think one of the
[4072.88 - 4078.84] reasons I wanted to meet with you was to
[4075.72 - 4081.40] dwell into the power of the mind and you
[4078.84 - 4083.88] can't become a better version of
[4081.40 - 4086.60] yourself by eating better Dal chavel
[4083.88 - 4088.40] Roti I seriously believe this because
[4086.60 - 4091.24] when you put that food into your body
[4088.40 - 4093.56] your mind is also telling that body how
[4091.24 - 4095.92] it's accepting that food so I think even
[4093.56 - 4098.32] when you are not well you can come out
[4095.92 - 4100.84] of that you know back foot that you're
[4098.32 - 4102.96] on by just telling your mind with
[4100.84 - 4104.60] meditation with thought process that
[4102.96 - 4107.96] you're going to come out in the front
[4104.60 - 4110.44] those sunkit words here Anna and Mana
[4107.96 - 4113.00] Anna is food Mana is mind they're
[4110.44 - 4116.04] interconnected so Ana paana was there
[4113.00 - 4118.60] and now is Anna and Mana Anna and mana
[4116.04 - 4121.24] mana is mind Anna is f so F and mind are
[4118.60 - 4124.48] also related three things that you do
[4121.24 - 4127.32] from a food perspective eat less okay
[4124.48 - 4129.40] eat consciously okay and eat right the
[4127.32 - 4131.20] quality and the substance that you eat I
[4129.40 - 4133.76] think in his previous life he was a
[4131.20 - 4135.24] nutritionist before he he came into this
[4133.76 - 4136.40] and we best friends collaborating with
[4135.24 - 4137.88] each
[4136.40 - 4139.72] I'm sure a lot of people have asked you
[4137.88 - 4142.00] this question if chanaka would have been
[4139.72 - 4144.40] alive what would be the three problems
[4142.00 - 4147.28] that he would have solved in today's
[4144.40 - 4149.24] world to make our youngsters have a
[4147.28 - 4151.40] better Universe a better thought process
[4149.24 - 4155.56] a better life three things you have
[4151.40 - 4158.44] focused on leadership leadership
[4155.56 - 4161.44] leadership we require good leaders we
[4158.44 - 4164.60] require spiritual leaders and we require
[4161.44 - 4167.72] result oriented leaders can you expand
[4164.60 - 4170.04] on this we spoke about leadership a lot
[4167.72 - 4173.60] and chak wrote the book on
[4170.04 - 4176.84] leadership every team every society
[4173.60 - 4178.80] every country requires good leaders even
[4176.84 - 4180.60] a family requires good leaders right
[4178.80 - 4182.52] true you're living in an apartment or a
[4180.60 - 4184.32] society you require a good chairman
[4182.52 - 4186.32] there so I think leadership is the
[4184.32 - 4189.04] requirement of every particular
[4186.32 - 4190.76] Community institution or country chak
[4189.04 - 4192.44] created that it's like attack the top
[4190.76 - 4195.48] correct it everything is okay but
[4192.44 - 4197.88] important is also the spiritual leaders
[4195.48 - 4199.00] ship leadership can become a power game
[4197.88 - 4200.88] and we' seen that in so many
[4199.00 - 4203.12] organization right and what does
[4200.88 - 4206.60] opposition have to do only
[4203.12 - 4208.92] oppose so please understand that
[4206.60 - 4211.00] spiritual leadership has got the quality
[4208.92 - 4213.12] of leading the people without an ego
[4211.00 - 4216.52] therefore the ideal leader for chak is
[4213.12 - 4216.52] called Raji
[4216.76 - 4221.36] Raji is detached wow and please
[4220.00 - 4222.88] understand the day comes you to live
[4221.36 - 4226.48] don't even think back there's a very
[4222.88 - 4229.20] famous saying genius is know is a person
[4226.48 - 4230.68] who knows when to stop M so suppose
[4229.20 - 4232.72] you're a leader and you're given a 5year
[4230.68 - 4234.80] term people want that second term fifth
[4232.72 - 4236.48] term 20 ter it's okay if people won't
[4234.80 - 4238.12] elect you but lot of people can't give
[4236.48 - 4239.96] up leadership position and only a
[4238.12 - 4241.64] spiritual leader knows when to give up
[4239.96 - 4243.40] not give up you know just that
[4241.64 - 4246.04] responsibility will continue after the
[4243.40 - 4247.88] position goes therefore the last point
[4246.04 - 4250.32] of leadership is that the leader should
[4247.88 - 4252.28] be highly qualitative leader who is
[4250.32 - 4254.00] result oriented so leader comes and I'll
[4252.28 - 4255.88] build a ro or let's say you know I will
[4254.00 - 4258.12] create 20 part
[4255.88 - 4260.64] but you'll be happy only when the 20th
[4258.12 - 4262.92] podcast is actually broadcasted you not
[4260.64 - 4265.76] rest till then so I think leaders have
[4262.92 - 4268.12] so many dimensions J spoke about and
[4265.76 - 4270.24] this is beyond Generations so all of you
[4268.12 - 4272.12] please understand have a spiritual base
[4270.24 - 4274.36] think about being a leader of youri
[4272.12 - 4274.36] don't
[4276.84 - 4281.80] compare decide a of entrepreneurs you
[4280.40 - 4284.16] decide which field you want to but
[4281.80 - 4285.52] become a leader have a spiritual base as
[4284.16 - 4288.24] we discussed you know it's important to
[4285.52 - 4291.12] even meditate for leaders and finally if
[4288.24 - 4294.24] you take up a task stop not till your
[4291.12 - 4296.32] goal is achieved stop not till your goal
[4294.24 - 4299.20] is achieved which means also be
[4296.32 - 4300.56] relentless to your goal absolutely you
[4299.20 - 4302.32] have to deliver results that's
[4300.56 - 4304.60] leadership true you can't just be a
[4302.32 - 4306.76] floating leader and not deliver result
[4304.60 - 4309.48] at the end of the day Dr P it's been an
[4306.76 - 4312.12] amazing session with you today and a
[4309.48 - 4314.48] question out of ancient sagely wisdom to
[4312.12 - 4316.40] wrap up today's podcast if Dr P was
[4314.48 - 4318.32] stuck on an island and he could choose
[4316.40 - 4320.04] only five foods to take with him and
[4318.32 - 4323.20] they don't have to be nutritious what
[4320.04 - 4326.20] would be his five favorite foods fruits
[4323.20 - 4327.72] Foods aord yes yeah so you can take five
[4326.20 - 4330.24] maybe I'll be a little bit liberal you
[4327.72 - 4331.68] can take 10 foods but five foods that
[4330.24 - 4333.48] you would love to take with you if you
[4331.68 - 4335.64] were stuck on an island and you had no
[4333.48 - 4338.08] communication with any other island or
[4335.64 - 4340.16] the rest of the world so can I rephrase
[4338.08 - 4342.44] the question yeah will the food be only
[4340.16 - 4344.24] limited to something that I eat because
[4342.44 - 4347.04] my answer contains something Beyond just
[4344.24 - 4349.68] the food I take for eating so can can we
[4347.04 - 4352.28] take the physicality of food five items
[4349.68 - 4356.64] and the other five foods that Dr P has
[4352.28 - 4358.68] in mind Apple okay uh dry fruits which
[4356.64 - 4360.44] includes your almonds to and these are
[4358.68 - 4361.92] stuff that you really like of course
[4360.44 - 4364.80] your favorite favorites and the third
[4361.92 - 4367.04] one is curd okay I don't know why I love
[4364.80 - 4368.80] Cur these are three fruits but along
[4367.04 - 4371.76] with that I will carry
[4368.80 - 4374.40] books that's my you need you need food
[4371.76 - 4378.12] for the brain absolutely and I'll carry

[4378.12 - 4383.48] days in the island all

[4383.48 - 4390.24] whom I hope to now have as a best friend
[4386.76 - 4392.72] for life because the mind has no
[4390.24 - 4396.88] boundaries but the mind has boundaries
