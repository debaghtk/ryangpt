Transcript: so on that note Ryan over to you I'm not going to make you go pink but thank you thank you we will have Ryan has a presentation we will uh have Ryan walk us through that and then there's a set of questions that I'll ask Ryan and if you have any questions you can uh feel free to put it up in the chat or we will have a q a session towards the end um thank you so much thank you garima thank you everyone for joining in on a Saturday um promise to add value to all of you here today in the seminar um I'm going to share my screen I I love to I would love to start with this first slide um shweta is my screen sharing yes it is you lived in Bangalore you probably know that this is UB City uh the malayata is there in the background and it's probably the most expensive real estate in Bangalore yeah I recently discovered Hong Kong is the most expensive real estate in the world we did a Google app for it and and I want to place this to anyone watching in or listening in the most expensive real estate uh is you ever thought about that I recently bought my home in Bangalore and after I bought it I was like yeah it's a second-hand home but I'm gonna do up the walls I'm gonna do up the floor I'm going to do up the bathroom and then as I was scrubbing some of the TAPS in the bathroom you know where at the bottom of the Basin like I was cleaning another houses mine I want to clean it so imagine that's your human body and you actually owned your body and now your liver had to be cleaned up your cartilage had to be cleaned up so most of us go through life with this thought process our body is somebody else we are tenants in it think about it are you the really the landlord of your body and if you're the landlord of your body you will not Miss I think it's Ryan's Network shweta has my presentation stopped because my screen has frozen we can hear you now okay um okay you can hear me so so basically the the whole idea over here is to start everyone on this process which is whatever you spend your money on I would like to convince you that spend a little bit lesser on your house a little bit lesser on your Gucci bag a little bit lesser on your A6 running shoes a little bit lesser on your Maldives trip and a little bit more on the food that you eat what you put into you is the equivalent of me thinking about putting Italian versus putting vitrified tiles and it's now my own house that I bought so I'm thinking should I should I not oh it's like 150 rupees more expensive per square foot and the same logic does it apply to your body so most Runners that I have met in my life do Nam give us their nutrition they use they use running as the nutritional stick or latte or discipline to get you to the next level so you know from a perspective just a moment from a perspective where you want to be working the screen has frozen just a moment can you hear me because my laptop is completely Frozen and I don't know if it's with the zoom we can hear you but I think um stop sharing and share again maybe yeah I'm just stopping sharing uh just a moment Murphy's law says things will hang when you want it to not hang so my screen is completely Frozen um the logic now the logic now is to completely reboot the laptop which will take me about a minute and a half to come back no what you could do is you could please mail it to shweta and she could display it or yeah you might have an email ID now the problem is my screen has completely Frozen everything is Frozen everything is frozen it is never done that it's enough so we can wait till you come back that's just just a moment just a moment I'm seeing if I can end the task I'll just I'll just come back on this okay sure sorry guys okay slow Ryan you want to whatever your whatever you do or whatever you own if I can just leave you with the first thought and the only thought of today which is what's the brand of your body so I believe I'm a Rolls-Royce so I would ask vinod I would ask Rama I would ask Amber I would ask Jay whoever's in here Praveen done my what brand are you and think of your body as a vehicle or something very elite and the act of eating uh is the raw material to build this real estate to maintain this real estate to preserve this is so so from from that from that perspective let me start off with two three things there's something known as shelf life of every cell the only thing that you don't change in your entire body is your eyes everything else turns over turns over means uh like for example the hair on my head is not the same when I was 10 years younger every seven months you change a hair follicle so to produce the hair follicle and the hair that comes out from your hair follicle it is the nutrition that goes into you so as a sports nutritionist when I am called upon to produce an Olympic level performance or somebody goes for the MDS somebody goes for the marathon subless they want performance they want run time we are looking at the structure of the cell but it's like you've given me a house and you've called me as an interior decorator to make your internal rooms look better shine more run faster but what I would like in today's seminar because I see a lot of gray hair like me in this presentation uh which is these are the Masters and above older Runners which means you want to run till you're 70 years of age but how do you not have this real estate breakdown so now you don't contract a sports nutritionist to do the interior decoration but you come in and say I need an architect I need an architect because I know that every 14 years 14 years 14 years I turn over my muscle cell and every eight years I turn over my uh fat cells my blood cells is four months my brain cells almost never turn over my neurons never turn over so when I present this picture to you it's not about it's not about do you follow a diet it's about how aware are you about the science of what you put into your body so having said that there are two three things that I would love for you to do one if money is not an issue and it should not be an issue because your real estate is the most expensive real estate on the planet if you own a house that's one two three crores and you have not done a genetic test or blood test then you're living in a slum think about it you have never invested as much on the science yeah you're buying you're doing personal best you're running for the fun of it but my logic to you is have you seen 50 years ahead I have because I have an 88 year old marathon runner who comes to me and says I wish I had done this nutrition when I was 50. so that I wouldn't have catastrophically damaged the turnover of that room inside of my body it could be the liver it could be the heart it could be the kidneys it could be the pancreas it could be the muscle it could be the cartilage it could be um the bones for example a lot of women do not know that they have the osteoporosis or the osteoarthritis Gene what is gene Gene is the software code in the human body that you inherited from your mother and father so I would love for you to understand in the software code are you thumbs up or you thumbs down for example I have a magnesium Gene that is thumbs down so I cram very easily in my carbs but the moment I take a magnesium supplement on a daily basis now Puritan would say no no you shouldn't take a supplement on a daily basis but I do know that my Gene is a thumbs down therefore I need to take a magnesium supplement to prevent crime cramping so I can do my karate class foreign so my logic to everyone out here is if you do a nutrition Gene test and a fitness Gene test you get an astrology or a crystal ball gazing into your future and that's how I work as a magician so people are like oh yeah Ryan's given me this time and all I'm not giving you any timing I've just gone in and understood your architectural blueprint which is the blood test and which is the genetic test now once you get that then we get into who are the people going in and out of this building which the building is you if you haven't got the synonym by now and how are you feeding this building what are the choices of food when are you putting it what is the timing is there any science behind the logic of you putting in a banana before a run or you're doing a fasted State training let me tell you in 25 years of doing this no two people are the same including you get brother and sister or brother and brother or sister and sister in the same family there is a genetic diversity except in identical twins the genetic diversity results in you making better or worse food choices and so when shweta said at the beginning of this lecture that Ryan wherever I am I call him up he says you can eat it but those four five Riders are me remembering what are the gene sets in her and I don't say no but I ask is that something that you want to be doing given the fact that you know what is a front foot for you and what is a back foot for you front foot meaning the genes working for you back foot means the gene is not working for you um so so from this perspective I wanted to talk about just your real estate being the most expensive thing so shweta what I will do is I will take the questions because it'll be better for people to in this session to get their questions and queries answered so we would have the next 45 minutes just to go and Rapid Fire and get the questions answered perfect okay so we'll start with I think the very very basic question of this whole macro and micro which uh you know a lot of people have a lot of questions about them what are the macros how important they are what are the micros how do we uh you know and maybe some food examples that uh fall into each of the categories and uh you know its role in in the sport explaining macro and micro uh with some examples and and the role in place so let me uh I'm just seeing if I can open that that one slide that I created just give me a second yeah I got it Okay so macro and micro Greek words macro means large micro means small um imagine your body has three fuel sources you're a car you get you get petrol you get diesel and you get Electric so you got protein carbs and fat depending on your genetic predisposition some of us are amazing carb burners some of us are amazing fat burners and some line between the protein is the building block the protein is the macro the carb is the macro the fat is the macro macro means it gives the calorie content we is nutritionist when we plan A nutrition plan you know people think oh just do Italy to those are two Paratha two Biryani you know and that's it's very general I can do this myself but from an Olympic level perspective let me tell you when we work with boxers when we work with Taekwondo when we work with wrestlers which is way to manage Sports I can get a boxer to 60 kgs one day uh before the boxing finals when the actual body weight is 72 kgs I did that with sushil Kumar I've done it with half a dozen boxes it doesn't it cannot be done overnight but it can be done over a six to eight week period and you do that by controlling your Macros your protein your carbs and your fats so as a runner these are your fuel sources I can't give you a generic statement but I can tell you as a runner if you have crossed the age of 50 aim to get 1.5 grams per kg body weight of protein so let's say Mr vinod is 72 kgs or 73 kgs um I would give Mr vinod 72 into 1 which is 73.5 is half of 70 35 about 100 to 105 grams of protein now with the vegetarian or non-vegetarian I have a discussion with the client in terms of what is their dietary preference then I go after the food sources to build it into his program now if a said individual has too much of body fat percentage on their body okay I call them the petrol tanks so the fuel tanks around your waist or your hip or your bum which is most of the places where we store our fat reserves those could be tanks which could help you in running provided you know how to tweak your carbohydrate down or tweak your carbohydrate up so sounds little bit confusing let me see if my screen shares oh so Ryan uh question on that is you said 73 grams of protein yes so how much protein should one intake uh in terms of broadly between veg and non-veg to get that much of protein because uh so so normally when we work it's like this okay again it was 73 kg man would require 1.5 if it's a 50 kg woman she'd require 75 grams of protein because it's 1.5 into 50 kgs 75 grams of protein now how we do it is it's a very simple equation wherein how many meals a day would you eat so if you eat five meals a day divide by five or three major meals divide by three and keep two or two small meals which is your pre-workout and post workout snackers two small meals and call that a major meal so four so 75 divided by 4 which is roughly 20 sorry 20 grams a per meat so shweta what I would do is then I would split that 20 grams per meal now if I'm a vegetarian I would look at what food sources would give me 25 grams of protein so is it 100 grams as a cup of beans that I need to eat or is it multiple some beans some Dal some soy or some paneer or some curd or a glass of milk so put that as a vegetarian sauce if it's a non-wet source like this morning I had my non-veg breakfast I was looking at everything oh okay I'm doing five with the pumps I'm doing uh two eggs so the two eggs are 12 grams of protein the water pump has about um 10 grams of protein in that total because more Dal can then uh yeah 25 grams oh yeah I'm covered oh wow I forgot up my baked beans to reduce my cholesterol so I do a whole cup of baked beans and then there was a salmon fish and I looked at it and I was like I'm already full though South Indian breakfast on Saturday was just too much so I was like okay not eating the salmon salmon alone was about 120 grams weight which would have given me another 30 grams of protein so I think if you start breaking down your Macros that way in looking at the protein content then you go to the carbohydrate content now most Delight Runners have a very good fat percentage so shweta like I make you go in continuously to get a body composition assessment done I I wish to ask this group how many of you and and maybe just let me know in the chat box um you know um how many of the chat box would um have done the body composition so just type in yes or no just just to have uh just to have a basic understanding of how many of you have done a body composition and in the body composition very good I'm getting many many yeses you need to know your fat composition your visceral fat and your muscle mass okay now once you have this information it's like saying I know how many bedrooms are there in my house I know how many kitchens are there how many Halls are there I mean kitchens and Halls is like if you're uh a billionaire in this audience but you get my gist right you need to know what's the con construct now when a person specifically a man has more than 25 percent body fat I'd like to bring it down if a woman has more than 30 body fat I'd like to bring it down women ideally speaking child bearing face should be 25 to 30 if you're not looking to have children 20 to 25 percent is a great fat percentage below 20 you're a rock star men below 15 percent um you don't need to come to a nutritionist okay uh 15 to 25 work on it um and that's where I would say do the body composition to then begin to understand how to feed your Macros so if I were to put the bricks on carbohydrate as a marathon runner we can use protein amino acids and uh uh things like L-Carnitine or B complex to go and Latte the fat out of your body okay um so so it's I can't do it in a 45 minute lecture it's like a six hour Workshop that I actually found a runner's Workshop that I did for six hours and I took us at the slide that you're seeing is one of the slides from that six hour Workshop so that will be the macros and then you come to the micros micros are your vitamins and minerals um I'm I'm gonna paste uh I'm gonna paste in um a blood test link um and those of you do a blood test if you click on this link it takes you to a page I've constructed which is the nutritionist choice of blood test which is a general blood test and then you have the vitamins and minerals and I also have the heavy metals and also I have food allergy blood tests if money is not an issue get all of them done once a year the reason being is and let me tell you the logic the logic is this the general blood test the liver the enzyme the kidney enzyme you do it twice a year you know if the running is damaging your body please understand when you run you break down cellular structure in you which puts a load on your liver and kidney and all the detoxification systems in your body so if you're not feeding correctly you're not born with the right genes to recover you're actually killing yourself to a certain extent you're killing your muscle your muscle is damaging too much it goes and puts load on liver and kidney I have had people in CrossFit rhabdolysis which is they Hammer up the body so badly that they go into toxic mode but you don't do that you know you're taking rest you're eating well I'm assuming that so the when you come into the micronutrients why did I go to the blood test because I genuinely do not take a multivitamin and let me tell you why I'm the guy that launched Amway Nutrilite in India I was one of the first employees in 1999 okay I worked with them for three years to build the neutralite model in India and educate people about and Amway deal is one of my preferred prescription choices in the multivitamin Centrum is their first form from the US and my all-time favorite shweta knows is trevo it's 174 fruit and vegetable extract from the US you don't get it in India it's a liquid multivitamin it's I think it's like the Lamborghini of vitamin and minerals you can get a bottle of it and start taking one or two tablespoons a day covers everything that you need but I don't take it why because in this link I've sent you I do all the vitamin and mineral blood test and if any one of them go down whether my B2 so I keep tracking my B6 and my B9 and I keep tracking my zinc and magnesium because my genetic receptors told me that these four don't absorb well so when I check my blood test and I look like oh it's all normal do I need to take a multivitamin no because I'm eating my food correctly so your food the Indian farmer should be planting it in correct soil and stuff like that and you should be getting the micronutrients the bad news is that the micronutrients in the soil has come so the palak today as compared to the palak that my grandmother ate my grandmother got a more nutritive micro nutrition in the in the vegetables and the fruits as compared to what we get today so I'm not saying that you need to take a supplement I'm saying do the blood test be aware how often well if if like I have got I've got one of these guys who's billionaires money is not an issue he does the blood test every month so like right I need to know if it goes down even by 10 points like if I watch the stock market why not my own body so I think once a month is like too much once a quarter is perfect if you're above 50 uh once every six months uh if you're a runner have to do it every six months uh and if you're not a runner in this forum then at least once a year you do the blood test if you do the blood test shweta can give you um my email ID and then I can help you um get in touch with a person on my team who can guide you that hey this is wrong that's wrong but in terms of the micro nutrition in Runners my all-time favorite is magnesium for the men and women uh calcium specifically more for the women after I do a blood test because of osteoporosis because as your estrogen drops As you move towards menopause your bone mineral density drops so when you do that dexa scan dexa scan I'll just type it up d-e-x-a dexa is the gold standard for doing your body composition sorry I've jumped from blood test to dexa scan why because this calcium is in your bone minerals men also should do it above the age of 50 but please do the dexa scan only once once a year because it's a radiation CT scan once a year don't do it more than that other than that you can do the in body or like I have this one weighing scale over here in my clinic which is called the Omron garada scan which gives you the overall I'll just type it up for everyone Omron garada hbf I think it's hbf965 if I'm not mistaken or something like that you'll get on Amazon 9 900 rupees it gives you four measures of the area check of fat in your whole body your trunk your arms and your legs and the same for muscle whole body muscle whole body arms whole body trunk whole body legs and visceral fat and body age so kind of that when you take it on a monthly basis you know your body composition you do your blood tests every six months you get to know if you're feeding the raw materials you're giving in the macro and micros are really clear all over the place and things like chromium things like selenium things like sod so the minerals of micro is sodium and potassium Runners need to be very careful on the sodium and potassium uh because sometimes they sweat so much they lose so much of sodium potassium goes to the roof potassium taken in high quantities can cause a heart attack also all the runners need to do is understand that they're losing sweat and if you taste your sweat it's very salty salt is sodium sodium is five times the loss of sodium to one time of potassium so the moment I find somebody who has potassium High it means they've lost too much of sodium right the problem lies in those who have blood pressure problems you can't give too much of sodium so that's where medical supports nutrition comes into play and I've had people with stents with bypass with high BP who are Runners who are triathletes and we we work on um uh from from a perspective next question Ryan uh would you talk a little bit about D3 because uh I know a lot of people who when when and if they do a test say that the D3 is like too low yeah and I think that's the most common thing that I hear from people uh you know the world is evolving artificial intelligence is coming in and so everyone's getting this awareness and knowledge but I remember in 2012 when I used to bet with people the whole cost of their diet counseling if your vitamin D3 is not low I'll refund the cost of the money of your counseling because I knew that Indians are 70 to 80 percent most likely and in 2012 nobody had this under on uh understanding on so even doctors and I knew that vitamin D uh was was most prevalent because you start doing it with 20 athletes and all 20 athletes who eat really well they're in the sun all the time with their shirt off and their youngsters and they have vitamin D deficiency imagine us fuddy duddies you know uh what's going to happen to our bodies so vitamin D kind of um I think the issue is because we are dark skinned number one and then we are in shortened band and how many of us I mean we Indians I am from Goa and if I go to the beach I I I will go with a t-shirt on and uh and full gym trousers and I will not go with uh shots and you know expose the Sun and stuff like so the Indians have this aversion towards sun bathing and stuff like that yes sunbathing I've seen in athletes and even in clients um it goes up by five or ten points I think we have lower vitamin D because of the skin because of the insecticides pesticides in our food chain which affect the activation of the vitamin D in the kidneys and so you take a vitamin D test blood test uh do it every quarter uh it's a lifelong supplement everyone I would I I do vitamin D twice a month a 60 000 IU I do a liquid one from Abbott laborities called aricatol I think it's a better one vitamin D aracatal 1mg you can erectiles 60 000. people talk about D rise and other things yeah yeah that's all okay and I found this one because it's it's a liquid its absorption is far far better because the granules I think can just go through and pass through you and don't dissolve as well as a nanopateicalized uh one an injection sometimes is the best thing that you can do but Runners have stopped recommending injections because the doctors tend to not understand they poke the people on the thigh or the bum and then you have that nodular vitamin D there for about 30-45 days and that hurts for for people who are on us so if you're getting the vitamin D injection get in the upper part of your body um but otherwise just the 60 000 IU would work very interestingly vitamin D is the Barb of testosterone so when vitamin D is low testosterone is low both for males and female if even females require testosterone males yes as you're growing older if your testosterone drops below 400 try getting your vitamin D levels to 60 to 70 nanograms so 3200 is the range everyone's like so sorry minus 31 32 it's like you saying I'm at the bottom of my class in school and you're very excited about it I'd like you to be middle of the class or top of the class so the the problem is um people think that if they come to the borderline low level like I have a client 218 in vitamin B12 means like mine's 222 no it's okay now so your liver holds 10 years version your liver holds 10 years version of uh B12 if it has come down to 222 it means in the last decade you have been fooling around I know vitamin D has your vitamin B12 has come down so the vitamin B's and vitamin C's are water soluble you pee them out you sweat them out and Runners have chronically low B and C levels not to mention you do not know whether your genetic predisposition because you have not done your genetic receptor test we live in 2023. people have got the latest watches latest phones latest flute boards in their Halls uh double paned windows in their houses to escape pollution and heat and everything but when it comes to understanding the body and diet everyone's wigging it so I would say please get the genetic test done you will thank me 25 years later saying oh Ryan you told me to do this and whoever I'm meeting now 20 years later I have advised in the olden days I remember doing the first genetic test in India in 2006 with ran backseat for the actn sprinting Gene I was the first guy to ask for it and run back say like no doctors ever asked for it the reason is you want to know the crystal ball gazing for the future so you can make the interventions via nutrition any other questions let's move on to more questions or people have questions yeah so next question is uh carb protein and fat that you mentioned uh as a runner typically who does say average running training for a half or a full Marathon what kind of a mix of that should they take because there are a lot of males people say oh more protein less fat there's that all kinds you could you I know it's very generic it's not like but at least indicative figure for people who who are in this group to get some ideas and especially the myth that because you're a runner you need to have extra carb before race day carb loading everybody's doing pasta parties and stuff like that so I think just just some some light on on that question um this slide on glycogen who is glycogen glycogen is the combination of the carbs stored in the muscle I want you to imagine like this this small fuel tank is there in between the muscles you'll have packets of glycogen and in your liver you will have glycogen glycogen is the carb resource store no matter how much of pasta party you do you cannot go beyond this 90 minutes of muscle through and 90 minutes is an elite athlete most of us will be at 45 minutes okay and by the way this this one is for all the women in the audience listen in closely one gram of glycogen holds three molecules of water okay you have about 800 grams of glycogen that can be stored in your muscle so 800 grams into three 2.4 liters of water is stored in your body in your muscle so when people do low carb diet boom they've lost three cages I lost weight but they stop the diet and the three kgs comes back that three kg is up and down is nothing but glycogen and water in your body it's a transitionary stage so any weight loss of one to three KGS is fictitious from a from I need to get a better body composition you always want to be looking at your fat so when you take carbohydrate if you're in the weight loss running mode I would say you need lesser than 200 grams of carbs per day to latte the fat out of your body if you're in a running mode and you shouldn't do weight loss mode in Marathon preparation so I would do fat loss in off season mode and the lead time for your Marathon preparation should be 120 days 4 months in those four months you're replenishing these carbs every day in that time depending on your body weight um 60 40 60. so it's about anywhere from 40 to 90 grams per kg body weight of carbs that need to be given to a person so let's say shweta somebody is there at 60 kgs then I would give them six into 40 grams so so about I would give about 2 16 16 to 4 sorry not forty four I would give them 60 I'm doing this all in my head right now 60 kgs I would give them four grams of carbohydrate per kg body weight so that'll be 240 grams that would be my equation right this is based on years of experience of just doing the permission calculation however if somebody's lean and skinny like me I could go up to up to five or six uh somebody's looking to lose weight I would be as conducive to come under that 200 so I do maybe three grams per kg body so 180 grams of carbohydrate with regards to fat 10 years from now they will say eat more fat it's not the cause of heart attack in fact they already think they removed the uh the the whole thing in America saying that fat is the cause of disease cholesterol is the cause of disease as per the ft and all it's it'll come to India slowly so this concept of full fat and half fat and low-fat milk and all I I don't think is the issue for the heart attacks and the blockages I think it's more the sugars in the diet the the the refined sugars and the flowers so when we say carb shweta I want to be looking at complex carbs coming in from fruit or coming in from vegetable or coming in let's say from my potato or my yam or my tapioca I'm not too happy getting my carbs from wheat jovar bajra rice corn flour because these are grains they cultivated their milled and then you take it in very concentrated so if you're doing a chapati I would like it to have more fiber in it and you know um balance it out well so when I come to the recommendation to people please do a balanced diet number one number two buy a nice table weighing scale which you can put on your uh you put a table weighing scale on your table and weigh your rice or your chapati work with the nutritionist to figure out what's the correct element and constantly be aware uh Beyond scientific tester do 100 grams of rice for a whole month see what it does to your body composition see what it does to your triglycerides and your blood test see what it does to your cholesterol in your blood test by the way carbs even affect your fat levels in your blood so when you start running and you start and most of you over here I don't know if I come from the time when we didn't have digital tuning so if you remember the car radios of FMS in the early 1900s the 1990s sorry you you had the fine knob and you had the big knob to tune into the radio station so use your exercise as the fine knob and use the big knob as your diet in terms of trying to tune into the best body weight that you can achieve the next question uh before she asked that I think there was a chat message Ryan about B12 supplement what is a good B12 supplement any thoughts on that so B12 most vegetarians because B12 is mostly found only in non-veg food governments across the world 45 milk and cereal with B12 the Indian government is just decided to start that policy in India also but step one vegetarians non-vegetarian check your B12 level step two if it is below 300 and you're a runner starts supplementing which supplement you can do a general multivitamin like a Supra then like a revital like a one a day like a A to Z uh a tree wolf from abroad a doctor mercolus from abroad or you can find something that's more of a natural multivitamin made from fruit and vegetable extract or you can go into specifics of a B12 specifics of a B12 could be like you could do a Becca joules you could do a Becca zyme you could do neural Beyond um I personally do a sublingual which is I put a B12 dropper under the tongue uh Nature's Bounty has one it's getting a little bit more difficult to get it off the internet because the fssai has passed a rule now that all online sold nutraceutical supplements cannot have a high RDA and most nutritional B complexes are at clinical doses which will be available only in your Pharmacy so you may need to talk to your doctor about giving you a b complex there's a company called well-being which has um melts melts are strips that dissolve when you put it into your mouth I have my daily dose over here let me see if I can find it foreign I'm not endorsing it I don't endorse this company I just personally use it so I get I get a melt like this out and uh it's not a tablet it's a strip so if you can see that over there it's it's a it's a strip just a piece of paper which contains B12 and I put it onto my tongue and that's it it melts and that gives me my daily dose of B12 and it's a vegan B12 pretty nice flavor so from that perspective you can do a B12 that way also you can do B12 shots because certain people who have the gene receptor for B12 deficiency there's something known as intrinsic factor in the stomach anyone who has acidity or gut problems will not absorb B12 very well through the oral root intrinsic factors like a lock and key model so the B12 is then intrinsic factor goes and catches B12 and takes it for absorption so many people are born without the intrinsic factor production many people have acidity or gut problems the the lock and key doesn't work so you might want to take the B12 injections every four months do not think of it as medicine think of it as nutrition and tomorrow that you got the B12 deficiency Gene so think of it from that perspective and take the the medical intervention it's only nutrition it's not a medicine I see many of you smiling about the mummy daddy Ka Jody and anything that happens whenever they're like yeah Mommy I inherited from yourself my mother look at my father no no that is from your father's side so so if your face if you face The Mummy daddy arguments then your nutrition can also be blamed and your running performance can also be blamed on your mom and dad uh Ryan next question is on hydration because most are Runners and especially uh you know uh heat running uh and then of course in the follow-up question is also about salting things so you could Club the two because I'm taking watching time as well so hydration and salt um when you sweat you lose water you lose um uh salts what are the salts um and it's also sodium potassium magnesium chloride I recently designed a an isotonic sports drink um I've helped the lady break the Guinness World Record of non-stop aerobics of 26 hours um about a decade ago and the Apollo doctor in Hyderabad told her that um you won't be able to do this record your body stats are good your heart is amazing your ECG blah blah blah everything but you won't be able to complete this record because you will cramp human endurance cannot sustain that sort of level of 26 hours of aerobics and then that she asked the doctor how will it she said so doctor says you need to have go and find uh an amazing uh person who will design a designer solution for you so you keep hydrating or you keep taking infusions uh every 15 minute break that you get every four hours and then they figured out they couldn't get the drip to and enter into the bloodstream in 15 minutes every four hour break so then they realize they needed to do a hydration beverage so I was contacted to be the guy that designed the solution the lady did 26 hours of non-stop aerobics Guinness World Record now why am I sharing this with you if an athlete crabs if an athlete's muscle doesn't fire if a must athlete runs slower it's because they are sweating when they sweat they lose water water is very easy to replace but the salt has to be a five is to one five sodium to one potassium this makes it an isotonic solution for my electrolyte balance point of view where the osmolarity osmolarity means like if you step into my room now that the AC here and the AC in the corridor is almost the same because this is set at 25 and outside Corridor is set at 25. so the air will circulate quite ambiently but if inside is 19 degree celsius and outside is 25 this air will rush out similarly in your body when you sweat your blood becomes thicker and when your blood becomes thicker your heart rate goes up so you want to keep your blood thinner how do you keep your blood thinner you want plasma fluid to remain but for plasma flu to remain it shouts out of the stomach and in the Sun a by Pani dedo when Pani comes in plain this Pani that has come is plain Pani but inside we are very elite we're very very elite we have got glucose we have got salt we have got minerals we don't want this Sada Wala Pani so when you give water with a six percent glucose and fructose solution same to same let's pull it in quickly you take a 10 sugar solution so insulin will come out you'll get a sugar Spike and then you get a crash so you completely destroy a marathon running because you get a you get a sugar crash when running so you can't take a high sugar solution oh sir I take electoral solution oh electoral is designed for dehydration from diarrhea not running the addition from Diary is a different sweat system it is a poop stress system not a skin sweat system so that will give you only a three percent solution of electrolytes oh sorry uh glucose and no fructose so I designed this solution called one Chase I'm shamelessly advertising it here today on this forum but shweta has used it in the Sahara and uh she has shared it with Runners across the world and they were like that was a lifesaver there's nothing great about the formula it was just pure science by what its design now hydration is important don't do plain water I don't care your age and even if you're diabetic you need some amount of glucose and salt what about salt tablets salt tablets are good when you're training for a marathon in normal training and you're looking to lose body fat don't do my solution do a branch chain amino acid and electrolytes and water but no glucose and fructose so after 30 minutes of running you're choking out your muscle saying hey bye I'm not giving any glucose so in the bodies like are you buy we are not getting any glycogen is getting depleted we're going to shut down the brain fatigue fatigue no no this person is a crazy person can run oh take the latte and start beating fat out of the body but you gotta run where your heart rate is lower so that's conditioning that's another subject I can take two hours just explaining to you how to condition your heart back into place but um that you make salt and sugar is like running with no offense it's like running with power uh chapels power shoes you can't run in it but it's not going to get you that Elite timing so if you're running with A6 or Brooks or whatever it is or Vibrams or whatever it's running don't don't I see so many people they have the so the such expensive equipment car they turn up in they're doing like plain water like dudes what are you doing understand your body understand no no Gatorade is uh yeah get it it's bad because it's got artificial coloring in it but otherwise it's an amazing sports drink I'm not endorsing Gateway but I'm just telling you that people tend to without having the knowledge about something tend to shoot something down uh explained it yeah everyone please take a magnesium capsule at night great thing doesn't cause headaches uh makes your poop softer gives you deeper sleep uh softens your muscles whatever your age only those who have kidney stone problems get in touch with me will redesign your electrolyte solution otherwise everybody else drink enough of water uh you need a sports drink when you train more than one hour somebody said I sweat buckets um you need to do this simple equation dry clothes take your measurement start running so let's say your weight is 50 uh and then you run for one hour and you become 49 kg so you lost one kg of water one liter of water and how you drank 500 mL of what along the way so you've actually lost 1.5 liters so your sweat rate replenishment should be 1.5 liters in this 1.5 liters I can work out the calculation for you and do it for you um and it varies from person to person but the ideal equation is um in Runners is 50 ml per kg body weight for the whole day's production of water so if if I can ask um I mean I know I will ask somebody else over here srinivas if you're listening and what's your body weight 87 cages I'll make it easy 90 into five you require 4.5 liters of water per day as a marathon runner if you're running on a daily basis that's the total consumption 4.5 liters in the day so you know you got to figure it out how do you build it you you should not take most of your water content when you're running because it sloshes around inside your gut so I think ideal hydration rates in running would be about 500 to 700 ml per hour is ideal if you can go beyond a liter you're a rock star I mean you can really uh somebody said I lost five Keys away today after drinking three liters of water I weigh 75 kgs so that means your squishy your sweat rate is eight lit that's like do you cram cushy Khushi forgive me I don't know that's Girish okay and yes that he does cram but he didn't cramp today he says okay okay yeah so so then we need to have a higher salt content higher glucose content eight percent solution and then we do things like chia seed pudding before the run so that it holds 11 times its weight in water the chia seeds will give you hydration so a lot of strategy like that show us some more questions yes a lot of people have uh many point of views on supplements a lot of people say no no I don't want to take supplements why take supplements you know and this and that so some some insights from experts there and there's a question on intermittent fasting if time permits will try and go to it I'll be able to do a little longer if everyone wants to come in I'm actually enjoying myself the energy of this group is really cool I can only imagine if you all met up and go of what it what would happen uh um the the beer would have electrolyte tablets dropped into it did we just do with the bear we will we will just skip it we will do the cover loading that's all so I I once convinced uh I once convinced a runner to have a whiskey with Gatorade and after that the guy got hooked you're giving me ideas so so uh yeah when I come next time to gurgaon I'll meet up with everyone um what was the question again um I mean on supplements supplements this is my this is my signature statement supplements are a nutritional convenience for your nutritional in discipline if you are nutritionally disciplined you don't need supplements if you're genetically on the back foot you may need a supplement but if you're nutritionally disciplined and you know your genes are perfect and you're doing your blood test take my example I take a phosphodidyl serine phosphorylcholine supplement for my brain there's no deficiency only there I'm just biohacking I take a supplement from a company called decode age which is nmn it's called longevit now you don't need to take this I'll tell you what I've taken after I've designed my structure and I take a magnesium supplement the rest I don't take because I eat organic I eat an amazing amount of micro greens because that would contain my chlorophyll and hopefully my micro nutrition I try and buy hydroponic stuff because I know they're putting Goods uh the good what we call is fertilizer which is the natural fertilizer the organic fertilizer in it and they're not spraying it that much of insecticides and pesticides but people who do sport there is a depletion of nutrition because of the damage of the physical activity on the body and thereby because you're building because your rooms are being damaged things like collagen more vitamin B complex and C because they are both water soluble and you sweat and pee a lot are lost protein is higher because there is cellular and structural damage glucosamine a chondroitin sulfate and MSM for your cartilage and tissue are some of the key things electrolytes could be considered and so from from that perspective you could you could look at supplements are a thumbs up but the thing is that people do like I had this client last year they did their own supplementation regime and they did ayurveda along with that and they got heavy metal poisoning and they deliver went into damage and the client's hemoglobin dropped from 14 to 9. over a one year period because of the ayurvedic supplements and the heavy metals in it so I I think self-prescription of supplements and you know it's like oh my God yesterday I was on LinkedIn there was this elderly gentleman must be about 5560 is talking about nutrition and I'm like it's written Stanford school of medicine and I was like who is this Indian I've never heard of I went and looked at his profile he's a VC I I almost lost it yesterday I was like I want to go public lunch profile and say you are not allowed to talk about nutrition by doing a certificate course in Stanford I'm sorry but I want to call out these influences out there and if you are doing it as you know we have we have running coaches who prescribe diet shots Ghanta these guys know anything yeah and you on the other hand want to take advice from such people just because they're like oh they ran so much of distance so they are also subject matter experts on nutrition is that you coming to me coming to me and saying Ryan give me my training schedule for Marathon running I've never run in my life so don't get influenced by ads about supplements people who takes up oh my friend shweta is taking collagen look at his skin glow I should also take collagen do it scientifically or do you service your own iPhone and Apple watch on your car yourself what can juicy stuff that people do yeah on their body sometimes I get irritated the guys wearing a freaking Rolex and then wanting to do supplement protein strategy Ryan tell me what protein did you do a food allergy test one guy came to me liver damage uh grade one fatty liver I said I've been training for the last 30 years in the gym and all 60 grams of protein every day I did his emu Pro is a German blood test for food allergy he says sorry 38 000 rupees for the blood test guys wearing a Rolex so Alexa please just do it listen to me comes back that he's allergic to casein he's allergic to whey he is allergic to Dairy and the only milk he can drink is camel milk not not cow milk not goat milk so this gives a whole list he's been taking whey protein for the last 30 years guess what his grade 1 fatty liver he refuses to believe me is the cause from his whey protein intake no no sir I drink and I got alcohol and I got all of this thing three months three months on a proper diet is sgot sgpt ggt are the liver enzymes began to drop so the supplementation by self-prescription harms the body supplementation under influencer advice or like for example that I won't name the companies they they do come to me and they ask me to recommend them but for example yesterday I saw Taekwondo super Champion forget that cricketers are talking about the supplement like Virat Kohli is talking about a supplement you should take his nutritionist who gave him all the supplement prescription so how can he endorse and say that this is a supplement you need when it is bio individual so wherever you go in the world do not misuse your personal real estate go proper do the correct testing and this is a simple test you want to do it on your own buy a supplement take a blood test check your resting heart rate take it for one month check your resting heart rate check your blood test if all parameters remain the same or improve it's a thumbs up but do not take the advice because of an ad or an influencer or because your next door neighbor is doing it it that that would be detrimental and that's my position on supplement I worked for the three two best supplement companies in the world before I started my quantitation clinics because every time we went to sell a supplement everyone said buy bolo green tea protein powder Herbal Life so first get your Dal travel Roti in alignment and then get a nutritional supplement it's like I don't know if you've seen in gurgaon and all we will see that old zen vehicle with a Ferrari sticker on it you get my picture it's not a Ferrari she's Assuming he's a Ferrari because he's put a Ferrari sticker he's assumed he's taking supplements so he's going to run faster Roti it the foundation is not perfect so focus on your eating strategy first go organic look at your Macros look at your blood test look at your genetic test look at your omega-3 testing I didn't talk about omega-3 testing shweta it's a 2400 rupee pin trick test I can send a kid to everyone today for 2400 rupees you will come to know and I promise you this if your omega-3 level is low which it will be I'm not going to do the thing we're going to give you back money guarantee because some of you may be taking omega-3 supplements but your brain is made up of 50 60 fat and 50 of the fat is Omega-3 so when people start losing memory start going slower uh there was a study on Boston marathon runners phospholidylcholine which is a phospholipid which makes up 12.5 percent of the brain 40 percent of it dropped after the Boston Marathon guess what you train in the run-up right so why do people get mentally dead a month into the marathon they're not able to hold their jobs well think well see clearly maybe you're young you can do it but you need to top up your phosphorylserine you need to top up your omega-3 now the only way I would do this is if I did a blood test I know I can go on and on and on let's take up maybe four or five more questions and we'll wind up by 11 15. okay there was a question on intermittent fasting and somebody asked how much alcohol interfere training do we need to stop alcohol a little bit is okay so let's address intermittent fasting because I think that's a common question that comes up in a lot of our sessions if you have more than 50 body fat percentage is a man and more than 20 body fat as a woman intermittent fasting will work for you if you don't get acidity please go ahead fasting why our ancestors in spirituality on Monday Thursdays Lenten Christianity um you know Ramadan in in Islam these are all great things unfortunately religion has become very um uh fashionable today and we tend to do what is required and then we don't do the fasting part so please do fasting intermittent fasting is a nice marketing term that people like me have brought to the table so that we give a certain Flair to it everyone used to eat at seven o'clock in the evening and then eat the next meal at seven o'clock in the morning it's a 12 hour fast if you can go from 12 to 14 to 16 to 18 to 24 it works I'll share a secret to this group for all of you listening and so far research has shown that if you fast for 30 hours twice a month you can activate mitochondrial biosynthesis which means you kill out all the old mitochondria shwetan may have done this experiment where we do fasted State training for twice a week just to kill out the old mitochondria mitochondria the PowerHouse in every cell so most of us have about three four hundred mitochondria per cell Elite Runners uh younger ages have 1200 mitochondria per cell so that's how they generate power and endurance so in your 6 200 300 to 600 you will have some old guys also in there because your nutrition is bad whatever so you want to get it good fasting will throw out the sluggish ones and recreate the new guys now when the new guys come in and nutrition is good your nutrition supplementation could be bang on your endurance ability goes up because of uh intermittent fasting men should train in fasted State women ideally should train in a Fed State this has been my realization but there are few women for example with your permission can I tell them that you train and yeah so she trains in a fasted State and it works for her she loves it but there are many women I I have to give them a banana I have to give them an old an oatmeal or just some chia seeds or a dry fruit laddu or something first thing in the morning before they add out on a run but men um most of us Evolution and wise were built to go days and days without food to hunt the food so uh just imagine yourself as a hunter going out at five o'clock in the morning in gurgaon mist and uh hunt uh hunt whatever you're hunting and come back to us later should you eat after the run ideally speaking yes okay uh alcohol alcohol this is a tough one being a go on uh let me answer this as a scientist research now is showing uh Google up a guy called Dr Daniel Amen I actually had the privilege of making friends with one of his assistant his name is Dr Shane I'm actually reading his book right now uh Peak sleep performance by Dr Shane criado he works with Dr Daniel Eamon and Dr Danny Lehman does spect scans of the brain and Al in he has pictures which actually show the uh Hollow things in the brain and stuff like that with marijuana with alcohol with everything no I don't drink that punch I just drink on the weekend it is affecting but at the same time I would love to have a drink once a week I do have a drink once a week I now tell my clients go from large to small if you did four large downgrade to four Smalls if you did two large downgrade to two smalls if you've done heavy weight training on Friday so today Saturday is my weight training session I'm going to be doing legs today so today I will not be drinking because when alcohol remains in my bloodstream for 24 hours so I'm going to drink today um at around 10 o'clock at night uh but I'm going to do my weight training like session at five o'clock so at five o'clock I'm going to release creatine kinase for the next 24 to 36 hours to re-heal my muscle now if alcohol is in my system it goes and gives thapar to creatine kindness creatine cancer sorry so ideally if you want to be drinking you do not want to be drinking on the weekend when you do your heavy and long runs from an Olympic athletic performance point of view and if it can uh if it can help it if it can help you recover faster then no alcohol in your system works speaking of alcohol try and do the alcohols which where you dilute it it doesn't have more calories like orange juice or Coke you want to do more of soda water and and tonic water because those are the alcohols which will then not get the additional burden or calories should you eat and then drink alcohol highly recommend it so you you lie in your stomach and it doesn't get sanitized with the alcohol that goes into you and and this is this is not this is my question actually is that drinking post run because a lot of people say oh now I've done my Marathon TV and let's let's have their sure that there are two types of runners okay there are Runners who are serious and then our Runners are having fun and and as a sports nutritionist I cater to both audiences if you're a fun loving person go ahead and drink I mean it's not the end of the world it's not like you're going to get a catastrophic heart attack after that but know this that if another marathon is coming up four weeks later you would not do that because there's catastrophic damage in your muscle and it's going to take like about a week for it to heal back and immediately there is a window of rebuilding which is the first three days after what we call as microscopic trauma and in the case of marathon running is called microscopic trauma it's macroscopic trauma it's like somebody's taken a latte and beaten the life out of your glutes your hams your quads and your calves not to mention the cartilage and the ligaments and tendons in in the lower part of your posterior chain which is the legs so I would do a celebratory glass of wine or whiskey but I I've seen people go berserk after that and I think it's only slowing down your recovery I did have one very funny uh uh Punjabi gentleman uh another punjabis live life king size and he was like Ryan yeah protein Shaker patiala Peg and he would do both and I think that was the balance of the Two Worlds being fun and being performance and everything I do not endorse alcohol drinking Post Run but if you're a fun person and you're fun loving person uh we'll figure out how to balance your alcohol and your your supplementations I'll just show that there was a question Just One Last Question Ryan about can women start running after 50. why not is my question so I this is the advice I would give somebody came fresh to me number one is I would get them in touch with a great uh exercise physiotherapist to do an assessment of her body range of motion and all and then not start running immediately but first build three months of structured training uh cardio walking get all the joints moving get the diet in place because she might at that point have 10 15 more body fat which is dead weight on her next counseling so that's my secretary reminding me to move on so uh uh where was I yeah so the ladies come in and she gets all of this done get the diet in place look at the micro nutrition and all and then she should get a great running coach to come in and then build that thing now she just suddenly decides to run five kilometers and first it doesn't work and if you've seen a professional running coach they're like are you going crazy you just are going to ask me to walk for the first two weeks but that's the right thing that a person should do um and as a nutritionist though it's not my domain as an exercise physiologist I would highly recommend women after the age of 50 to weight train you have to wait train because you need to retain your muscle even men muscle is the only age reversible organ in the human body I repeat muscle is the only age reversible organ running doesn't build muscle running box on the cardiovascular endurance because it's body weight but if you want to get better bone density better testosterone lesser fat Mass both male and female after the age of 50 I would not buy that Mercedes-Benz where the Emi is one lakh rupees I would buy a skoda superb where the Emi is 45 000 rupees I would take out that 45 000 rupee Emi and give it to a strength trainer a Pilates trainer and a yoga instructor and I would do classes with them every month because your body is the Mercedes-Benz is the Rolls-Royce so please invest in an amazing qualified not housekeeping trainer most of the gyms in this part of the world the housekeeper after six months becomes a trainer in the gym finding the person don't be afraid to ask the certification from the trainer what did you do where did you study oh yours is a certification see who all the persons training is there a certain science is there a certain logic and if you have any doubts get in touch with me I know all the best trainers in the country I hope I answer your question absolutely perfectly so I just want to add this you know importance of having a strength trainer or a running coach even if you're just a simple maintenance Runner like me no like I just retired Ryan and no people are surprised that you have retired have consciously chosen not to do anything for some time that you know I pay 12K for my strength right now for 12 classes a month and I have a running coach who also charges a certain fees people do I will press that I am retired but I still have a one-to-one personal trainer I mean I would rather not vacation and go I really don't do any fancy parties Vacations so I think people are not realizing it that you know you need to save to be able to spend on these things so I really value what uh Ryan is reinforcing that having a qualified strength trainer they just see a lot of videos and start doing and that's when I think they get a backache or they get this and the extremas they're not doing anything Rama what was your profession before you retired I was in the tech industry you were the tech industry all of us dabble in stocks and shares right we think they're very good investors when you get a professional financial advisor you realize your money grows much better most people are like that they will try and do the workouts on their own thinking that they can manage their money sorry manage their body better but what you have to say Rama and and it's amazing that you know pointed this out you will compound the investment of what you invest in the trainer not today but when you're 90 years of age you will walk up the stairs and when you board a flight in India you will be the only 90 year old who doesn't ask for a wheelchair now that Madam no money can buy and as MasterCard says that is priceless okay Ryan uh I know there are more there will be more questions this is never ending one session one hour with you is never enough uh for the others if there are more questions we'll we'll either gather the questions and try and get a response for that I know maybe get back Ryan Ryan will be kind enough maybe to come back again for another session I'm happy too I'm happy to work with any people over here who have organizations and they want a speaker at the organization and stuff like that um it's it's my give back to society uh in terms of I've become very successful and and happy to do this with like-minded people uh because you become the brand ambassadors of nutrition you become the brand ambassadors of running you become the brand ambassador training and if if each one of you here can influence one lakh people around you we're a 1.3 billion population each one of you can become a health coach think about it I'm gonna say bye I'm going to say bye to everybody for attending so much Ryan thank you so so much really means a lot thanks bye-bye for whoever is still here we'll meet in two weeks thank you very much thank you thanks guys organizing this yeah I'll send the recording out thank you so much good weekend everyone bye likewise likewise thanks so much
