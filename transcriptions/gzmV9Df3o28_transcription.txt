[9.84 - 13.48] introducing to you my senior most
[12.00 - 16.12] nutritionist who's going to talk about
[13.48 - 19.32] the onam sadya but before we get started
[16.12 - 21.28] so aski what's onam to you onam Ryan is
[19.32 - 23.52] one Festival which is not as for
[21.28 - 25.88] religion but it's one Festival where all
[23.52 - 28.40] the people in Kerala come together to
[25.88 - 30.36] welcome King mahabali on his 10 days
[28.40 - 32.92] back from his Heavenly aboard and the
[30.36 - 35.44] people come together to celebrate not
[32.92 - 37.72] just with flowers and boat races but
[35.44 - 40.08] it's also the time of harvest where
[37.72 - 41.60] people thank nature for its abundance
[40.08 - 43.64] that they get to share with their loved
[41.60 - 46.60] ones and my mouth is watering because
[43.64 - 49.00] the star of the show is the onam sadya a
[46.60 - 51.80] feast Fit For A King so sasi let's go
[49.00 - 54.80] and get some EA
[51.80 - 57.76] absolutely so SAS today let's talk about
[54.80 - 60.24] the star of today's show the onam sadya
[57.76 - 64.00] and now this is a feast for a king it's
[60.24 - 66.16] really massive and it's the Banana Leaf
[64.00 - 68.24] so that's the highlights so Banana Leaf
[66.16 - 70.84] back in the day you would have it behind
[68.24 - 73.32] everybody's house and beyond that if you
[70.84 - 76.04] look at it scientifically Banana Leaf
[73.32 - 78.72] has its antioxidants and polyphenols and
[76.04 - 81.36] the moment you put hot food on it you
[78.72 - 83.56] get those benefits of it with the food
[81.36 - 86.44] that you're eating so right from there
[83.56 - 88.44] is where this entire sadya is such a
[86.44 - 90.20] nourishing meal and it's so amazing you
[88.44 - 92.60] know when you look at people pouring in
[90.20 - 95.28] water on it and then cleaning it I
[92.60 - 97.88] genuinely believe that the water is the
[95.28 - 99.88] bridge between the banana leaves
[97.88 - 102.00] polyphenols and the hot food that's
[99.88 - 105.24] touching it and somehow the nutrition
[102.00 - 107.28] comes into your plate absolutely yes so
[105.24 - 109.60] to begin with we always add a little bit
[107.28 - 112.32] of salt in the corner of the plate cuz
[109.60 - 115.28] salt represents in a lot of cultures
[112.32 - 117.92] Purity and so we always begin with a
[115.28 - 120.08] little bit of salt on the side also salt
[117.92 - 122.92] for us is sodium chloride as
[120.08 - 125.60] nutritionist and we know that the human
[122.92 - 128.32] body requires salt to survive and I
[125.60 - 130.60] guess when you serving A Feast for a
[128.32 - 132.28] king and it has 25 dishes in it you need
[130.60 - 134.79] a little bit of salt for flavor
[132.28 - 145.56] absolutely
[134.79 - 149.52] [Music]
[145.56 - 151.72] yes almost everything on the leaf that
[149.52 - 152.92] you see tea is full of nutrition so for
[151.72 - 155.04] a little bit of salt you've got the
[152.92 - 156.12] fried banana chips the same you've got a
[155.04 - 159.72] little bit of sweet this is called
[156.12 - 162.20] Sakari which has same banana but coated
[159.72 - 164.40] with jaggery you've got all of these
[162.20 - 166.88] different pickles which of course add to
[164.40 - 169.52] the Natural probiotic you've got the in
[166.88 - 173.36] Pulley which personally is my favorite
[169.52 - 176.08] that's Ginger and Tamarind with some
[173.36 - 178.36] spices and that acts as an amazing
[176.08 - 180.92] brilliant digestive a at the end of the
[178.36 - 183.44] Sumptuous meal now for the vegetables
[180.92 - 185.76] that are different one this is the AIL
[183.44 - 187.72] my favorite again so the AIL has
[185.76 - 191.40] different vegetables you can add many
[187.72 - 193.80] it's with coconut yogurt and some green
[191.40 - 196.28] chili so there's your coconut to give
[193.80 - 198.56] you the fat the yogurt to give you the
[196.28 - 199.80] probiotic then you've got your Thorin so
[198.56 - 202.44] Thorin can be made with different
[199.80 - 205.00] vegetables beans cabbage it has a little
[202.44 - 208.12] bit of dash of coconut with spices this
[205.00 - 210.88] is a CA curri which is usually a starchy
[208.12 - 213.28] vegetable which is either a raw banana
[210.88 - 214.52] or you can even take your yam it's mixed
[213.28 - 216.64] with black Chen so you've got your
[214.52 - 219.52] protein there and coconut of course and
[216.64 - 221.84] spices you've got the pineapple Pachi
[219.52 - 224.04] which is Yum so the pineapple p is
[221.84 - 225.92] pineapple with a yogurt base and spices
[224.04 - 229.28] again so amazing flavor bomb in your
[225.92 - 232.08] mouth this is your Olan the ol's a mix
[229.28 - 234.20] of a Ci or a lentil of sauce and it's
[232.08 - 237.08] got yogurt again as a base this is a
[234.20 - 238.88] little Bland so while all flavors add
[237.08 - 241.00] this is a bland part of it you've got
[238.88 - 243.32] your beetroot p over here and here is
[241.00 - 247.48] your morry this is like a g vegetable
[243.32 - 250.08] with yogurt base again rice with ghee
[247.48 - 252.32] Dal now you've got your sambar which is
[250.08 - 254.92] a lentil curry with vegetables your
[252.32 - 256.88] Rasam which is a Tamarind diluted
[254.92 - 259.64] Tamarind with spices and simmered for a
[256.88 - 261.96] long time and of course before we get to
[259.64 - 263.68] the sweets we've got your papum which is
[261.96 - 266.48] again actually lentil this is made with
[263.68 - 268.88] your black gr flour so that's again
[266.48 - 271.24] balancing it out for you so you've got a
[268.88 - 274.48] different types of P P so one this is a
[271.24 - 276.44] Dal based pisum so this is perp pisum
[274.48 - 279.12] you've got your seia pisum which is your
[276.44 - 281.32] wory and this is quite the speciality
[279.12 - 283.68] it's called the ad praam and this is
[281.32 - 285.36] also a rice based and the thing is all
[283.68 - 288.24] of these are cooked with the coconut
[285.36 - 291.00] milk base of course to end it all you've
[288.24 - 293.60] got buttermilk which will make you feel
[291.00 - 296.76] like you've had a good meal and uh adds
[293.60 - 299.04] to the probiotic benefit mostly we end a
[296.76 - 300.88] meal also with a little banana which is
[299.04 - 303.84] like a little sweet towards the end and
[300.88 - 306.28] also a good digestive so if you look at
[303.84 - 308.84] the onam sadya it's filled with
[306.28 - 311.20] vegetables that is grown natively in
[308.84 - 314.52] Kerala with a lot of coconut coconut
[311.20 - 315.96] milk and all your spices and though our
[314.52 - 317.60] ancestors wouldn't have probably thought
[315.96 - 321.56] of the scientific part or maybe they did
[317.60 - 324.12] they were quite wise they have this
[321.56 - 325.88] entire what I call a nice party in your
[324.12 - 328.00] mouth cuz you've got sweet you've got
[325.88 - 330.24] Savory you've got the inie pulley this
[328.00 - 333.28] amazing little sourness at the end
[330.24 - 335.68] you've got crisps you've got everything
[333.28 - 337.84] and the whole thing about the onam sadya
[335.68 - 341.40] is just about eating its SM you know so
[337.84 - 343.76] as my mouth cannot stop watering as you
[341.40 - 345.84] were speaking now as a nutritionist and
[343.76 - 348.60] you are a dietitian you're giving me the
[345.84 - 350.92] stamp for approval what I believe is
[348.60 - 353.24] that we could be looking at maybe
[350.92 - 355.48] portion controlling the rice maybe not
[353.24 - 356.84] asking for a second or third serving
[355.48 - 359.44] because all of us are trying to control
[356.84 - 362.00] our waist lines today and you mentioned
[359.44 - 363.56] a few of the pickles that were there and
[362.00 - 366.04] I realized that the ginger and The
[363.56 - 368.24] Tamarind were digestives yes Ginger is a
[366.04 - 369.88] natural fat burner I love the fact that
[368.24 - 371.56] you said something was Bland there so
[369.88 - 374.24] people who can't stand a lot of spice
[371.56 - 376.88] like me it kind of washes your pallet
[374.24 - 379.24] and just overall it's really amazing I
[376.88 - 381.44] think a word of caution if I were to go
[379.24 - 383.48] back in time and sit down with King
[381.44 - 385.80] mahabali and say that hey you know what
[383.48 - 388.68] I'd like to be your nutritionist maybe I
[385.80 - 392.20] do potion control on the jaggery I do
[388.68 - 394.52] potion control on my ghee and my pams
[392.20 - 396.36] which are looking so tempting am I right
[394.52 - 397.96] are these made in coconut milk yes
[396.36 - 400.32] traditionally they're all made in cocon
[397.96 - 401.68] so for a vegan person like me that's
[400.32 - 404.84] like not going to create my nose
[401.68 - 407.48] blockage so I would say that after this
[404.84 - 409.52] I'd be ready to run a marathon hey guys
[407.48 - 412.44] here are my quick tips to enjoy this
[409.52 - 413.92] onam sadya now you should enjoy this
[412.44 - 416.68] meal people ask me about putting
[413.92 - 419.20] artificial sweeteners in the desserts in
[416.68 - 421.76] the onam sadya you do this once a year
[419.20 - 424.48] enjoy enjoy yourself portion control is
[421.76 - 427.40] my first tip to you I would add on that
[424.48 - 429.72] when I serve the onam sadya for myself I
[427.40 - 431.76] make sure I take the rice once split it
[429.72 - 434.64] into three for the Rasam the sambar the
[431.76 - 436.76] curry and enjoy it with the different
[434.64 - 438.84] vegetables and that way you actually
[436.76 - 440.36] don't end up feeling like you filled
[438.84 - 442.60] yourself too much you actually feel
[440.36 - 445.48] quite good at the end of it speaking of
[442.60 - 447.88] potion control from sasani I would take
[445.48 - 450.56] that doing the buttermilk before you
[447.88 - 452.40] start the meal helps to fill up your
[450.56 - 455.36] stomach it's a digestive tool with its
[452.40 - 457.28] spices but if you want to eat lesser I'd
[455.36 - 458.88] have two glasses of Buttermilk which
[457.28 - 460.76] will kind of crowd out your stomach
[458.88 - 463.08] space and cause you to serve a little
[460.76 - 464.48] bit lesser or eat a little bit lesser
[463.08 - 466.72] yes definitely that's something that can
[464.48 - 468.88] be done if people want to start with a
[466.72 - 471.24] little bit of portion my final tip to
[468.88 - 473.04] all of you is the pickles are delicious
[471.24 - 475.56] and sumptious but you could easily
[473.04 - 478.08] overdo pickles because of oils so keep
[475.56 - 480.52] it down to a teaspoon when you're eating
[478.08 - 482.20] and a final point is a lot of the
[480.52 - 485.64] jaggery that could be used as a high
[482.20 - 488.24] sugar content so post this onam sadya a
[485.64 - 491.00] non food tip go walking with your loved
[488.24 - 493.32] ones for a long walk and reminisce about
[491.00 - 495.72] the thankful gratitude that you have for
[493.32 - 498.56] a wonderful year that you had last year
[495.72 - 500.76] and a great year that's coming ahead so
[498.56 - 503.52] um I think we should go dancing for the
[500.76 - 506.84] boat face after this so let's dig in now
[503.52 - 506.84] yes absolutely
[509.72 - 524.22] oh
[511.68 - 524.22] [Music]
