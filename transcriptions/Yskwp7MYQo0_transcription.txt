[0.08 - 4.72] hey guys if you're not able to watch my
[2.28 - 7.00] long form content of podcast here are
[4.72 - 10.68] some short form clips for you to enjoy
[7.00 - 14.72] but you you pointed on a point which was
[10.68 - 16.52] how important that people want to burn
[14.72 - 20.88] fat
[16.52 - 22.76] and what are rishab Tang's five tips
[20.88 - 25.28] over the years that you have learned for
[22.76 - 27.72] fat loss yeah I will uh I keep getting
[25.28 - 30.80] this question so pretty much top of mine
[27.72 - 31.96] I just sum it up First Nutrition is the
[30.80 - 35.04] most important thing when you want to
[31.96 - 38.24] lose fat first thing is eat less food
[35.04 - 38.24] and we live in a society
[38.44 - 46.12] where uh second eat sufficient amount of
[42.72 - 48.08] protein I again spoke to quite a few
[46.12 - 50.56] people and I told them I'd like to help
[48.08 - 53.16] you with your goals just tell me what
[50.56 - 54.88] your day looks like uh what do you eat
[53.16 - 57.92] through the day what what you know what
[54.88 - 59.36] are your goals while people felt that
[57.92 - 62.40] they're eating a lot of protein they
[59.36 - 65.72] didn't have protein uh in their
[62.40 - 67.96] diet so I feel that there is a change
[65.72 - 69.52] that we can make and I'm not saying go
[67.96 - 72.24] overboard but they should eat sufficient
[69.52 - 75.00] amount of protein third lift weights
[72.24 - 76.64] three to five times a week go to the gym
[75.00 - 79.88] and challenge yourself you got to work
[76.64 - 82.60] hard at the gym fourth sleep actually
[79.88 - 84.44] I'll bring sleep on the top sleep is
[82.60 - 87.12] everything sleep bad sleep is going to
[84.44 - 90.36] disrupt your eating Behavior bad sleep
[87.12 - 93.04] is going to disturb your work out
[90.36 - 95.00] quality sleep and I've been through a
[93.04 - 97.88] very rough phase in my own life with
[95.00 - 100.04] respect to sleep but sleep then you have
[97.88 - 102.48] no business worrying about fat loss fix
[100.04 - 107.12] that first because otherwise nothing is
[102.48 - 110.96] happening and finally you got to uh make
[107.12 - 114.32] sure that you're getting off the couch
[110.96 - 117.20] so move a lot through the day when I was
[114.32 - 119.64] uh with you on my nutrition plan um I
[117.20 - 120.48] remember you told me to walk yeah
[119.64 - 122.80] because
[120.48 - 124.72] whil you looked very fit you had a
[122.80 - 126.88] little bit of a higher visceral fat and
[124.72 - 129.20] that could be your genetic correct you
[126.88 - 130.56] know as a Marv you get that genetic
[129.20 - 132.44] programming into you where fat
[130.56 - 134.64] deposition is higher you don't see it
[132.44 - 137.08] because you're pretty flat but when the
[134.64 - 138.84] wing scale went internal and so we
[137.08 - 140.48] realized that walking was the only thing
[138.84 - 144.28] that would help you out no I and I was
[140.48 - 148.20] honestly you change a lot in my uh
[144.28 - 150.64] eating pattern I've learned so much just
[148.20 - 152.52] being on a plan with you I learned so
[150.64 - 155.92] much about myself like the kind of food
[152.52 - 157.96] that just does not agree uh with my gut
[155.92 - 160.08] the the kind of food that probably
[157.96 - 162.04] disturbs my sleep so a lot of learning
[160.08 - 164.68] happened in that process so while I came
[162.04 - 166.80] to you uh I'm going off topic but uh
[164.68 - 168.20] since we've got gotten it while I came
[166.80 - 170.16] to you with the goal of I don't know if
[168.20 - 172.28] you remember now but my goal was like do
[170.16 - 174.20] better at sports improve exercise
[172.28 - 176.76] performance build a lot of muscle mass
[174.20 - 178.96] shred body fat and those things happened
[176.76 - 181.32] and I if I remember it right I dropped 4
[178.96 - 183.12] to 5% body body fat in the first month
[181.32 - 185.88] in the first four weeks of being on a
[183.12 - 188.88] plan with you all of that happened so
[185.88 - 191.12] when I came to you I used to get a
[188.88 - 193.68] little before that for a few years I
[191.12 - 196.48] used to keep getting uh a sore throat
[193.68 - 198.56] very often like pretty much twice a
[196.48 - 203.56] month or something like that and I went
[198.56 - 206.08] to doctors they gave me um anti- acidity
[203.56 - 208.08] pills and some other medication and
[206.08 - 209.44] someone told me that you may have guard
[208.08 - 210.64] we may have to operate it and things
[209.44 - 212.52] like that
[210.64 - 214.04] so in my mind I thought maybe I'll have
[212.52 - 215.64] to get it operated maybe I have some
[214.04 - 217.32] something going on which I don't know
[215.64 - 219.64] about but when I came to you with a
[217.32 - 221.80] different goal you fix my food all of
[219.64 - 224.28] that goals I achieved but what I
[221.80 - 225.40] achieved was I like for one one and a
[224.28 - 227.80] half two years after that I didn't get a
[225.40 - 229.92] sore throat uh and I realized that it
[227.80 - 233.96] was probably because of the acidity that
[229.92 - 236.04] was happening and with good food it just
[233.96 - 239.28] you know took care of the acidity and
[236.04 - 241.24] throat was so the the secret pill in all
[239.28 - 243.80] of that is is just a simple
[241.24 - 246.00] concept whilst you can have a fitness
[243.80 - 249.00] diet with the right amount of carbs and
[246.00 - 252.96] protein and fat most people don't do a
[249.00 - 255.40] little bit of a deep dive into what fat
[252.96 - 258.32] what protein what carb correct and the
[255.40 - 259.88] quantity and the timing exactly so once
[258.32 - 261.32] you start getting this aligned which is
[259.88 - 263.36] what you did you came in and you paid
[261.32 - 265.16] for a six-month plan and then you
[263.36 - 267.12] started aligning it and then you started
[265.16 - 270.24] preparing it so you already had the
[267.12 - 272.88] knowledge but probably the execute tion
[270.24 - 275.12] and the small filtrations of The Good
[272.88 - 277.80] the Bad and the Ugly did not happen and
[275.12 - 279.76] I think that's the basic part that most
[277.80 - 281.68] people in the fitness journey should
[279.76 - 284.16] subscribe to like you said no sleep is
[281.68 - 286.64] very important and one part to fix your
[284.16 - 289.28] sleep is not eating the wrong Foods um
[286.64 - 294.08] after 5:00 in the evening uh you can
[289.28 - 297.72] never uh outrun a bad diet and you can't
[294.08 - 300.84] um you know um out eat bad sleep exactly
[297.72 - 303.60] so these a lot of ful things that you
[300.84 - 307.68] have done and it changed your health so
[303.60 - 308.60] I think you evolve to a level where you
[307.68 - 312.68] are
[308.60 - 315.08] now I'm athletic I'm pushing my body the
[312.68 - 317.24] highest level of training let's go back
[315.08 - 318.08] to the ABC of nutrition which I think
[317.24 - 321.48] most
[318.08 - 324.16] people are trying to wing it and
[321.48 - 327.80] sometimes they're listening to uh a huge
[324.16 - 329.28] plora of advices yeah that's a problem
[327.80 - 331.04] just taking nutrition advice of the
[329.28 - 332.88] internet you know your mom and my mom
[331.04 - 335.48] are both nutritionist at the end of the
[332.88 - 337.52] day so you know everyone's a subject
[335.48 - 339.72] matter expert on that and So speaking
[337.52 - 341.92] about subject matter experts we'll come
[339.72 - 344.04] back to your profession which is Fitness
[341.92 - 346.52] what are the common mistakes that people
[344.04 - 347.96] make in Fitness when they start out I
[346.52 - 351.44] think the biggest mistake that people
[347.96 - 354.60] make is going too far too soon so people
[351.44 - 356.88] when they start fitness journey they
[354.60 - 358.12] would probably buy an annual membership
[356.88 - 361.64] and like I said they want to also
[358.12 - 361.64] achieve that goal fast
[373.12 - 378.80] and they will be out of the fitness
[376.20 - 382.32] journey is over for most people so going
[378.80 - 385.76] too far too soon is a big problem second
[382.32 - 387.88] people just want to and it is maybe
[385.76 - 389.64] because they see things on Instagram and
[387.88 - 391.64] they see things on YouTube people
[389.64 - 393.92] lifting heavy weight the thing is that
[391.64 - 397.32] they just want to start loading heavy
[393.92 - 399.20] weight and going ahead of the curve
[397.32 - 401.68] while the reality is if the train slow
[399.20 - 403.20] one step at a time they will get to that
[401.68 - 405.60] weight they will get to that Fitness
[403.20 - 408.28] level but they want to do it in that in
[405.60 - 411.60] that week immediate
[408.28 - 413.92] immediate fast food fast body fast
[411.60 - 416.40] workout yeah exactly and then comparing
[413.92 - 418.44] yourself with with other people either
[416.40 - 420.60] at the gym or on social media that's a
[418.44 - 422.00] big problem even I have this problem and
[420.60 - 423.48] I've never been able to take it out of
[422.00 - 425.80] me it's like I always compare myself to
[423.48 - 428.36] a younger kid or a guy's got like beefy
[425.80 - 431.40] muscle like why can't I have his muscles
[428.36 - 433.48] why can't I lift like him so you're
[431.40 - 435.04] saying don't compare yourself to
[433.48 - 437.68] somebody else yeah I'm just saying just
[435.04 - 439.64] look at yourself have your how do I do
[437.68 - 442.68] that like do I keep like a card okay
[439.64 - 445.76] last month I deadlifted 40 kgs then next
[442.68 - 448.80] month I do 45 kgs so that is one way of
[445.76 - 450.32] doing it that you keep a workout log and
[448.80 - 451.64] you know that you're overall workout
[450.32 - 453.64] volume is going up which means the
[451.64 - 455.56] amount of work that you've done has
[453.64 - 457.12] significantly increased over last month
[455.56 - 459.44] and it is going up month over month so
[457.12 - 460.96] you're doing great if you're doing that
[459.44 - 463.96] you will obviously build muscle so you
[460.96 - 466.00] can do your body composition check uh at
[463.96 - 467.80] a 4-we interval or 8 week interval
[466.00 - 469.88] whatever works for you but do that body
[467.80 - 472.64] composition check take your progress
[469.88 - 474.40] pictures because that is the truth if
[472.64 - 476.64] you see yourself in a mirror or on a
[474.40 - 478.36] camera and if you think yeah I've put on
[476.64 - 480.08] some muscle that's it it doesn't matter
[478.36 - 481.96] how other person looks like because it
[480.08 - 483.72] is you versus you you just have to make
[481.96 - 487.80] sure that you are getting better every
[483.72 - 491.16] day I love that statement you versus you
[487.80 - 493.88] brilliant so if somebody wanted to copy
[491.16 - 495.60] you you know you starting in the gym say
[493.88 - 497.00] a 14 year-old is listening in or 18
[495.60 - 498.32] years is listening in and they're
[497.00 - 501.08] starting from zero and they want to
[498.32 - 502.68] become like you quickly what would they
[501.08 - 505.60] need to do just focus on the
[502.68 - 509.88] fundamentals what are they things like
[505.60 - 513.40] your Mobility stability like I there's
[509.88 - 516.12] one phrase that I really love we do
[513.40 - 518.08] Mobility first because we didn't show up
[516.12 - 522.80] in the crib doing side
[518.08 - 524.32] planks ah you got my point yeah uh and
[522.80 - 526.16] as children Mobility comes very
[524.32 - 528.88] naturally to us right all those children
[526.16 - 530.16] they can uh put their uh toe in the
[528.88 - 532.52] mouth and all those things they can do
[530.16 - 534.12] right so Mobility is not a problem it's
[532.52 - 536.56] only over the years it becomes a problem
[534.12 - 539.00] for us so make sure that you restore
[536.56 - 541.80] that Mobility you make sure that you get
[539.00 - 544.36] that mind muscle Connection in place you
[541.80 - 545.56] teach your muscles how to fire and that
[544.36 - 546.68] happens through movement pattern
[545.56 - 548.24] training so there are basic movement
[546.68 - 549.88] patterns right you sitting on this chair
[548.24 - 552.00] and we'll get get up from it what is
[549.88 - 553.96] that that's a squat we just need to make
[552.00 - 556.36] sure that we are able to do those
[553.96 - 558.16] movements properly with the right
[556.36 - 559.64] muscles firing at the right time and
[558.16 - 561.32] then eventually we are able to do that
[559.64 - 564.32] with load on it and that load will keep
[561.32 - 566.04] going up that's the process or uh like
[564.32 - 569.04] squat is one pattern hinge is another
[566.04 - 571.52] pattern Push Pull uh carry all those
[569.04 - 573.44] things you know we need to just teach
[571.52 - 575.68] our body how to do those movement
[573.44 - 578.12] patterns properly so my advice would be
[575.68 - 581.08] to just take it slow focus on the
[578.12 - 584.68] fundamentals and don't look at exercise
[581.08 - 586.72] as just exercise uh while you exercise
[584.68 - 588.56] also focus on eating well while you
[586.72 - 591.48] focus on exercise and eating well focus
[588.56 - 593.56] on following a good sleep hygiene also
[591.48 - 597.16] focus on recovery very important part
[593.56 - 601.12] what's your recovery uh routine I kind
[597.16 - 604.00] of spend uh a lot of time on my recovery
[601.12 - 606.40] um and especially after having a child I
[604.00 - 607.92] just change my workout and I do workout
[606.40 - 609.64] a lot you would have seen on my
[607.92 - 612.76] Instagram right I'm kind of working out
[609.64 - 614.80] all the time um and which means that I'm
[612.76 - 616.64] spending a equal amount of time
[614.80 - 620.20] recovering doing things that are not
[616.64 - 622.36] there uh on my social media so uh when
[620.20 - 625.68] it comes to recovery the first thing is
[622.36 - 627.48] the best recovery tool is your sleep I
[625.68 - 628.96] mean no matter how much people tell you
[627.48 - 630.68] you know do that protocol do this
[628.96 - 632.32] protocol call if you're not sleeping
[630.68 - 634.24] well nothing's going to work so you
[632.32 - 636.80] figured it out you figured that out and
[634.24 - 638.52] that's why by 8:00 to 9:00 you're in
[636.80 - 641.16] that zone to get ready to sleep yeah I'm
[638.52 - 643.96] in I'm in the zone at 7 like I would
[641.16 - 645.92] keep screens away and so so so rishab at
[643.96 - 648.12] her party is not much fun right after
[645.92 - 651.36] 8:00 you won't see me at
[648.12 - 653.44] parties I remember for New Year's uh my
[651.36 - 654.64] entire family was over and I'm
[653.44 - 656.16] constantly looking at the clock for it
[654.64 - 658.48] to become 12:00 and the moment it hit
[656.16 - 660.64] 12:00 at 12:15 I was telling my whole
[658.48 - 663.16] family okay come on everyone get out go
[660.64 - 664.72] home I need to go to sleep you know
[663.16 - 667.28] because we were awake by 7:00 in the
[664.72 - 668.92] morning so I get this thing that you you
[667.28 - 670.68] sleep is a good recovery sleep is number
[668.92 - 674.12] one anything else in recovery yeah of
[670.68 - 677.68] course so after sleep it is what you eat
[674.12 - 680.76] if you're eating a good well balanced
[677.68 - 682.92] diet that is going to help you uh uh
[680.76 - 685.32] recover faster for your future workout
[682.92 - 687.04] sessions and third easy and light
[685.32 - 689.40] movements like things like foam rolling
[687.04 - 692.72] soft tissue work doing some good amount
[689.40 - 695.88] of Mobility work uh doing deep stretches
[692.72 - 697.96] or just doing low intensity cycling all
[695.88 - 701.12] these things of doing a yoga class for
[697.96 - 703.80] example these things really help uh in
[701.12 - 706.84] recovering faster once all these things
[703.80 - 708.92] are in place consider doing an ice path
[706.84 - 710.44] and you know all those protocols that
[708.92 - 712.40] are generally spoken about they will
[710.44 - 713.92] help for sure but that's probably the
[712.40 - 715.44] top of the pyramid the bottom of the
[713.92 - 718.96] pyramid is you know these three things
[715.44 - 721.60] that I spoke about yeah you know you did
[718.96 - 725.88] say somewhere that you had sleep
[721.60 - 727.36] problems and now you've overcome them um
[725.88 - 729.64] what do you did what did you do
[727.36 - 732.60] specifically if you can remember to
[729.64 - 736.04] transition from that stressful part
[732.60 - 739.24] lesser sleep hectic lifestyle into a
[736.04 - 743.32] more healthier lifestyle a deeper sleep
[739.24 - 745.88] yeah so um I had a very rough phase uh
[743.32 - 750.12] with sleep for like I wouldn't sleep for
[745.88 - 752.16] weeks together and it was tough it was
[750.12 - 754.64] hard I also in that but I kept hammering
[752.16 - 756.56] myself at the gym so in that process I
[754.64 - 758.40] ended up hurting my spine so I live with
[756.56 - 760.60] a structural spine injury and I live
[758.40 - 763.48] with a structural spine injury uh that's
[760.60 - 766.24] a part of my life but I feel it happened
[763.48 - 767.32] because of Pat sleep and lack of
[766.24 - 770.24] recovery
[767.32 - 774.88] therefore how I fixed my sleep is I just
[770.24 - 777.12] realized that its behaviors first that
[774.88 - 779.24] you fix your behaviors and your sleep
[777.12 - 782.08] automatically starts to get better and
[779.24 - 783.60] sleep is not just the night time your
[782.08 - 787.36] preparation to sleep actually starts in
[783.60 - 789.32] the morning so I started getting in I
[787.36 - 791.76] started a habit of meditation at that
[789.32 - 793.44] time and I started with very it's very
[791.76 - 795.52] hard for me to meditate to sit that
[793.44 - 798.16] still for like 10 minutes or 20 minutes
[795.52 - 799.36] but I pushed myself into it and I used
[798.16 - 801.64] to the first thing in the morning I used
[799.36 - 803.52] to meditate Under the Sun so that
[801.64 - 805.48] exposure to sunlight which I still do
[803.52 - 808.24] right now that's mandatory for me and my
[805.48 - 809.80] son we have to get that morning uh sun
[808.24 - 812.44] exposure and evening sun exposure also
[809.80 - 815.24] for him so I started meditating Under
[812.44 - 817.60] the Sun I think that played a really
[815.24 - 821.08] important role in just making sure that
[817.60 - 823.32] my day goes very nicely without much
[821.08 - 825.64] stress and everything I also second
[823.32 - 828.96] thing I did was an early dinner so I
[825.64 - 830.92] just uh uh finish my dinner off at uh I
[828.96 - 832.80] mean right now I'm doing at 6 6:30 but
[830.92 - 835.84] at that time early dinner was like 8:00
[832.80 - 838.68] p.m. uh for me so I started doing dinner
[835.84 - 841.24] slightly early compared to 10:30 11
[838.68 - 844.44] habit of feeding very late at that time
[841.24 - 846.48] that really helped uh and just overall
[844.44 - 849.52] working out
[846.48 - 851.04] um in the first part of the day was
[849.52 - 854.08] something that worked well for me I also
[851.04 - 856.36] limited C caffeine intake significantly
[854.08 - 859.64] I love my coffee I drink a lot of coffee
[856.36 - 862.44] right now but after 12 there's a full
[859.64 - 865.16] stop after 12 no coffee I remember when
[862.44 - 866.68] we were working together uh two things
[865.16 - 869.12] that I knew that were going to affect
[866.68 - 871.72] your sleep was caffeine and the branch
[869.12 - 875.36] chain Amin acids yes and a lot of
[871.72 - 878.48] workout Executives uh will take a
[875.36 - 880.88] preworkout caffeine shot at 7:00 8:00 in
[878.48 - 883.20] the evening that you get a sleep but you
[880.88 - 885.48] get a very light sleep yeah so when you
[883.20 - 887.48] get up in the morning you don't feel
[885.48 - 891.04] fully rested because you didn't heit you
[887.48 - 892.52] didn't hit the Deep sine wave sleep and
[891.04 - 896.48] um I've had people who are even
[892.52 - 898.52] sensitive to uh BCA from way protein and
