[249.91 - 254.89] inspector of in infection he is the
[253.60 - 257.29] inspector of recovery
[254.89 - 259.57] I am food coming into the body I'm

[280.09 - 285.82] sir everything infection took why are
[282.76 - 287.38] you asking me so parents have to
[285.82 - 289.83] understand if your children fall sick
[287.38 - 294.31] very often there is a give and take
[289.83 - 297.58] between immunity and recovery and
[294.31 - 299.08] nutrition is like whom do I go do I go
[297.58 - 300.49] to recovery do I go to infection and
[299.08 - 302.77] obviously it will go for infection first
[300.49 - 305.71] so something as simple is not washing
[302.77 - 308.74] your face or skin or body of the sweat
[305.71 - 312.28] is reducing your recovery you heard it
[308.74 - 313.87] here first from Ryan Fernando so if you
[312.28 - 316.03] are smelling that's another thing nobody
[313.87 - 317.89] will come next to you but if you are
[316.03 - 321.49] getting a skin based infection it's
[317.89 - 325.03] because you're not being hygienic enough
[321.49 - 326.83] so please be good in your hygiene shave
[325.03 - 332.35] once a day maybe you shave if you've
[326.83 - 335.65] reached the age a huh poop once or
[332.35 - 335.98] twice a day you train how many times a
[335.65 - 340.69] day
[335.98 - 344.68] once or twice yeah twice can you train
[340.69 - 347.53] twice and its I study gym once if those
[344.68 - 353.05] of your older once a day how many times
[347.53 - 359.58] a day do you eat food even if you eat an
[353.05 - 362.35] apple a banana I call it one need eight
[359.58 - 365.13] eight to twelve is what the top-end
[362.35 - 369.16] athletes are doing let me tell you why
[365.13 - 372.48] if if these three boys you are going to
[369.16 - 376.57] school they will require an RD a
[372.48 - 379.90] recommended dietary allowance which will
[376.57 - 382.60] be 1,800 2,000 calories what were the
[379.90 - 384.70] height weight normally we calculated now
[382.60 - 387.34] they do three to four hours of training
[384.70 - 391.00] for our abdominal training is anywhere
[387.34 - 394.30] from 200 calories to find it calories so
[391.00 - 396.88] they are burning an additional 800 to
[394.30 - 398.62] 1500 calories a day which means all
[396.88 - 401.59] these three boys have to double the
[398.62 - 404.02] quantity of what they really require and
[401.59 - 406.78] this is where the mismatch between
[404.02 - 409.27] actual nutrition and actual of what
[406.78 - 413.68] happens because you are doing breakfast
[409.27 - 416.53] lunch and dinner like a mod me so sports
[413.68 - 419.20] nutrition is so so important for you to
[416.53 - 422.32] understand that it's forget winning the
[419.20 - 424.48] Medal you have to grow first anybody
[422.32 - 426.90] over the age of 17 over here in terms of
[424.48 - 431.50] the players know so you're still growing
[426.90 - 433.48] how old are you 18 so about 80 you
[431.50 - 435.10] stopped growing in boys in girls stop
[433.48 - 437.68] growing around 16 so these children
[435.10 - 441.81] require most of the nutrition today for
[437.68 - 444.24] growth like you can I recently had in
[441.81 - 447.27] Andhra Pradesh well very senior person
[444.24 - 448.98] came up said mr. Fernando I will give
[447.27 - 453.84] you one crore rupees if you can make my
[448.98 - 456.60] son grow another six inches I'm super
[453.84 - 461.81] excited on the phone sir what is the age
[456.60 - 468.21] of your son 21 sir boss Tony Kalia
[461.81 - 471.84] the age for girls to grow is 8 to 12 for
[468.21 - 475.68] boys is 12 to 16 want me repeat again
[471.84 - 477.30] girls growth 8 to 12 so girls
[475.68 - 481.32] 8 to 12 we have to eat correctly
[477.30 - 483.33] correctly don't start a self most girls
[481.32 - 486.57] children have this problem made a figure
[483.33 - 488.91] Technica my hips have to become better
[486.57 - 491.43] my bums looking too big in the mirror I
[488.91 - 493.65] know I have kids who are this age will
[491.43 - 496.98] be shocked parents girls have image
[493.65 - 498.90] problem today so they stopped eating and
[496.98 - 501.21] then you playing for hours of government
[498.90 - 502.89] on the court they're losing away muscle
[501.21 - 505.47] so body is now saying I've lost all this
[502.89 - 507.02] muscle so now the food that is going
[505.47 - 508.95] everything is getting stored as fat
[507.02 - 512.22] because the girl has gone into
[508.95 - 513.81] starvation mode famine mode so when
[512.22 - 516.03] people come to me and I see higher fat
[513.81 - 518.61] percentages I'm like you are not eating

[524.88 - 529.26] with the girl kid with the boy kid it's
[527.79 - 533.07] very simple he forgets to open the
[529.26 - 535.02] different box simple okay everyone

[535.02 - 540.90] experience boss
[537.45 - 544.53] okay so do you understand the importance
[540.90 - 546.21] of this badminton players if you think
[544.53 - 548.34] the most expensive racket is going to
[546.21 - 551.04] make you I am saying the most expensive

[558.93 - 562.65] quantity of the deck or that pony or
