[245.40 - 248.80] these videos you will understand that
[247.32 - 250.52] hey this is something I could do now
[248.80 - 252.88] doctors and all say no you don't need to
[250.52 - 254.60] do it the traditional system of medicine
[252.88 - 257.28] was you break down and then you go to a
[254.60 - 259.92] doctor the current system is I want to
[257.28 - 261.72] be aware of what could be probable
[259.92 - 265.00] hurdles in my life because of my
[261.72 - 266.44] genetics because of my lifestyle so just
[265.00 - 270.44] want to come to you wherein they're
[266.44 - 272.20] giving me uh an input and screen
[270.44 - 274.08] which is giving a comprehensive look at
[272.20 - 276.84] common lifestyle diseases and Cancers so
[274.08 - 278.92] when I looked at the the protocol card I
[276.84 - 280.76] was really really U impressed that oh
[278.92 - 283.56] you're going to give me a report on all
[280.76 - 286.40] of this okay and what got my eye for
[283.56 - 288.40] this one was the heart calcium score now
[286.40 - 291.80] it is like saying it is the gold
[288.40 - 294.24] standard of trying to check for blocks
[291.80 - 297.12] in your heart and I've never done it in
[294.24 - 299.08] my life and I did it and uh I want to
[297.12 - 301.12] share my reports with you I guess you
[299.08 - 302.88] know the result result from my smile
[301.12 - 306.20] because I was really worried you know a
[302.88 - 307.64] few of my clients have had heart attacks
[306.20 - 311.28] um you know we have had some leading
[307.64 - 313.80] film stars and actors you know postco um
[311.28 - 315.72] we don't know whether the virus the
[313.80 - 318.76] covid virus the vaccination has an
[315.72 - 320.20] impact on the plaque formation heart and
[318.76 - 322.44] people are just falling down because
[320.20 - 324.12] maybe they're working out too hard and
[322.44 - 325.68] you know they get heart attack so are
[324.12 - 327.32] you a person who goes to the gym do you
[325.68 - 330.08] work out really hard what is it that
[327.32 - 332.56] you're doing so can I help you in terms
[330.08 - 334.60] of diagnosing that so so basically we
[332.56 - 337.24] did the whole we did the whole checkup
[334.60 - 341.16] over here and we got the lipid profile
[337.24 - 343.20] blood test done and and in 2022 if
[341.16 - 345.52] you're watching this many years later uh
[343.20 - 347.60] the test in Bangalore is 15,000 rupees
[345.52 - 351.24] in Mumbai and and I think Delhi is
[347.60 - 352.60] 18,000 rupees um so I thought it was
[351.24 - 354.68] great value for money because they gave
[352.60 - 356.72] me the dexas scan they gave me the bone
[354.68 - 359.52] bindle density they did the heart CT
[356.72 - 362.68] score and they did an analysis of a low
[359.52 - 364.72] density radiation CD of my entire organs
[362.68 - 367.44] so that was something to uh really you
[364.72 - 369.88] know write home about so let me go with
[367.44 - 373.80] the first let me go with the first one
[369.88 - 376.56] which is my U you know my uh body weight
[373.80 - 378.52] and uh I was very excited to know that
[376.56 - 381.40] my lean mass was
[378.52 - 384.96] 67% and my fat percentage was a little
[381.40 - 387.92] higher than I expected around 28.5% now
[384.96 - 392.52] my scale here in the clinic shows a a a
[387.92 - 395.16] nice 14% body fat but the dexas is a
[392.52 - 397.80] gold standard you know and what I
[395.16 - 399.88] learned from this was um the doctor
[397.80 - 402.00] talked to me about how the Japanese
[399.88 - 405.08] focus on the visceral fat which is the
[402.00 - 408.00] fat you know near the organs and so the
[405.08 - 411.16] fat near the organs so I'm kind of
[408.00 - 413.60] getting a little bit of a tummy over
[411.16 - 417.24] here so I can actually pinch it now at
[413.60 - 419.24] this age right so at at 47 I'm like I
[417.24 - 420.96] don't want this right but I'm working on
[419.24 - 423.56] but but this is subcutaneous of what I
[420.96 - 426.60] can pitch but what this is showing in
[423.56 - 430.20] over here if you go in and see over here
[426.60 - 432.32] is um you can see the visceral fat okay
[430.20 - 434.64] and what she said to me Dr latia said to
[432.32 - 437.20] me was the end doctor she said see Ryan
[434.64 - 439.36] you got a in almost everything which is
[437.20 - 441.44] amazing except for my blood pressure
[439.36 - 443.88] which was a b so I got to be more
[441.44 - 446.64] de-stressed and have less salt in my
[443.88 - 448.08] diet uh but over here the visceral fat
[446.64 - 450.28] in the Japanese they say you should be
[448.08 - 452.84] below 100 so she just start working on
[450.28 - 455.00] your core start doing stuff on that now
[452.84 - 457.36] if you don't have this knowledge the
[455.00 - 460.00] assumption is oh I feel fit I look fit I
[457.36 - 461.36] good yeah everything blue blue blah blah
[460.00 - 463.00] but the visal fat is going to contribute
[461.36 - 465.64] too much towards my cholesterol tomorrow
[463.00 - 468.52] towards my block and stuff like that so
[465.64 - 471.00] that's very very important for you to
[468.52 - 472.56] understand you know that you can you can
[471.00 - 474.48] uh do it from this
[472.56 - 476.92] perspective uh the other things that we
[474.48 - 479.64] looked at was bone mineral density so if
[476.92 - 481.92] you you know this green part over here
[479.64 - 484.12] is they check the bone density with the
[481.92 - 487.52] CT scan and you'll be surprised that
[484.12 - 489.44] women after the age of 50 this really uh
[487.52 - 491.92] sorry women after the age of 30 because
[489.44 - 494.64] of maybe earlier menopause this starts
[491.92 - 497.12] dropping so broken bones come earlier in
[494.64 - 499.72] women issues with uh
[497.12 - 502.84] osteoarthritis osteopenia bone mineral
[499.72 - 505.56] density all of these exist so if you
[502.84 - 506.96] know this the next question you ask is
[505.56 - 509.00] how can I change my diet how can I
[506.96 - 511.28] change my exercise so women above the
[509.00 - 513.52] age 30 men above the age of 50 you've
[511.28 - 515.32] got to do this and this is why I went
[513.52 - 518.08] for this test okay so this was a heart
[515.32 - 519.96] scan to check your calcium CT score and
[518.08 - 521.88] when I got the result the first question
[519.96 - 524.52] I asked Dr latia was
[521.88 - 526.52] hey there's no plock present and you
[524.52 - 528.96] have less than 5% chance of heart
[526.52 - 531.28] disease so probably somebody stresses at
[528.96 - 533.48] me out I might get a heart attack but
[531.28 - 535.00] fingers crossed I can now run on the
[533.48 - 536.96] treadmill I can work out a little bit
[535.00 - 538.36] more intense without always looking at
[536.96 - 541.20] my garment and say oh my heart rate's
[538.36 - 542.76] gone up to 17 22 right and you know you
[541.20 - 545.20] have the niggle when you get it off and
[542.76 - 547.32] everyone's making fun about VAT Koh
[545.20 - 550.12] touching his chest guys he's an elite
[547.32 - 551.92] athlete man he just rubbed his chest in
[550.12 - 553.60] like okay you know you do it at as a
[551.92 - 555.16] reflex you're doing a power breath over
[553.60 - 557.20] there he's taking deep breath so he can
[555.16 - 558.72] recover quickly massage his heart tell
[557.20 - 560.08] his heart hey buddy I'm there with you
[558.72 - 562.12] and stuff like that and the whole media
[560.08 - 564.76] blows up thinking his heart is wrong
[562.12 - 566.96] what he would or should do is get a
[564.76 - 569.92] calcium CD score what you should do is
[566.96 - 572.00] get a calcium CD score so uh please get
[569.92 - 574.04] this done uh it is expensive as a
[572.00 - 576.92] standalone I understand it's anywhere
[574.04 - 578.56] from 8 to 12,000 rupees if you go and do
[576.92 - 580.32] only this test and if you do the Whole
[578.56 - 581.68] Health checkup and you have a doctor
[580.32 - 583.48] joining all the dots together it's
[581.68 - 586.40] really really amazing my lungs were
[583.48 - 589.08] amazing they did a CT scan of my lungs
[586.40 - 590.96] that was all good and you know the
[589.08 - 594.00] calcium scoring was all good the lungs
[590.96 - 595.72] was good my ECG was good my eye test was
[594.00 - 598.64] good let me go back to the original
[595.72 - 602.88] report okay so how the report came back
[598.64 - 606.68] to me was was um no abnormality
[602.88 - 608.60] detected and if you get a d you going to
[606.68 - 610.72] have to take the screening report and go
[608.60 - 612.76] and meet a concerned doctor in that
[610.72 - 615.96] department so whether it's in the heart
[612.76 - 619.84] in the lungs the colon the intestine or
[615.96 - 622.16] the kidneys or its BP or its diabetes
[619.84 - 623.56] then they give you a d so what I liked
[622.16 - 626.92] about this report is they've got the
[623.56 - 629.60] years over here 2022 23 24 and I have
[626.92 - 631.84] not I have not met any of the good
[629.60 - 634.00] diagnostic Labs keeping your records and
[631.84 - 635.76] giving it back to you what nura is
[634.00 - 638.24] promising and please do get in touch
[635.76 - 642.12] with me because I'll get you the I'll
[638.24 - 646.12] get you the guest uh pass I'll get you
[642.12 - 647.68] the um the bumped up the VIP you know if
[646.12 - 650.12] I was a DJ you would call me up for
[647.68 - 652.36] tickets to the nightclub I'm the DJ to a
[650.12 - 654.76] health checkup so if you do get in touch
[652.36 - 657.08] with me U me or my team will share the
[654.76 - 659.04] link here down I think it's below down
[657.08 - 660.76] somewhere here or up there but we sh
[659.04 - 663.80] share the link with you so if you're in
[660.76 - 665.84] Bombay um Delhi or Goram you can do the
[663.80 - 668.24] need for what I liked about it is I got
[665.84 - 670.80] A's and everything right so I was like
[668.24 - 673.20] yeah yeah I'm super good and everything
[670.80 - 675.20] but uh this requires work I work on my
[673.20 - 677.04] diet I work on my exercise I work on my
[675.20 - 679.40] sleep I got eight hours of sleep last
[677.04 - 682.00] night um I haven't been working out my
[679.40 - 684.04] in the last week because I hurt my knee
[682.00 - 685.60] um and the idea of doing a heal checkup
[684.04 - 687.28] was to kind of push my body and
[685.60 - 689.28] sometimes some of us are delicate
[687.28 - 692.04] Darlings I I don't claim to be any
[689.28 - 694.12] Sports person I claim to be only a good
[692.04 - 695.60] brain nutritionist talented nutritionist
[694.12 - 697.60] from here so this is good the brain's
[695.60 - 699.60] good but the rest of my body is just
[697.60 - 703.00] like anybody out there it's not at an
[699.60 - 705.20] Olympic level but this gives me
[703.00 - 706.52] reassurance that I've got good health so
[705.20 - 708.44] I got to work on my blood pressure so
[706.52 - 710.76] what I'm going to do I'm going to work
[708.44 - 712.68] on my pomegranate pomegranate um you
[710.76 - 714.68] know helps elasticity collagen helps
[712.68 - 716.56] elasticity of the blood vessels so my
[714.68 - 719.08] blood vessels are more elastic you know
[716.56 - 721.52] as they as my BP goes up my vessels
[719.08 - 723.64] should expand so it's getting like hard
[721.52 - 725.32] pipelines the calcium CD score is
[723.64 - 727.48] correct so I got to figure out that M
[725.32 - 729.92] may be stress driven maybe are taking on
[727.48 - 731.76] too many cases running the nutrition
[729.92 - 733.68] business or trying to fill my plate with
[731.76 - 735.48] too much of stuff maybe I need to relax
[733.68 - 737.20] more maybe I need to do deep meditation
[735.48 - 740.08] I need to do breathing so this is a
[737.20 - 741.92] department that I'm going to work on so
[740.08 - 744.28] um I'm I'm super happy with whatever I
[741.92 - 745.44] found out I want to work on my blood
[744.28 - 749.32] pressure and this is how the report
[745.44 - 751.04] looks okay so in 202 23 there looked at
[749.32 - 752.64] all my things my hemoglobin blah blah
[751.04 - 755.28] blah blah and they're given me an a over
[752.64 - 758.20] here so um everything's really really
[755.28 - 761.36] nice nothing to complain about my hb1c
[758.20 - 763.96] which is a indication of my glucose I
[761.36 - 766.20] was genuinely surprised because I did do
[763.96 - 769.36] it at another lab about two weeks ago
[766.20 - 771.80] and was 5.4 so again I'm going to
[769.36 - 773.68] average it out between 5.1 and 5.4 and
[771.80 - 776.72] and next week I'm going to be putting on
[773.68 - 779.04] a glucose batch a CGM device for the
[776.72 - 782.08] second time when I did it last year in
[779.04 - 783.40] December I remember um what my levels
[782.08 - 785.00] were and what my so I'm going to do it
[783.40 - 787.60] again this year and I'm doing this
[785.00 - 789.96] because I think of my my body is a rul
[787.60 - 791.44] stri and I'm I'm kind of like okay what
[789.96 - 793.32] can I do to make it better and the one
[791.44 - 795.48] thing that I learned from this report is
[793.32 - 798.56] I need to put on at least another 4 kgs
[795.48 - 800.72] of muscle mass and that I'm going to do
[798.56 - 802.24] between this year and next year's test
[800.72 - 804.76] so I'm you're going to see me trying to
[802.24 - 806.48] work a little harder in the gym uh maybe
[804.76 - 809.64] dedicate a little bit more time to
[806.48 - 811.72] Fitness uh and and and get um an
[809.64 - 814.12] insurance policy written for myself
[811.72 - 817.12] which is muscle is the only age
[814.12 - 819.96] reversible organ in the human body and
[817.12 - 822.64] so uh from head to toe taking care of
[819.96 - 825.40] your body is your own responsibility
[822.64 - 828.56] remember you can um you know you can
[825.40 - 830.52] take care of um everybody around you you

[841.36 - 849.84] spouse right you can't change the human
[844.88 - 851.36] body so I'm left with this guy in me
[849.84 - 853.68] what am I going to do about this guy so
[851.36 - 856.60] if you watched this video this far and
[853.68 - 859.32] I've kind of motivated you enlightened
[856.60 - 861.96] you given you some inputs I would be
[859.32 - 864.96] happy for you to come to Quan nutrition
[861.96 - 867.44] but after you get a b or a d or a
[864.96 - 870.16] c you get an A you don't need to come to
[867.44 - 872.60] con but by the way I just recruited one
[870.16 - 874.36] of the diti on my team onto my plan so I
[872.60 - 876.76] as Ryan Fernando work with the nutrition
[874.36 - 878.20] to make my diet plan because like it's
[876.76 - 879.84] like a heart doctor saying that he's got
[878.20 - 881.68] heart disease so he'll work on it
[879.84 - 884.08] himself now you go and work with another
[881.68 - 886.44] expert right so I'm going to work on my
[884.08 - 888.20] nutrition so if you want us to work with
[886.44 - 890.16] you on your nutrition get in touch with
[888.20 - 892.20] us at qua nutrition clinics we're a
[890.16 - 894.04] global clinic by the way if you do this
[892.20 - 896.04] test in your country anywhere in the
[894.04 - 899.00] world you just need to send me the
[896.04 - 901.92] report because the report gives us a
[899.00 - 904.60] crystal ball gazing into your future so
[901.92 - 907.28] we are literally like Health astrologers
[904.60 - 908.68] we can predict your future and and then
[907.28 - 910.92] what we do is we tell you to tie the
[908.68 - 913.20] string around your hand or you know when
[910.92 - 914.92] you get up in the morning uh turn your
[913.20 - 917.44] head in a certain direction and win at
[914.92 - 919.08] the sun no I'm just joking uh we can
[917.44 - 921.76] change the food that you
[919.08 - 923.60] eat so instead of putting on a ring
[921.76 - 927.20] that's going to give you an aura of
[923.60 - 929.32] energy let's figure out scientific stuff
[927.20 - 930.96] what you can put into your body
[929.32 - 932.84] how much of that you should put in your
[930.96 - 935.32] body and when you should put into your
[932.84 - 937.48] body like so how much when and what
[935.32 - 939.08] quantities and what timing of the day I
[937.48 - 943.16] think if you do all of this you'll get
[939.08 - 945.44] to the next level of um improving your
[943.16 - 948.88] health to the best possible level
[945.44 - 951.04] wherein you use food and your behavior
[948.88 - 953.36] as the absolute medication for the
[951.04 - 956.08] perfect God bless you my name is Ryan
[953.36 - 958.44] Fernando and if you like this video
[956.08 - 960.64] please share it with people around you
[958.44 - 963.92] uh who you are concerned about their
[960.64 - 966.68] health too better still watch it take
