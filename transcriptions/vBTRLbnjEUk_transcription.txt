[2.16 - 7.68] hey everyone i wanted to make uh a
[5.12 - 10.48] cardiac reversal
[7.68 - 12.48] tip for the year in 2022. so i've
[10.48 - 14.72] recently launched the cardiac
[12.48 - 17.20] rehabilitation diet division in koa
[14.72 - 19.92] nutrition my name is ryan fernando
[17.20 - 23.68] and i'm holding not a cricket ball
[19.92 - 26.00] but probably what is the most powerful
[23.68 - 27.76] most powerful
[26.00 - 30.24] fruit
[27.76 - 32.80] for heart disease and that's the
[30.24 - 34.72] pomegranate an apple a day does not keep
[32.80 - 37.04] the doctor away but i think a
[34.72 - 38.40] pomegranate is going to do it for you so
[37.04 - 40.80] i've been doing a little bit of research
[38.40 - 42.40] and i wanted to share my screen with you
[40.80 - 44.40] and it's going to be a little bit
[42.40 - 46.64] technical in a little bit long but those
[44.40 - 48.96] of you who come from a family history of
[46.64 - 52.08] heart attacks heart disease high
[48.96 - 54.00] cholesterol taking statins you might
[52.08 - 57.60] just want to listen to this for five
[54.00 - 60.08] minutes to convince you scientifically
[57.60 - 63.12] drug wise scientifically the proper
[60.08 - 66.80] scientific research paper on why
[63.12 - 68.40] this fruit is worth its weight in gold
[66.80 - 71.60] so let's get started i want to share my
[68.40 - 74.00] screen uh this is the study pomegranate
[71.60 - 76.24] for cardiovascular health if you want a
[74.00 - 78.72] copy of this study and you want to read
[76.24 - 81.04] it or show it to your cardiologist or
[78.72 - 82.88] your heart doctor then
[81.04 - 85.92] please ask me for it
[82.88 - 87.12] i digested it today and when digesting
[85.92 - 88.88] it today
[87.12 - 91.12] look at this okay
[88.88 - 92.80] 73 patients with at least one
[91.12 - 96.32] cardiovascular risk
[92.80 - 99.28] consumed pj pj's pomegranate juice
[96.32 - 101.44] 240 ml per day for one year
[99.28 - 105.20] and they show trends to increase
[101.44 - 108.08] arterial elasticity meaning if my blood
[105.20 - 111.20] vessels are a pipeline as i grow older
[108.08 - 113.04] my arteries become harder so they can't
[111.20 - 116.16] expand and take the blood pressure so if
[113.04 - 117.84] there is a blockage or a lesion it tends
[116.16 - 120.96] to burst or rupture over there so if
[117.84 - 123.76] it's flexible like a rubber hose lesser
[120.96 - 127.36] chances of ruptures so this is very very
[123.76 - 129.84] important on uh arterial elasticity i
[127.36 - 132.16] also give collagen i also give collagen
[129.84 - 135.52] for arterial elasticity but i did not
[132.16 - 139.04] know that pomegranate juice can improve
[135.52 - 140.96] arterial elasticity now what they did is
[139.04 - 142.72] they found people who had coronary heart
[140.96 - 145.52] disease and
[142.72 - 147.44] what they did is they investigated uh
[145.52 - 150.16] pomegranate juice consumption on
[147.44 - 151.52] patients with carotid artery stenosis
[150.16 - 153.28] meaning
[151.52 - 155.20] inside the pipeline there's all cut does
[153.28 - 157.60] and there's all bumps and everything and
[155.20 - 159.44] blockages and plaque and everything now
[157.60 - 162.08] 10 patients were supplemented with
[159.44 - 163.28] pomegranate juice for one year 10 guys
[162.08 - 167.44] 10 people
[163.28 - 170.24] and 9 people did not consume pomegranate
[167.44 - 172.96] blood samples were collected at 3 6 9
[170.24 - 175.92] and 12 months on the pomegranate juice
[172.96 - 178.24] and they measured the carrot intima
[175.92 - 179.92] media thickness cimt that's basically
[178.24 - 181.92] the thickness of the carroted artery
[179.92 - 184.08] which is here in the neck okay and they
[181.92 - 186.00] compared these 10 guys who took the
[184.08 - 187.28] pomegranate and the control group who
[186.00 - 189.84] did not take
[187.28 - 191.68] very interestingly in the control group
[189.84 - 194.56] meaning the people who did not take the
[191.68 - 197.44] pomegranate juice their cmt increased
[194.56 - 201.68] means the blockages the plaque formation
[197.44 - 204.32] increased went up by 10 percent but
[201.68 - 206.72] in the pomegranate juice there was up to
[204.32 - 208.48] a 35 percent
[206.72 - 210.56] reduction
[208.48 - 213.52] i was mind blown when i read the study
[210.56 - 216.40] i'm like why isn't the medical community
[213.52 - 218.08] not adding pomegranate
[216.40 - 220.48] to your diet
[218.08 - 223.36] now look at this pomegranate consumption
[220.48 - 227.36] revealed a gradual reduction of 13 in
[223.36 - 232.00] the first three months 22 26 and by the
[227.36 - 234.16] ninth month you went up to as high as 26
[232.00 - 235.92] to 35 percent so that was amazing okay
[234.16 - 237.04] so this is one thing fine you're not
[235.92 - 239.28] convinced that you should eat
[237.04 - 241.36] pomegranate let me go to the next part
[239.28 - 243.52] that they discovered one of the thing is
[241.36 - 246.08] a boss you have bad cholesterol ldl
[243.52 - 248.16] cholesterol when it gets oxidized matlab
[246.08 - 249.52] hey glucose come there fat food food
[248.16 - 250.80] start slapping cholesterol era
[249.52 - 252.40] cholesterol
[250.80 - 254.96] molecules
[252.40 - 254.96] sticky buns
[258.08 - 261.92] glucose gives one shot to the
[260.08 - 264.40] cholesterol this is called
[261.92 - 266.48] peroxidase oxidation so oxidation
[264.40 - 269.04] happens on the ldl the bad guy and it
[266.48 - 272.40] becomes sticky and we have found this in
[269.04 - 274.16] the angiographically documented
[272.40 - 276.72] scans where they find the plaques and
[274.16 - 279.04] everything so what they said over here
[276.72 - 281.44] was
[279.04 - 284.40] it was found that increased oxidative
[281.44 - 286.96] stress was observed in non-insulin type
[284.40 - 288.32] 2 diabetes so most people who have
[286.96 - 290.40] diabetes also are having high
[288.32 - 292.08] cholesterol but the diabetes are going
[290.40 - 293.76] and doing tap tube tube and doing all
[292.08 - 296.64] gundagiri to the cholesterol making it
[293.76 - 298.48] sticky increasing your atherosclerosis
[296.64 - 299.36] or plaque formation
[298.48 - 302.24] but
[299.36 - 303.68] on consumption of 50 ml of pomegranate
[302.24 - 306.96] juice per day for a period of three
[303.68 - 310.16] months there was a significant reduction
[306.96 - 312.40] in the basal serum thio barbutric acid
[310.16 - 314.24] relative substances
[312.40 - 316.80] the simplest way i can explain this to
[314.24 - 320.16] you is that this t bars
[316.80 - 324.64] is like a testing to measure
[320.16 - 327.68] the the oxidation of the cholesterol how
[324.64 - 330.64] bad is it okay and this tea bass test
[327.68 - 333.60] says with pomegranate juice your
[330.64 - 334.48] gunda giri slapping that is happening on
[333.60 - 337.44] the
[334.48 - 338.72] plaque is reducing by 28 percent what do
[337.44 - 340.80] you want to do in heart disease what do
[338.72 - 344.16] you want to do in diabetes we want to
[340.80 - 345.68] reduce the cholesterol plaque formation
[344.16 - 347.36] i just think pomegranate needs to be
[345.68 - 350.16] part of your diet hang on still not yet
[347.36 - 352.52] convinced let's go further further
[350.16 - 354.56] in carotid artery stenosis
[352.52 - 356.40] pomegranate consumption by these
[354.56 - 359.20] patients resulted in a significant
[356.40 - 363.20] reduction in the basal level of ldl
[359.20 - 367.76] associated lipid peroxidases by 43
[363.20 - 370.56] 89 86 and a whopping 90
[367.76 - 371.76] after 12 months
[370.56 - 372.96] you know i read this study and i was
[371.76 - 374.40] like i've got to share this with the
[372.96 - 375.76] world i mean even if the world doesn't
[374.40 - 378.00] want to watch this and even if you don't
[375.76 - 380.40] share it with anyone i don't care if i
[378.00 - 382.96] can save one person's life because they
[380.40 - 385.52] start eating pomegranates every day and
[382.96 - 387.68] take 240 ml of juice god bless you for
[385.52 - 388.40] listening into this video and i hope you
[387.68 - 390.24] live
[388.40 - 391.44] an extra decade because you start eating
[390.24 - 393.52] a pomegranate do you know what i am
[391.44 - 395.52] doing i'm searching to buy a pomegranate
[393.52 - 397.68] farm i think i want to buy a pomegranate
[395.52 - 399.52] farm if anyone has a pomegranate farm uh
[397.68 - 401.04] please message me i want to buy your
[399.52 - 402.96] pomegranate farm
[401.04 - 404.88] i think it's a food worth its weight in
[402.96 - 407.36] gold still not yet convinced hang on
[404.88 - 410.48] hang on a little bit more in this study
[407.36 - 413.44] okay uh where was that yeah
[410.48 - 416.96] in this carotid artery stenosis patients
[413.44 - 419.52] systolic bp was reduced by seven percent
[416.96 - 421.84] 11 10 and 12
[419.52 - 423.60] after 12 months so most bp patients most
[421.84 - 427.04] diabetic patients are taking bp
[423.60 - 429.76] medication well i mean ryan 10 is not
[427.04 - 432.56] enough but here's my thought process
[429.76 - 434.72] what if i could give you a food
[432.56 - 437.52] that lowers your bp so any of my clients
[434.72 - 439.84] who have a higher bp i would say let's
[437.52 - 440.64] add a pomegranate by the way when i had
[439.84 - 443.68] the
[440.64 - 445.60] continuous glucose monitor on my arm
[443.68 - 447.60] and tracking my sugar when i drank
[445.60 - 450.08] orange juice my sugar went up when i
[447.60 - 452.64] drank pomegranate juice my sugar went
[450.08 - 455.04] down now i'm not saying that we should
[452.64 - 456.64] blindly give pomegranate juice
[455.04 - 459.36] to people with diabetes but what you
[456.64 - 461.44] could do is take a pin prick and check
[459.36 - 464.00] after half an hour and after 90 60 and
[461.44 - 466.24] 90 minutes is the sugar in a patient
[464.00 - 468.16] who's given pomegranate juice maybe at
[466.24 - 470.64] around 11 o'clock between two meals or
[468.16 - 472.16] at four o'clock between two meals and if
[470.64 - 474.64] the sugar doesn't go up
[472.16 - 476.72] you can take pomegranate juice and
[474.64 - 479.84] that's the bio individual approach that
[476.72 - 483.04] i would give you final part of the whole
[479.84 - 485.12] study which is macrophages are basically
[483.04 - 489.12] improved triglyceride is improved and
[485.12 - 490.88] oxidized lipids accumulation all improve
[489.12 - 493.76] because of the consumption of
[490.88 - 495.36] pomegranate juice so
[493.76 - 497.20] what are you waiting for
[495.36 - 498.48] carotid lesions
[497.20 - 500.88] also
[498.48 - 502.88] contained less cholesterol which means
[500.88 - 504.24] those bumps had lesser sticky
[502.88 - 506.00] cholesterol in them because of the
[504.24 - 509.28] pomegranate and i remember the first one
[506.00 - 511.76] 35 reduction in black formation
[509.28 - 512.80] it is the drain x it is the drainage to
[511.76 - 513.68] clean up now
[512.80 - 515.76] don't
[513.68 - 518.16] make mistaken my uh
[515.76 - 519.36] my enthusiasm to go off your medication
[518.16 - 521.76] because there's one more thing i want to
[519.36 - 523.52] tell you they found out patience on
[521.76 - 525.52] statin which is the drug that doctor
[523.52 - 527.68] gives you please take your statins if
[525.52 - 529.20] your doctors give you it saves
[527.68 - 532.24] uh from
[529.20 - 534.56] incidences of clots blah blah blah blah
[532.24 - 537.04] there's a huge benefit in taking statins
[534.56 - 538.88] yes it does cause muscle fatigue it
[537.04 - 540.40] lowers your coenzyme q10 so your
[538.88 - 543.84] nutritionist should give you coenzyme
[540.40 - 546.32] q10 but they did this study with statins
[543.84 - 549.28] plus pomegranate juice
[546.32 - 551.76] and what they found out was mind-blowing
[549.28 - 554.64] for me when i read this which is uh
[551.76 - 557.52] there are these two guys okay uh puni
[554.64 - 559.12] seg glasin uh which is punishic acid
[557.52 - 561.36] which is found in the seeds so you got
[559.12 - 562.88] to eat the seeds okay grind the seeds
[561.36 - 564.08] and
[562.88 - 566.32] beta
[564.08 - 568.08] steetosterol now both of these are found
[566.32 - 570.72] in pomegranate and they combine it with
[568.08 - 573.04] the statin called simvastatin
[570.72 - 574.56] now what they found out was the
[573.04 - 577.04] reduction in the cholesterol
[574.56 - 580.00] biosynthesis rate was
[577.04 - 582.56] down reduced by 42 percent as compared
[580.00 - 584.56] to person only taking statin
[582.56 - 585.76] so that for me was very interesting that
[584.56 - 587.60] is
[585.76 - 589.76] my doctor would not have to be give me
[587.60 - 592.08] aggressive statin i would take the
[589.76 - 594.24] statin with the pomegranate get my
[592.08 - 596.56] cholesterol down and then as the months
[594.24 - 597.76] proceed if i'm an initial heart cardiac
[596.56 - 599.76] patient
[597.76 - 602.24] i'm cleaning up my arteries over one two
[599.76 - 605.12] years such that after two three years of
[602.24 - 607.76] consecutive no high homocysteine no high
[605.12 - 610.48] lipoprotein a lipoprotein b ldl is very
[607.76 - 612.96] good you can probably be weaned off your
[610.48 - 614.56] statin okay so
[612.96 - 616.80] i don't know what more do you require
[614.56 - 619.84] for me to consume synwastatin
[616.80 - 622.56] decreased macrophages reactive oxygen
[619.84 - 623.92] species formation by 11
[622.56 - 626.16] ros is
[623.92 - 628.64] uh the free radical damage that can
[626.16 - 631.20] happen at that area so it's almost
[628.64 - 635.28] saying like you're giving a spa to your
[631.20 - 636.88] blood from getting agitated around the
[635.28 - 638.88] cholesterol plaque
[636.88 - 642.16] uh
[638.88 - 644.56] significant inhibition was noted at 61
[642.16 - 646.48] to 79 percent now people would say oh
[644.56 - 648.40] there were only 10 people in the study
[646.48 - 650.88] or it was only five people was the
[648.40 - 652.80] pomegranate gourd was a pomegranate bad
[650.88 - 655.44] i'm a nutritionist
[652.80 - 657.76] i can't argue that medicines are not
[655.44 - 660.56] good and not have a scientific backing
[657.76 - 662.64] but when a paper is done on a
[660.56 - 664.24] pomegranate juice
[662.64 - 667.28] and it's out there
[664.24 - 669.20] scientifically documented my job is to
[667.28 - 670.32] get it to you so you can get it to your
[669.20 - 672.64] doctor
[670.32 - 675.92] and they may brush it off but if
[672.64 - 678.48] anybody's worth their weight in gold
[675.92 - 680.80] understands a scientific document and
[678.48 - 684.00] takes the time to read this
[680.80 - 685.60] they will start writing pomegranate as a
[684.00 - 688.00] prescription
[685.60 - 690.96] for heart health the cardiac division is
[688.00 - 693.12] now live at kwan nutrition it's been my
[690.96 - 696.64] lifelong mission to change the way
[693.12 - 697.92] everybody eats and i hope this one video
[696.64 - 700.32] makes you buy
[697.92 - 702.88] a pomegranate and not for one day for
[700.32 - 704.32] the next 365 days oh by the way i did
[702.88 - 705.84] the calculation
[704.32 - 708.24] so here in india
[705.84 - 711.12] i assumed 90 rupees for a pomegranate
[708.24 - 714.08] cost per day it's going to cost us 32
[711.12 - 718.64] 000 rupees per year the cost of one
[714.08 - 720.88] stent is 40 000 rupees not counting the
[718.64 - 723.68] admission fees doctors fees everything
[720.88 - 725.28] else and the pain and the suffering that
[723.68 - 727.20] you go through oh my god i'm going to
[725.28 - 729.52] get a heart attack i think if you want
[727.20 - 732.48] to live life till the age of 100
[729.52 - 735.12] buy a pomegranate eat one every day
[732.48 - 737.04] i hope to see you uh in person and if i
[735.12 - 739.44] ever meet you and this videos influ
[737.04 - 743.64] influenced you please gift me a
[739.44 - 743.64] pomegranate god bless you
[749.76 - 751.84] you
