Title: will fasting help you?

Description: We humans are eating too much We really need to monitor our eating habits to understand our body's wants and needs. In today's day and age, we have a lot of intellectual work to be done rather than extreme physical work (majority), so then our needs change. we need to address and adapt to these changes, especially nutritionally.

[0.20 - 3.68] fasting work for some people for some
[2.12 - 5.32] people it's intermediate and some people
[3.68 - 6.88] it doesn't work at all I believe no one
[5.32 - 8.96] siiz fits on but in the general
[6.88 - 10.44] consensus the human race is eating too
[8.96 - 12.48] much today so what I do is when a
[10.44 - 13.96] patient walks in or a client walks in I
[12.48 - 15.36] first teach them the portions that they
[13.96 - 17.08] need to eat then as they move through a
[15.36 - 19.28] 3mon plan with me and they get
[17.08 - 20.80] comfortable with understanding portion
[19.28 - 23.28] understanding timing then I move the
[20.80 - 25.08] timing into shorter Windows of eating so
[23.28 - 27.00] we go from a 12h hour eating window to
[25.08 - 28.40] an 8 hour to a 6 hour eating window so
[27.00 - 29.84] when you come down to a 6-hour eating
[28.40 - 31.44] window which could be probably 12 noon
[29.84 - 33.16] to 6: p.m. the rest of the time you're
[31.44 - 35.12] not eating which you technically don't
[33.16 - 37.56] need to eat because you and I are DJs
[35.12 - 41.08] desk jockeys right so we're using our
[37.56 - 41.08] fingers and we're using our brains
