Title: Order a Blood Test in India (Self Prescription)-Advice by Celebrity Nutritionist RYAN FERNANDO

Description: ORDER YOUR BLOOD TESTS HERE You can order my PREFERRED list for aligning your diet. Please click this link to register and pay for your blood tests. If you have doubts about what to order and how you want to proceed, you can always call my clinic on +919743430000 or www.quanutrition.com and book an appointment with a dietitian ( Free) to get a consult on what blood tests to ask for. If this video helps you or your family member, please make sure to mark it and share it. "Prevention is better than cure", "A stitch in time saves nine" are well-known adages. Today more emphasis is placed on preventing diseases and promoting health awareness. Growing sedentary lifestyles, increasing stress levels at the workplace, tempting and enticing food displays, growing disposable incomes, increased addictions to automobiles, all indicate that we give to our body more than what it needs. This has given rise to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a host of many other lifestyle disorders. With advanced tests and technologies, clinical laboratories can help in identifying various disorders accurately which can be treated completely, or at least the progress can be delayed. ORDER YOUR BLOOD TESTS HERE Instructions This test may be done fasting or 2-6 hours after eating. I suggest 10-12 hours is best. Both ways provide valuable information, though 2-6 hours after a meal provides a more realistic assessment of the state of your blood in everyday life. Stay hydrated and take your medications as prescribed. If you are supplementing with any hormones, we suggest taking them approximately 2 hours prior to having your blood drawn to see peak levels. Hormones are best drawn between 8-10 AM. Hormonal contraceptives can interfere with progesterone and estrogen results. Ideally, cortisol should be checked in the morning around 8 AM. Pre-menopausal women: For a 28 day cycle, blood should be drawn on day 21 (day 1 is the day that bleeding begins). For longer or shorter cycles, count 8 days back from the day your next menstruation would start. Post-menopausal women: Blood can be drawn any day of the month. Save tax upto Rs. 5000 under section 80D of Income tax act 1961 when you order a blood test. * A WORD OF CAUTION Sometimes the person testing you is delayed or cancels this is extremely frustrating. Please don't allow this to affect your blood pressure. Its only a blood test so relax and re-order. I cannot endorse or guarantee the level of service from THYROCARE. Its my intent to make easier and cheaper tests to the Indian public and I am doing this as a service to all.

[139.36 - 145.36] a good value for money in addition to
[142.00 - 148.88] the thyroid but better still is you can
[145.36 - 150.00] do this 140 test once a year
[148.88 - 151.52] and then you don't need to do it
[150.00 - 152.88] regularly if you don't have any issues
[151.52 - 155.20] and your hail and hearty so once a year
[152.88 - 157.20] do it look for your diabetic markers you

[157.20 - 161.20] want to be looking like hbo and c and
[159.52 - 162.88] all now if you do this blood test my
[161.20 - 164.64] nutritionist will go through it and tell
[162.88 - 166.64] you hey is there something wrong and oh
[164.64 - 168.40] you know h bunch is high maybe you could
[166.64 - 169.52] start having five grams of amla powder
[168.40 - 171.44] in the morning because that lowers
[169.52 - 174.24] cholesterol that improves glucose
[171.44 - 175.60] sensitivity cinnamon quarter teaspoon
[174.24 - 178.40] three times a day quarter quarter
[175.60 - 181.92] quarter improves um you know your sugar
[178.40 - 183.44] levels and then finally i want everybody
[181.92 - 186.00] at some point in their life to do the
[183.44 - 188.80] food intolerance panel which is where
[186.00 - 191.04] you find out which food is fighting in
[188.80 - 194.56] your body so if you look over here
[191.04 - 196.48] you've got 38 fishes nuts spices dairy
[194.56 - 199.12] so you've got different types of dairy
[196.48 - 200.56] that is over here when i did my food
[199.12 - 202.56] intolerance test
[200.56 - 205.44] it came back for wheat it came back for
[202.56 - 208.00] dairy i only can drink camel's milk
[205.44 - 210.56] which is very funny and i'm not supposed
[208.00 - 212.00] to have peanuts raspberries
[210.56 - 213.84] strawberries and stuff like that and i'm
[212.00 - 215.76] gonna have peanuts nothing happens to me
[213.84 - 217.92] but i've noticed the next morning i get
[215.76 - 218.80] up with a blocked nose
[217.92 - 222.32] so
[218.80 - 223.84] the idea is in 2022 and onwards let's
[222.32 - 226.00] discover the foods that you put into
[223.84 - 228.24] your body are they fighting with you
[226.00 - 230.32] please understand people once you cross
[228.24 - 232.08] 50 you get a lot of aches and pains in
[230.32 - 234.32] your body in your joints and stuff like
[232.08 - 238.40] that so i genuinely believe that
[234.32 - 241.68] everything from thyroid to pancreatitis
[238.40 - 244.64] uh to fatty liver to uh rheumatoid
[241.68 - 246.32] arthritis there's some inflammation this
[244.64 - 248.48] inflammation i believe is coming from
[246.32 - 250.88] the food chain so maybe you could do a
