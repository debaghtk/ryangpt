[291.12 - 296.04] closest to a person not prescribing you
[293.12 - 299.84] medicine but using food as your drug
[296.04 - 301.52] using exercise as a pill and using sleep
[299.84 - 302.84] as a soothing bomb to get you to the
[301.52 - 304.80] next level let's say I want to make you
[302.84 - 306.32] an office Olympian and the people in
[304.80 - 308.16] these pictures are all superstars my
[306.32 - 309.84] latest Superstar is anupam care I'm
[308.16 - 312.96] having a ball of a time dealing with
[309.84 - 315.36] this Kashmir Superstar giant of a of a
[312.96 - 319.48] Bollywood celebrity now many of you who
[315.36 - 321.92] are coming in today may say but they
[319.48 - 324.48] celebrities you are the celebrity of
[321.92 - 326.68] your life they become celebrities
[324.48 - 329.92] because they chose very early on in
[326.68 - 332.12] their life to become celebrities I never
[329.92 - 334.00] knew I would become a celebrity
[332.12 - 335.28] nutritionist I always thought I'd be a
[334.00 - 336.84] nutritionist but the day I said I'm
[335.28 - 339.52] going to become a celebrity nutritionist
[336.84 - 342.36] a decade ago I began taking care of two
[339.52 - 344.36] things the talent or the necessary
[342.36 - 346.36] subject matter expertise like you as a
[344.36 - 347.80] financial individual have to become good
[346.36 - 349.80] at your job at your financial
[347.80 - 351.24] capabilities people skills and the
[349.80 - 353.00] second part is how do you get good in
[351.24 - 357.04] your body so people follow you so if
[353.00 - 359.28] you're a 27 year old in 360 TF or if you
[357.04 - 361.88] a vendor or if you are a partner or if
[359.28 - 364.08] you are a client who consumes this
[361.88 - 366.44] financial data when you beat people you
[364.08 - 369.08] are the celebrity in that
[366.44 - 372.08] introduction so it's very important how
[369.08 - 374.84] you breathe how you talk how you hold
[372.08 - 377.80] your energy in the communication today
[374.84 - 380.24] so the first takeaway from this slide is
[377.80 - 383.56] I want you to see your picture in this
[380.24 - 385.32] slide you are the celebrity of your life
[383.56 - 386.60] you own the balance sheet of your life
[385.32 - 388.96] if you don't own the balance sheet of
[386.60 - 390.08] your life you will not know your trp
[388.96 - 391.52] rating
[390.08 - 393.84] and your trp rating is what I'm going to
[391.52 - 396.24] Define for you today
[393.84 - 397.96] so I'm going to talk to you about how we
[396.24 - 399.96] can do some simple things okay I'm not
[397.96 - 402.12] going to give you a diet plan I cannot
[399.96 - 403.92] give you a diet plan because in my
[402.12 - 405.52] clinic qua nutrition where I practice
[403.92 - 408.36] yeah this logo up over
[405.52 - 410.00] here we do custom nutrition planning
[408.36 - 412.08] meaning I take your blood test I take
[410.00 - 414.00] your genetic test I take your microbiome
[412.08 - 415.96] which is your stool or poop analysis I
[414.00 - 417.96] do a blood test for your omega-3 then I
[415.96 - 419.36] sit down with you for 1 hour and I ask
[417.96 - 420.76] you where do you work what is your cult
[419.36 - 421.92] culture what is your background which
[420.76 - 423.68] part of the world are you from where
[421.92 - 424.76] have you relocated to who's cooking food
[423.68 - 427.04] for you what are the timings of your
[424.76 - 429.00] office and then I construct a very
[427.04 - 430.44] personalized nutrition plan so people
[429.00 - 432.08] ask me should I drink coffee I don't
[430.44 - 434.20] know till you do your genetic test so
[432.08 - 435.88] when I did my genetic test I love
[434.20 - 437.60] drinking coffee I to drink five cups of
[435.88 - 439.64] coffee a day and then I found out my
[437.60 - 441.52] body my genetics does not like coffee in
[439.64 - 443.04] fact drinking five cups of coffee will
[441.52 - 444.56] give me a heart attack or stroke which
[443.04 - 446.28] two of my grandfathers did get because
[444.56 - 447.56] they drank too much of coffee oh no but
[446.28 - 450.36] coffee I read this internet article no
[447.56 - 453.12] no no no no no do not go with Google by
[450.36 - 455.72] the way Google employees come to Ryan
[453.12 - 458.24] Fernando I want to tell you something in
[455.72 - 459.64] Bangalore Google comes to Ryan Fernando
[458.24 - 461.36] for diet planning and diet counseling
[459.64 - 462.72] for their webinars and seminars there
[461.36 - 464.60] will be a time when AI will be able to
[462.72 - 466.32] integrate this but still such time you
[464.60 - 469.80] need to holistically balance your
[466.32 - 472.68] nutrition with small tips okay so first
[469.80 - 475.20] point 20224 the people that are there in

[501.24 - 506.00] luxury Vehicles which are worth maybe
[503.16 - 508.60] about $100 million what's what's the
[506.00 - 512.12] point of having all of these vehicles if
[508.60 - 514.84] my body is not the Rollo of my
[512.12 - 517.08] life please understand I work with some
[514.84 - 519.64] of the richest people in the world about
[517.08 - 521.24] half a dozen billionaires with me they
[519.64 - 523.24] come for a nutrition plan because they
[521.24 - 525.00] want to bepoke how they should be eating
[523.24 - 526.76] scientifically then I ask them why do
[525.00 - 528.84] you want to do this they say Ryan
[526.76 - 530.32] Fernando we can't change our body we can
[528.84 - 531.72] change our house we can change our jet
[530.32 - 533.40] we can change our car we can change our
[531.72 - 536.04] company we can change our staff we can
[533.40 - 538.68] change our spouse you can't change your
[536.04 - 539.72] mother father and your sibling and your
[538.68 - 541.00] human body
[539.72 - 541.84] so there's a very nice joke in my house
[541.00 - 543.32] my wife keep saying why do you keep
[541.84 - 545.52] telling people in seminar you can change
[543.32 - 548.00] your spouse it's true you can change
[545.52 - 549.04] everything except your human body so
[548.00 - 551.20] what are you
[549.04 - 553.76] doing why are you behaving that you need
[551.20 - 555.32] a school principal in 2024 where there's
[553.76 - 558.40] enough of knowledge for you to get your
[555.32 - 560.76] backside off a couch and start putting
[558.40 - 562.40] down written resolutions like you do in
[560.76 - 564.00] your job you go to work because a boss
[562.40 - 565.28] is tracking you you go to work because
[564.00 - 566.40] you're an entrepreneur you go to work
[565.28 - 568.32] because you have a Top Line you have a
[566.40 - 570.56] bottom line and you have to perform you
[568.32 - 573.00] go to work and give the best that you
[570.56 - 574.48] can from this body because you feel
[573.00 - 576.36] that's the right thing to do what about
[574.48 - 579.12] your body what about your health is it
[576.36 - 582.00] not the New Wealth so can you tell me
[579.12 - 584.20] what have you written can you tell me
[582.00 - 587.00] what have you written down as a
[584.20 - 588.76] philosophy in 20124 pick one point my
[587.00 - 589.84] one point is I want to gain four kges of
[588.76 - 591.96] muscle this
[589.84 - 594.64] year I'm going to find it very difficult
[591.96 - 596.24] at the age of 48 to gain 4 kges of
[594.64 - 598.00] muscle because as you grow older in the
[596.24 - 599.60] male you lose testosterone if you're a
[598.00 - 602.16] female you lose test testosterone you
[599.60 - 603.92] lose estrogen so we all gaining only fat
[602.16 - 606.36] but what is it that I need to do so when
[603.92 - 610.08] I write down a quantifiable goal to my
[606.36 - 612.36] health don't say I want to live nice I
[610.08 - 615.16] want to have good body I want to have
[612.36 - 618.08] nice hair I want to lose weight do not
[615.16 - 620.80] use qualitative goals you are all
[618.08 - 623.20] Finance Executives use quantifiable
[620.80 - 625.28] goals I want to reduce BP no no no no no
[623.20 - 628.04] I want to reduce my BP by Five Points I
[625.28 - 630.60] want to reduce my blood sugar by 60
[628.04 - 633.12] points but hang on Ryan Fernando I don't
[630.60 - 636.12] even know my sugar level ah you don't
[633.12 - 638.88] know your sugar level in 2024 how dumb
[636.12 - 640.80] can we get now artificial intelligence
[638.88 - 642.68] the new watches are even tracking BP and
[640.80 - 644.44] sweat what are we doing oh how many
[642.68 - 645.92] dollars how much transition how much
[644.44 - 647.60] Arbitrage how much all of that stuff you
[645.92 - 649.00] are all gurus on that but when it comes
[647.60 - 652.72] to the guru of your body you're putting
[649.00 - 654.96] it under the rug so I want you to First
[652.72 - 656.56] make a resolution for yourself like how
[654.96 - 658.40] I met page many years ago he made a
[656.56 - 661.48] resolution he said Ryan Fernando how can
[658.40 - 664.80] I make my body younger at 48 years of
[661.48 - 666.60] age that's my age my metabolic age is 33
[664.80 - 668.80] so I'm now going to give you incentive
[666.60 - 671.40] to start taking care of your health I

[1003.52 - 1009.68] real estate all of us live in it
[1006.16 - 1012.20] as chasis chasis is an Indian term which
[1009.68 - 1014.56] is meaning
[1012.20 - 1017.52] tune
[1014.56 - 1020.48] tenant so I'm I'm trying to convince the
[1017.52 - 1022.40] world the day you understand that you
[1020.48 - 1024.28] are the most valuable asset and you
[1022.40 - 1026.48] believe in self-love and you believe in
[1024.28 - 1028.52] taking care of yourself you'll start
[1026.48 - 1031.00] saying what can I do to stop being lazy
[1028.52 - 1032.96] and living like a tenant in my body so
[1031.00 - 1035.04] I'm hoping out of the 60 or 100 people
[1032.96 - 1037.08] that are here in this seminar today I'm
[1035.04 - 1038.32] just hoping that one of you decides to
[1037.08 - 1040.12] make the change saying that you know
[1038.32 - 1041.08] what I'm going to write down a few goals
[1040.12 - 1043.12] I'm going to start behaving like a
[1041.08 - 1047.24] tenant and don't worry if you fail to
[1043.12 - 1048.92] pay the bills in a few months but start
[1047.24 - 1051.88] like 365 days in the year
[1048.92 - 1053.80] can you get 8 hours of sleep but Ryan I
[1051.88 - 1055.72] did only 100 days I'll be like yeah you
[1053.80 - 1057.56] got 100 days of 8 hours of sleep balance
[1055.72 - 1059.88] 7 hours and maybe in Balance 100 days
[1057.56 - 1063.56] you got five to six hours my point is
[1059.88 - 1066.24] once you start tracking the next year oh
[1063.56 - 1068.96] 2024 I got 100 days of 8 hour sleep this
[1066.24 - 1072.04] year I'm going to get 120 days you
[1068.96 - 1074.72] improve your body year on
[1072.04 - 1076.24] year I want to share something with you
[1074.72 - 1077.40] uh if you if you look at this if if I
[1076.24 - 1079.44] have to go this way if you look at this
[1077.40 - 1081.48] whole list over here right can you see
[1079.44 - 1084.96] over here the fat
[1081.48 - 1087.20] cell yesi page how many years does fat
[1084.96 - 1090.40] cells reside in the human body eight
[1087.20 - 1092.00] years and can you look at maybe the uh
[1090.40 - 1094.28] the lung cell or the stomach cell
[1092.00 - 1095.96] stomach cell is the third from the top
[1094.28 - 1098.92] uh two to nine days right so your
[1095.96 - 1098.92] stomach cell is two to nine
[1099.92 - 1104.32] days but after all of that and all fat
[1102.64 - 1106.80] comes and
[1104.32 - 1108.68] say I'm your friend I am fat I'm going
[1106.80 - 1112.92] to sit in your hips and your bum and
[1108.68 - 1112.92] waste and everything and then it
[1115.04 - 1119.28] says you can't take me out of your body
[1117.32 - 1122.04] you can't you can't serve me an eviction
[1119.28 - 1125.52] notice for eight years hak is thinking
[1122.04 - 1127.96] oh my God if I eat another Bata in 2024
[1125.52 - 1132.20] that Bata is going to stay as me as a
[1127.96 - 1136.76] tenant so I am trying to convince people
[1132.20 - 1140.60] to understand that as you gain weight in
[1136.76 - 1142.16] your working career you keep saying I'll
[1140.60 - 1143.72] do it next year I'll do it next year
[1142.16 - 1147.24] I'll do it in the next job I'll do it in
[1143.72 - 1150.12] the next business no that guy once it'ss
[1147.24 - 1152.80] inside of you is is for eight
[1150.12 - 1154.40] years I understood this fortunately
[1152.80 - 1157.16] because I'm in this business of the
[1154.40 - 1159.84] balance sheet about 20 years ago so
[1157.16 - 1161.48] hence I keep my weight in check which
[1159.84 - 1162.76] means that's why my body age is 33
[1161.48 - 1165.36] because when I stand on the wing scale I
[1162.76 - 1167.40] have a body fat percentage of 18% and
[1165.36 - 1169.56] that's the age of a 33 percentage of a
[1167.40 - 1171.48] 33 year old but a person is 48 should
[1169.56 - 1174.08] have 29% body
[1171.48 - 1177.00] fat so once you begin to understand
[1174.08 - 1179.60] these constructs by the way uh what is
[1177.00 - 1183.72] not listed over here is muscle cells
[1179.60 - 1186.20] muscle cells lie with you for 14
[1183.72 - 1188.36] years so if you can change your muscle
[1186.20 - 1190.20] cells and build muscle especially women
[1188.36 - 1191.96] I'm recommending my wife just gone for
[1190.20 - 1194.24] weight training right now so most
[1191.96 - 1195.92] important thing okay so we were talking
[1194.24 - 1199.72] about fat and eight years in the body
[1195.92 - 1201.72] now we need to do 10,000 thousand steps
[1199.72 - 1203.12] for maintenance walk and talk walk and
[1201.72 - 1205.32] talk walk and talk I'm actually here in
[1203.12 - 1207.76] the seminar and I'm dancing around most
[1205.32 - 1210.76] of you are sitting down so now I've got
[1207.76 - 1212.92] a few thousand steps yeah okay buy a
[1210.76 - 1215.24] walking desk take your best friend for a
[1212.92 - 1217.64] walk take your dog for a walk right
[1215.24 - 1218.76] let's let's have a meeting so page
[1217.64 - 1220.92] whenever you meet with your leadership
[1218.76 - 1221.84] team and all the stuff hey by let's go
[1220.92 - 1224.36] for a
[1221.84 - 1226.32] walk because as you begin to move you
[1224.36 - 1228.24] even put more blood circulation in your
[1226.32 - 1230.84] head now the reason we're gaining we
[1228.24 - 1234.16] weight the reason we're gaining weight
[1230.84 - 1238.20] is because we are a DJ
[1234.16 - 1238.20] Society DJ means desk
[1240.64 - 1246.52] jockey hello hello is my signal working
[1244.40 - 1247.48] I'm a desk jocky hello that's all that's
[1246.52 - 1250.28] all is the
[1247.48 - 1252.64] movement sit in your car drive to the
[1250.28 - 1254.36] supermarket go there come back to the
[1252.64 - 1256.08] nearest parking lot near to the to the
[1254.36 - 1257.80] to the shopping gate then drive to the
[1256.08 - 1259.64] basement of my house and go up the lift
[1257.80 - 1262.32] and I do this you do this all of us do
[1259.64 - 1265.88] it so we have to construct physical
[1262.32 - 1267.64] movement okay the other thing which is a
[1265.88 - 1269.92] secret and I'm not a very good expert
[1267.64 - 1271.52] but I go to a breath coach and what I've
[1269.92 - 1274.96] understood is we are all shallow
[1271.52 - 1278.64] breathers if you can breathe 5 seconds
[1274.96 - 1280.88] in slow breath 5 second hold and 5c out
[1278.64 - 1284.28] apparently this lowers your
[1280.88 - 1286.88] parasympathetic systems adrenal and and
[1284.28 - 1289.52] and anxiety and when that comes down you
[1286.88 - 1292.52] store lesser fat so here's a secret that
[1289.52 - 1295.28] I've given all my billion dollar clients
[1292.52 - 1298.08] after every phone call after every
[1295.28 - 1300.76] meeting after every webinar after every
[1298.08 - 1302.56] any interaction with anyone take 25
[1300.76 - 1304.80] seconds out for your breath and you go
[1302.56 - 1304.80] like
[1306.96 - 1310.28] this now I'm
[1316.56 - 1319.36] holding and if you look at at your
[1318.24 - 1321.08] exercise variable your heart rate is
[1319.36 - 1324.36] just dropped by three point if you could
[1321.08 - 1326.64] do three such breaths so 25 into into 3
[1324.36 - 1331.24] seconds sorry sorry my math is very bad
[1326.64 - 1332.68] CH 555 is 15 seconds 15 seconds I see
[1331.24 - 1333.76] I've made your life even more easier 15
[1332.68 - 1335.76] seconds by the way there are people who
[1333.76 - 1338.40] can do 10c breath hold my yoga
[1335.76 - 1340.96] instructor is 22 seconds so 22 seconds
[1338.40 - 1343.40] in slow breath in slow hold for 20
[1340.96 - 1345.36] seconds and out but for most people you
[1343.40 - 1348.72] and me arm admy just Joy let's do five
[1345.36 - 1350.92] in five hold five out now people like me
[1348.72 - 1352.92] are gurus of wisdom of nutrition and
[1350.92 - 1354.76] health and wellness we give you this
[1352.92 - 1356.40] I'll tell you where people fail people
[1354.76 - 1357.88] fail to practice because there is no
[1356.40 - 1360.56] guru at their desk telling them what to
[1357.88 - 1363.60] do so what can you do there are nice
[1360.56 - 1365.28] apps on Apple and Android which are
[1363.60 - 1367.40] known as breath apps download one breath
[1365.28 - 1369.44] app put it on your desktop and make it a
[1367.40 - 1371.60] point if your HR can convince you to
[1369.44 - 1373.20] take a breath work every day this will
[1371.60 - 1374.84] help you if your HR can convince you to
[1373.20 - 1377.28] take 10,000 steps or stand at your deck
[1374.84 - 1380.92] and do something please do this this is
[1377.28 - 1380.92] the first part of my diet
[1386.12 - 1390.72] plan this is the first basic stuff right
[1389.36 - 1393.24] and and what happens is if you do this
[1390.72 - 1394.24] correctly I just ate Christmas plum cake
[1393.24 - 1396.32] nice big
[1394.24 - 1398.24] piece because I know I'm going to work
[1396.32 - 1399.64] out I know I'm going to eat well for the
[1398.24 - 1402.44] rest of the day but I'm going to enjoy
[1399.64 - 1404.84] that plum cake guilt-free as a landlord
[1402.44 - 1406.24] in my body although my blood test might
[1404.84 - 1408.08] say much differently next month when I
[1406.24 - 1409.56] do it like he R your sugar's gone up but
[1408.08 - 1412.44] I'll keep you posted on
[1409.56 - 1414.84] that so nutrition now is bioindividual
[1412.44 - 1416.36] this concept is Ryan sir can I eat Mari
[1414.84 - 1417.96] biscuit can I have tea can I have coffee
[1416.36 - 1420.12] can I have dud can I have
[1417.96 - 1421.92] milk in fact the other day I was in a
[1420.12 - 1425.40] podcast and the guy's like sir do you
[1421.92 - 1430.12] take any stance on any food and I said n
[1425.40 - 1433.16] Sab I'm a judge I'm a judge on my right
[1430.12 - 1436.36] side is the defendant on my left side is
[1433.16 - 1438.40] the prosecutor in between is papaya my
[1436.36 - 1440.40] candidate stands in front of me
[1438.40 - 1442.96] and the candidate says sir should I eat
[1440.40 - 1444.48] papaya so I ask the defense attorney
[1442.96 - 1446.52] what do you feel papaya is very good in
[1444.48 - 1449.24] beta cartin it's very good in fiber it
[1446.52 - 1451.96] has got asanin in it it's got blah blah
[1449.24 - 1455.20] blah vitamin A which is high in it Lev
[1451.96 - 1457.04] other side prosecutor no sir this is a
[1455.20 - 1459.16] pregnant lady papaya could be abortive
[1457.04 - 1461.96] in effect you can't give papaya to the
[1459.16 - 1464.16] so now as judge I have to pass execution
[1461.96 - 1466.12] judgment on my client and I say
[1464.16 - 1468.12] considering all the inputs that I've got
[1466.12 - 1470.28] I deem papaya fit for you but for the
[1468.12 - 1472.36] other person no papaya for that person
[1470.28 - 1474.00] nutrition is very bio individual please
[1472.36 - 1476.84] understand you have been taught to eat
[1474.00 - 1479.56] out of love and culture from d ma from

[1490.36 - 1495.56] had adult acne till I was 35 nobody ever
[1493.48 - 1499.08] told me and then when I did my genetic
[1495.56 - 1500.28] testing that guy say gentic test testing

[1503.48 - 1507.52] hello Ryan Fernando Goan should not eat
[1505.16 - 1508.84] bread you know goans are called paas
[1507.52 - 1512.24] right we eat bread at breakfast lunch
[1508.84 - 1515.16] and dinner so look at it culturally I
[1512.24 - 1517.52] was thought I had a I had a jot harani
[1515.16 - 1518.68] who had a Cow Shed and 60 cows and I

[1518.68 - 1522.84] intolerant hey
[1520.72 - 1523.68] do last 20 Generations we' have been
[1522.84 - 1527.28] drinking
[1523.68 - 1529.60] milk but genetically the the science is
[1527.28 - 1531.84] now evolving how to eat scientifically
[1529.60 - 1533.76] so I'm just saying that what you could
[1531.84 - 1535.72] start with is a blood test a genetic
[1533.76 - 1537.52] test and a microbiome test these are
[1535.72 - 1538.96] some very fascinating pieces of advice
[1537.52 - 1540.28] because then when you go on vacation
[1538.96 - 1541.60] you're looking at everyone eating bread
[1540.28 - 1544.20] and then like would you like to try this
[1541.60 - 1546.16] s bread it's gluten low no call up the
[1544.20 - 1547.56] chef before I reach hello Ryan Fernando

[1547.56 - 1550.52] making glutenfree bread for
[1552.32 - 1556.80] you few things on nutrition that I'd
[1554.76 - 1559.92] like to convey to you you can add
[1556.80 - 1562.72] sprouts and micro greens to your charts
[1559.92 - 1566.44] to your poas to your snacks micro greens
[1562.72 - 1568.12] or Sprouts are amazing two issues nobody
[1566.44 - 1570.44] likes the taste nobody has the time to
[1568.12 - 1572.92] prepare it solution for no time to
[1570.44 - 1575.04] prepare for it go to your startups in
[1572.92 - 1576.72] Dubai or in bang wherever who are making
[1575.04 - 1578.88] the microgreens buy it for them get a
[1576.72 - 1581.64] subscription second
[1578.88 - 1583.84] point you know how you have to do sips
[1581.64 - 1585.12] systematic investment plan you want to
[1583.84 - 1586.60] you want to keep that money and spend it
[1585.12 - 1588.00] on a vacation to switch cylinder what
[1586.60 - 1589.92] but something inside of you says keep
[1588.00 - 1592.44] keep aside little money keep aside it's
[1589.92 - 1594.04] painful so is sometimes eating food that
[1592.44 - 1595.12] is healthy and by the way if you add a
[1594.04 - 1596.32] little bit of vinegar you little bit of
[1595.12 - 1598.16] chat Masala a little bit of tamaron a
[1596.32 - 1601.40] little bit of Masala it actually tastes
[1598.16 - 1603.32] good adding Basin to Roy FL reduce your
[1601.40 - 1605.56] grain of carbohydrate increase your
[1603.32 - 1608.00] protein in your rtin add Curry leaves to
[1605.56 - 1609.52] your DS and subis add Moringa leaves Dal
[1608.00 - 1610.92] Chini cinnamon I don't know if you know
[1609.52 - 1612.24] this actually is a fat burner there was
[1610.92 - 1613.76] a study saying when people ate qu
[1612.24 - 1615.64] teaspoon of cinnamon be careful you get
[1613.76 - 1617.16] mouth alers it's very heat but for those
[1615.64 - 1618.92] of you dalini or cinnamon that agrees
[1617.16 - 1620.64] with you it reduces belly fat over a
[1618.92 - 1622.76] 3month period so what I do is add it to
[1620.64 - 1624.44] tea or coffee green tea green coffee
[1622.76 - 1626.28] sunflower pumpkin seeds very good for
[1624.44 - 1627.88] brain health very good for musles and
[1626.28 - 1630.12] pun there are a lot of cranky people in
[1627.88 - 1630.12] your
[1631.04 - 1635.80] office all the those complaint pots as I
[1634.08 - 1637.16] call them every time they complain just
[1635.80 - 1638.64] give them a gift of pumpkin seeds and
[1637.16 - 1640.32] sunflower seeds it helps the brain work
[1638.64 - 1641.44] very well they've got they've got a
[1640.32 - 1644.20] nutritional deficiency that's why they
[1641.44 - 1645.52] always complaining the body inside is
[1644.20 - 1647.08] telling them something and then that
[1645.52 - 1648.92] reflects in their personality trust me I
[1647.08 - 1651.28] meet people 30 minutes 30 seconds to 1
[1648.92 - 1653.68] minute I can tell you how they
[1651.28 - 1654.92] vibrating using dates raisins berries
[1653.68 - 1656.48] instead of sugars for sweetness and
[1654.92 - 1657.92] porges and pancakes I know a lot of
[1656.48 - 1659.84] people don't do porridges but you know
[1657.92 - 1661.40] when you're too busy you'll have like a
[1659.84 - 1662.76] bowl of cereal or a bowl of porridge or
[1661.40 - 1664.60] a smoothie smoothie is another version
[1662.76 - 1667.00] of a porridge or pancakes pancakes is
[1664.60 - 1668.96] our Indian stylist Dosa or the other way
[1667.00 - 1670.48] is a chapati you can put in some of
[1668.96 - 1672.64] these dates raisins and berries because
[1670.48 - 1674.72] of the antioxidant powers and their
[1672.64 - 1677.56] sweetness is better than putting Jagger
[1674.72 - 1679.80] or sugar any day by the way when you buy
[1677.56 - 1681.76] buy dates raisins berries all of these
[1679.80 - 1684.32] things one thing that I've started doing
[1681.76 - 1686.60] 5 years ago is I buy organic
[1684.32 - 1688.28] food you come to my house you will see
[1686.60 - 1689.32] those fruit flies roaming around I don't
[1688.28 - 1690.76] know if you remember in your dad Ma's
[1689.32 - 1692.24] house they used to have that basket they
[1690.76 - 1693.68] used to put over all the food because
[1692.24 - 1695.08] all these flies and kidas used to be
[1693.68 - 1696.56] around today you go to anyone's house
[1695.08 - 1699.52] there's no fly or Kea why because you're
[1696.56 - 1701.64] spraying the crop day before yesterday a
[1699.52 - 1703.20] politician farmer came for a diet

[1726.12 - 1731.40] fungicide we spray on the crop you will
[1727.84 - 1736.40] not give pomegranate to your um
[1731.40 - 1739.40] clients my housekeeping lady Mona sir
[1736.40 - 1739.40] pomegranate
[1755.88 - 1759.76] have you noticed organic food is not
[1757.48 - 1761.60] perfect spoils very quickly you'll get
[1759.76 - 1764.00] worms and LA in it very
[1761.60 - 1765.84] fast because the chemical is not sprayed
[1764.00 - 1767.84] so that guy is there which for me I see
[1765.84 - 1769.92] a l i don't go I'm like
[1767.84 - 1773.16] cool he's growing inside which means
[1769.92 - 1775.80] it's safe enough for me to eat Flip Flip

[1781.08 - 1785.16] liver and kidney for the next 20 30
[1783.04 - 1786.80] years of your life if there's nothing
[1785.16 - 1787.88] you take away from this seminar take
[1786.80 - 1789.12] away the fact that if you can eat
[1787.88 - 1791.16] organic now I know all the Indians over

[1791.16 - 1793.64] not cheating
[1793.72 - 1798.40] us I think we need to believe in a lot
[1796.32 - 1800.20] of people out there if you still don't
[1798.40 - 1802.68] believe do what I do I make friends with
[1800.20 - 1804.40] people I make friends with people so I
[1802.68 - 1806.36] buy Happy Hands in Bangalore I made
[1804.40 - 1807.72] friends with the founder mun hey manjun

[1807.72 - 1810.76] the whole story how they do poultry
[1808.96 - 1813.24] farming and all he says see what we do
[1810.76 - 1814.96] we go and find 20 villages we tell all
[1813.24 - 1816.80] the villages we will help you in farming

[2027.44 - 2032.64] she says at least at 48 years of age
[2030.00 - 2034.04] where where's my point on this she has
[2032.64 - 2036.40] figured out she doesn't want to eat
[2034.04 - 2037.88] breakfast because she doesn't feel good
[2036.40 - 2040.48] I'm not saying you should or should not
[2037.88 - 2044.76] eat breakfast I eat breakfast I'm saying
[2040.48 - 2046.76] discover Your Capacity to eat don't eat
[2044.76 - 2048.64] because ask yourself are you feeling
[2046.76 - 2050.52] hungry if you skip a meal you're not
[2048.64 - 2052.52] going to die researcher showing fasting
[2050.52 - 2055.08] for 30 hours actually rejuvenates the
[2052.52 - 2057.24] body our ancient ancestor ditch shavan
[2055.08 - 2060.04] fast Pima fast this fast that fast
[2057.24 - 2062.32] length Ramadan everything there is there
[2060.04 - 2063.76] logically documented that fasting worked
[2062.32 - 2066.24] and you know why they did fasting
[2063.76 - 2067.76] because they knew humans were too weak
[2066.24 - 2070.00] to give up food on their own so they
[2067.76 - 2071.68] need a spiritual Direction I'm giving
[2070.00 - 2074.28] you a functional Direction there was a
[2071.68 - 2076.92] Nobel Prize one on autoi where the
[2074.28 - 2079.88] Japanese medical doctor said that at 30
[2076.92 - 2082.16] to 60 hours of fasting all cancer cells
[2079.88 - 2084.36] and all fat cells in the body
[2082.16 - 2085.68] implode so when people come to me why do

[2111.80 - 2116.68] or the quadling of the carbon footprint
[2114.36 - 2117.92] on animal produce that goes into your
[2116.68 - 2121.76] system where you could have survived

[2213.72 - 2219.32] years go easy everyone post vaccin ation
[2217.00 - 2221.44] we have all had higher inflammatory
[2219.32 - 2224.68] markers the world has gotten more
[2221.44 - 2226.52] stressful more advanced so you want to
[2224.68 - 2228.24] run the rat race so you run on a
[2226.52 - 2230.12] treadmill very fast when you go to the
[2228.24 - 2232.08] gym my sincere advice to you is do what
[2230.12 - 2235.04] I do I smile in the gym and I enjoy it
[2232.08 - 2236.48] TR like our next rep by give me five
[2235.04 - 2239.32] minutes man let me enjoy it I've turned
[2236.48 - 2241.88] up in the gym no my 40 minutes workout
[2239.32 - 2243.12] is my peaceful time why because of the
[2241.88 - 2244.52] inflammatory markers people are more
[2243.12 - 2246.68] prone to heart attacks go slow and
[2244.52 - 2248.68] steady after one or two years of being
[2246.68 - 2250.12] James Bond in the gym slow and steady
[2248.68 - 2251.64] then up your level so that's why I
[2250.12 - 2254.44] recommend wear an exercise variable when
[2251.64 - 2257.80] you work out do not cross 140 150 heart
[2254.44 - 2257.80] rate in the gym if you're on
[2259.36 - 2263.36] noice W you have a tea coffee machine in
[2261.72 - 2266.36] your
[2263.36 - 2267.60] office yes we do have I'm going to save
[2266.36 - 2269.64] you some money okay whatever you save
[2267.60 - 2273.40] you send to me as a New Year's gift next
[2269.64 - 2275.60] year if you drink one cup of coffee or
[2273.40 - 2278.64] tea with milk 100 ml milk 2 teaspoon
[2275.60 - 2280.20] sugar himaki if you drink two cups of
[2278.64 - 2281.40] tea or milk himaki I'm not picking on
[2280.20 - 2282.76] you you're the only person I can see in
[2281.40 - 2284.36] the seminar today okay forgive me for
[2282.76 - 2287.60] this but himaki if you drink two cups of
[2284.36 - 2288.96] milk and tea so white milk with sugar in
[2287.60 - 2291.64] the full year on one cup you're
[2288.96 - 2292.80] consuming 27 lers of milk if you drink
[2291.64 - 2296.32] two cups of tea or coffee you're
[2292.80 - 2299.20] consuming 55 lers of milk
[2296.32 - 2301.84] 55 right over here I've been very nice I
[2299.20 - 2303.92] said you need to walk for 59 days of 1
[2301.84 - 2306.68] hour Walk To Burn only those cup one cup
[2303.92 - 2308.76] of coffee so many of you will say yes
[2306.68 - 2310.56] the 59 hours of walking is equivalent to
[2308.76 - 2312.64] 3 kages of weight gain a
[2310.56 - 2314.72] year and the two cups of coffee is
[2312.64 - 2317.32] equivalent to about 5.5 kages of weight
[2314.72 - 2319.04] gain in a year now you want to know why
[2317.32 - 2320.60] when you join left college and join the
[2319.04 - 2322.12] workplace you put on weight it's because
[2320.60 - 2325.04] you drink too much of milk tea and milk
[2322.12 - 2327.24] coffee solution black tea black coffee
[2325.04 - 2330.88] drink plain water the human race is
[2327.24 - 2330.88] eating too much drinking too
[2331.16 - 2334.52] much simple
[2335.52 - 2340.64] water black
[2338.12 - 2342.60] tea zero calorie zero calorie no weight
[2340.64 - 2343.88] came in the year no sir but it doesn't
[2342.60 - 2345.44] taste very good and all that stuff I'm
[2343.88 - 2346.72] used to having coffee I'm too stressed
[2345.44 - 2348.56] out okay little bit of caffeine over
[2346.72 - 2350.44] here little bit of black coffee sir it
[2348.56 - 2352.84] doesn't taste very good you are landlord
[2350.44 - 2355.40] or you tenant in your body tastebud is
[2352.84 - 2358.48] the owner or you are the owner food for
[2355.40 - 2361.60] thought these are small changes that
[2358.48 - 2364.64] result in macroscopic weight loss small
[2361.60 - 2366.48] changes just on tea coffee page print
[2364.64 - 2368.36] out this slide no put it in front of the
[2366.48 - 2370.92] tea coffee machine I did this in a
[2368.36 - 2372.92] Fortune 500 company the HR came back to
[2370.92 - 2375.84] me and said there was complaint from
[2372.92 - 2377.84] staff why are you taking away our tea or
[2375.84 - 2380.80] coffee we didn't take away the tea or
[2377.84 - 2382.32] coffee we put this poster up so the
[2380.80 - 2385.52] consumption according to them dropped by
[2382.32 - 2388.08] a whopping 65% in one month everyone
[2385.52 - 2391.92] shifted to green tea black
[2388.08 - 2393.60] tea so awareness allows you to get to
[2391.92 - 2395.88] the next
[2393.60 - 2397.48] level when you travel and you go
[2395.88 - 2399.76] different parts the world what what
[2397.48 - 2401.00] could you do eat a healthy snack before
[2399.76 - 2402.68] you leave home drink a lot of water
[2401.00 - 2405.40] before your meal when you go out to
[2402.68 - 2407.72] restaurants choose steam Grill roasted
[2405.40 - 2410.76] options share it with a colleague so you
[2407.72 - 2411.88] split it down don't do fried potatoes do
[2410.76 - 2413.24] let like can you get a steak or
[2411.88 - 2414.28] something like that say hey can you give
[2413.24 - 2416.12] me instead of potatoes could you give me
[2414.28 - 2418.32] vegetables sauteed vegetables always
[2416.12 - 2420.60] start with a soup or a salad research
[2418.32 - 2422.44] has shown that this glycemic index Spike
[2420.60 - 2424.80] the sugar spike is actually lower if you
[2422.44 - 2427.04] start with a salad or a soup I've worn
[2424.80 - 2429.16] one of those CGM devices last
[2427.04 - 2430.88] it's absolutely true so you eat all your
[2429.16 - 2432.48] gaspo all your salad all your vegetables
[2430.88 - 2435.24] first and then eat your grain last
[2432.48 - 2438.92] protein second uh choose tomato B sauces
[2435.24 - 2438.92] over creamy sauces that would be a good
[2439.88 - 2445.20] option so my cop my brain is made up of
[2442.64 - 2446.64] 60% fat bankage this is very interesting
[2445.20 - 2448.40] okay if you want to build a billion
[2446.64 - 2450.84] dollar
[2448.40 - 2454.08] organization the health of your employee
[2450.84 - 2455.32] is directly proportional to the brain
[2454.08 - 2458.16] that they
[2455.32 - 2461.32] incubate and the brain is made up of 60%
[2458.16 - 2464.32] of fat unfortunately sergy the fat in
[2461.32 - 2466.28] our diet is the bad fat that goes and
[2464.32 - 2468.72] reconstructs the Brain over a 10-e
[2466.28 - 2470.32] period so this 27 year old young team by
[2468.72 - 2473.32] the time they said
[2470.32 - 2476.48] 37
[2473.32 - 2477.96] K seriously I have actually changed
[2476.48 - 2479.36] leadership teams over two years I've
[2477.96 - 2481.40] done a pin prick test checked the
[2479.36 - 2483.08] omega-3 levels B omega3 levels in the
[2481.40 - 2484.80] gutter then we started supplementing
[2483.08 - 2486.52] with flax seed we started supplementing
[2484.80 - 2488.20] with Tria seed we started eating more
[2486.52 - 2489.88] Walnut and we added two fish oil
[2488.20 - 2491.80] capsules or two vegan algae Omega
[2489.88 - 2494.72] capsules per day A year later we checked
[2491.80 - 2496.68] again the levels had gone up people on a
[2494.72 - 2498.60] verbal basis reported back to me how
[2496.68 - 2501.76] good they felt in the brain how deep
[2498.60 - 2504.40] their sleep became how less suicidal
[2501.76 - 2506.72] they felt I had four people come up to
[2504.40 - 2509.88] me saying we had like Suicidal
[2506.72 - 2512.80] Tendencies CLE my job shoot my
[2509.88 - 2516.40] boss I hope nobody wants to shoot you
[2512.80 - 2518.60] page but if you want safety don't don't
[2516.40 - 2521.32] get more security get more omega-3 in
[2518.60 - 2523.00] everyone's diet and 50% of this brain is
[2521.32 - 2524.76] made up of Omega-3 you know my wife says
[2523.00 - 2527.88] I'm very
[2524.76 - 2527.88] insensitive they
[2529.00 - 2533.24] dode did not eat correctly wife like how
[2531.60 - 2534.80] can you be so insensitive there is
[2533.24 - 2537.68] documented research from American
[2534.80 - 2539.16] prisons on violence and suicide they
[2537.68 - 2541.20] actually took two prison blocks in
[2539.16 - 2542.84] Brazil or America some Australia I
[2541.20 - 2544.44] remember reading the scientific paper so
[2542.84 - 2547.12] they fed them omega-3 and removed the
[2544.44 - 2548.48] bad fats and a multivit wom another
[2547.12 - 2551.32] block they didn't do anything the
[2548.48 - 2553.80] incidences of violence came down by over
[2551.32 - 2556.44] 55% incidences of suicidal tendency
[2553.80 - 2556.44] dropped almost
[2557.16 - 2562.84] 90% so when I see employees sad in an
[2560.84 - 2565.20] organization maybe it's the stimulus of
[2562.84 - 2567.12] the people around them but what if it's
[2565.20 - 2568.96] biological what if the fault is that
[2567.12 - 2571.44] you're not eating correctly what is it
[2568.96 - 2573.32] if the fault is that you do not know
[2571.44 - 2575.36] that your grandmother and grandfather
[2573.32 - 2578.28] did the wrong jwy and brought into your
[2575.36 - 2582.16] family and omeg ga3 deficient
[2578.28 - 2584.28] Gene ah this is
[2582.16 - 2586.28] 2024 so stop spending your money and
[2584.28 - 2587.84] buying a stupid iPhone that cost one and
[2586.28 - 2589.52] a half lakh rupees and spend some money
[2587.84 - 2592.24] on your bloody blood test and your
[2589.52 - 2593.20] genetic test and your health because
[2592.24 - 2595.24] you're going to change that iPhone
[2593.20 - 2597.56] you'll be able to buy a new iPhone but
[2595.24 - 2598.96] you won't be able to change your brain
[2597.56 - 2601.48] and then when you're 60 years
[2598.96 - 2604.04] old I retired from pun's company I'm
[2601.48 - 2605.48] good and then doctor says sorry sir 50%
[2604.04 - 2607.64] of your brain is gone now you have to
[2605.48 - 2609.72] take a uh Parkin cels and Alzheimer's
[2607.64 - 2613.36] medication all because you did not take
[2609.72 - 2613.36] care of your health in your 20s 30s and
[2613.60 - 2618.20] 40s okay I need to move faster because U
[2616.56 - 2622.28] got four more slides okay this is what
[2618.20 - 2625.08] you need to do okay all restaurants use
[2622.28 - 2627.04] palm oil globally palm oil is daa palm
[2625.08 - 2628.28] oil is neutral in flavor which is
[2627.04 - 2630.44] globally why it's preferred by all
[2628.28 - 2632.64] restaurants Palm oil has high level of
[2630.44 - 2634.28] arconic acids which blocks your arteries
[2632.64 - 2637.20] people say hey why is India getting so
[2634.28 - 2641.00] many heart attacks you want to do one
[2637.20 - 2643.72] thing page Google up the palm oil import
[2641.00 - 2646.64] over the last 10 years Google up how
[2643.72 - 2648.80] nobody noticed two years ago the Finance
[2646.64 - 2650.56] Minister dropped the import Duty on palm
[2648.80 - 2652.52] oil because during the pandemic the
[2650.56 - 2654.72] farmers couldn't grow enough of natural
[2652.52 - 2656.64] ground nut and all of these other oils
[2654.72 - 2658.64] so there was a deficiency of oil to keep
[2656.64 - 2661.12] markets held correctly for the Common
[2658.64 - 2663.08] Man for oil grain and oil is the most
[2661.12 - 2664.80] important not to go up dro the import
[2663.08 - 2667.52] Duty so palm oil would come in palm oil
[2664.80 - 2670.64] flooded the market wow great
[2667.52 - 2672.84] boom nobody has talked about this as a
[2670.64 - 2675.96] guy who studied at IM am aabad I don't
[2672.84 - 2677.40] advertise that a lot I read the budget

[2970.04 - 2975.16] quite a good takeway for me of course
[2971.92 - 2976.48] I've been following through your team uh
[2975.16 - 2977.88] uh you know a couple of things on a
[2976.48 - 2980.32] daily basis but a few more takea away
[2977.88 - 2981.64] for me today especially sleeping on time
[2980.32 - 2983.16] uh whether 6 or8 hours that's a
[2981.64 - 2985.28] different discussion but at least we
[2983.16 - 2986.92] start sleeping on time yeah uh coming
[2985.28 - 2989.12] very quickly uh you know in the interest
[2986.92 - 2991.32] of time you know the recently again that
[2989.12 - 2993.20] came from bangaluru from Mr Naran morti
[2991.32 - 2995.04] when he quoted that one must work for 70
[2993.20 - 2996.32] hours and when we hear youth complaining
[2995.04 - 2998.24] about work
[2996.32 - 3000.56] and you know work in health or work life
[2998.24 - 3003.00] balance what's your take on the commment
[3000.56 - 3006.48] which Mr Nar M made about that youth
[3003.00 - 3008.48] should work more and uh work work life
[3006.48 - 3009.84] balance is not uh the discussion should
[3008.48 - 3011.64] for them yeah I'm sure you heard of that
[3009.84 - 3014.00] when yes yes I did I did I did I was
[3011.64 - 3016.68] asked this question once before and uh
[3014.00 - 3017.52] there are two parts to this okay I ask
[3016.68 - 3019.76] every
[3017.52 - 3021.64] youngster would if given a chance would
[3019.76 - 3024.04] you go and try and win an Olympic medal
[3021.64 - 3026.48] and most people say yes you are
[3024.04 - 3028.64] Olympians in the workplace your gold
[3026.48 - 3030.92] medal is the bank balance you accumulate
[3028.64 - 3033.28] every year I was the youngest business
[3030.92 - 3036.52] head uh in a pharmaceutical South Indian
[3033.28 - 3039.24] marw firm at the age of 31 the next
[3036.52 - 3041.64] youngest business head was 61 they only
[3039.24 - 3042.76] took old people the reason I became the
[3041.64 - 3045.48] youngest business head is because I
[3042.76 - 3049.80] worked very hard did I ignore my health
[3045.48 - 3052.16] absolutely yes I did so now I am on the
[3049.80 - 3054.32] other side of the coin as a health coach
[3052.16 - 3057.68] so I tell the youngsters work
[3054.32 - 3060.48] intelligently smart use AI use your
[3057.68 - 3063.80] technology be disciplined don't get
[3060.48 - 3066.12] distracted by social media at work so be
[3063.80 - 3069.00] productive for four hours or 5 hours the
[3066.12 - 3071.16] balance time when you go away home 5
[3069.00 - 3074.56] hours 6 hours at home get that one hour
[3071.16 - 3075.88] of workout get that uh nutrition at work
[3074.56 - 3077.88] in the morning before you go to work and
[3075.88 - 3080.60] when you come back from the work bang on
[3077.88 - 3082.56] sleep as much as possible breathe in
[3080.60 - 3084.80] your car so when you do all of these
[3082.56 - 3087.52] hacks assume you want to hit 70 hours
[3084.80 - 3089.40] what is 70 hours so for those of you who
[3087.52 - 3092.64] work 5 days a week it means you have to
[3089.40 - 3094.60] cross 13 hours a day which is quite
[3092.64 - 3095.96] tough but if you work 6 days a week
[3094.60 - 3099.40] little bit easier if you work s days a
[3095.96 - 3102.08] week quite easy 7even t a 7 10 hours a
[3099.40 - 3103.88] day now as an entrepreneur earlier I was
[3102.08 - 3105.20] an employee as an entrepreneur I will
[3103.88 - 3106.56] tell you the pros and cons of being an
[3105.20 - 3108.28] entrepreneur the cons of being an
[3106.56 - 3109.88] entrepreneur is there's no clock in and
[3108.28 - 3110.92] clock out you are married to your
[3109.88 - 3112.64] business you're married to your
[3110.92 - 3116.00] employees you're married to always
[3112.64 - 3118.08] working because it is your other baby
[3116.00 - 3121.08] but if you're an employee it is not your
[3118.08 - 3124.76] baby but my advice to everybody
[3121.08 - 3126.96] is if you want a larger pile of the
[3124.76 - 3129.28] share of profit it comes in your
[3126.96 - 3131.08] salaries and bonuses then you need to
[3129.28 - 3133.08] work for that it's a reward system it's
[3131.08 - 3135.52] a capitalistic system in the process of
[3133.08 - 3138.60] doing this 70 hours if you do the
[3135.52 - 3139.96] calculation 8 hours 128s are 72 you got
[3138.60 - 3142.88] 72 hours for
[3139.96 - 3145.48] Sleep 70 hours for working so the
[3142.88 - 3149.08] balance is how you manage that
[3145.48 - 3151.80] extracurricular time and in this 10
[3149.08 - 3154.12] hours of working you eat well you eat
[3151.80 - 3155.52] really well you eat expensive and you
[3154.12 - 3157.72] make sure you negotiate with your boss
[3155.52 - 3159.24] that you can go for a 45 minute workout
[3157.72 - 3162.28] during your lunch
[3159.24 - 3163.64] break or you get a chance to leave at
[3162.28 - 3165.48] 5:00 go work out and come back to the
[3163.64 - 3167.12] office and work again or you leave your
[3165.48 - 3168.40] office late at 9:00 in the evening work
[3167.12 - 3169.52] out but that's a bad idea because I told
[3168.40 - 3171.16] you not to eat 3 hours before going to
[3169.52 - 3173.00] sleep so then you need to contact me and
[3171.16 - 3174.40] how we can reject the whole thing and
[3173.00 - 3175.48] men should work out in fasted state
[3174.40 - 3176.96] which means the best time for men to
[3175.48 - 3179.76] work out is morning as soon as you wake
[3176.96 - 3181.16] up go work out shower get to work women
[3179.76 - 3184.52] should work out in fasted state which is
[3181.16 - 3186.16] all the women I would advise a work out
[3184.52 - 3187.68] um around 3:00 in the afternoon you have
[3186.16 - 3190.16] an early lunch at 12:00 and work out at
[3187.68 - 3193.24] 3:00 so these are my recommendations to
[3190.16 - 3195.84] people um and the choice is personal
[3193.24 - 3198.04] Evolution has made people uh to to be
[3195.84 - 3200.00] the Warriors in the tribe so you'll run
[3198.04 - 3202.20] and go to the next Village and plunder
[3200.00 - 3203.60] then there'll be the 30% of the tribe
[3202.20 - 3204.60] which is they'll see what the leader is
[3203.60 - 3206.40] doing and follow the leader and then
[3204.60 - 3208.08] there's 30% the tribe that'll sit like
[3206.40 - 3209.64] I'm not going to go to war today so
[3208.08 - 3211.28] Evolution has made some of us to be
[3209.64 - 3212.88] go-getters some of us to sit in the
[3211.28 - 3214.68] middle of the pie and some of us to be
[3212.88 - 3216.40] completely laid back figure out which
[3214.68 - 3217.60] one you are there's no harm in it and if
[3216.40 - 3219.08] you're the guy who's going to be like
[3217.60 - 3220.92] sitting down and you guys do all the
[3219.08 - 3222.84] work open up a beach hack and go and run
[3220.92 - 3224.24] a business from there that's the best
[3222.84 - 3227.48] thing you could
[3224.24 - 3229.88] do thanks man thank you so much you know
[3227.48 - 3231.24] uh you know very very useful I think
[3229.88 - 3233.80] your message is clear and I we will see
[3231.24 - 3235.88] definitely if uh we could have some
[3233.80 - 3237.96] option of jimming during uh just after
[3235.88 - 3239.72] the lunch hours or in the lunch break
[3237.96 - 3241.04] very quickly second one you know we've
[3239.72 - 3243.00] been hearing about a lot about
[3241.04 - 3244.60] intermittent fasting what quickly you
[3243.00 - 3246.88] like to share you know what is the right
[3244.60 - 3248.88] way of executing intermittent fasting if
[3246.88 - 3250.44] that work you did spoke about the you
[3248.88 - 3252.12] know religious what we have you know
[3250.44 - 3253.56] this fasting and otherwise but
[3252.12 - 3255.28] intermittent fasting has been growing I
[3253.56 - 3257.64] mean have been people have been using
[3255.28 - 3260.00] this what's your suggestions to our
[3257.64 - 3261.68] listeners very very simple there are two
[3260.00 - 3263.24] ways to do intermittent fasting either
[3261.68 - 3265.36] you're a morning person or you're a
[3263.24 - 3268.24] night person if you're a morning person
[3265.36 - 3270.68] and you love your breakfast eat early
[3268.24 - 3271.88] then eat very early your dinner finish
[3270.68 - 3274.32] your dinner at
[3271.88 - 3276.64] 5:00 if you're an evening person then
[3274.32 - 3278.80] eat your breakfast at 12:31 and eat your
[3276.64 - 3280.92] last meal at 8:00 this is the best way
[3278.80 - 3282.60] to eat intermittent fasting the novice
[3280.92 - 3284.60] intermittent faster can do 8 hours of
[3282.60 - 3288.24] eating window meaning I'll eat my
[3284.60 - 3291.24] breakfast at 10:00 so 10 to 6:00 is 8
[3288.24 - 3293.84] hours or do 12 to 8:00 which is 8 hours
[3291.24 - 3297.08] this is the nvest the intermediat guys
[3293.84 - 3300.20] are 6 hours eat your breakfast at 6:00
[3297.08 - 3302.76] 12:00 and finish your dinner by 6:00 the
[3300.20 - 3304.56] the pros the guys who eat at 2:00 one
[3302.76 - 3306.20] meal and eat another meal at 6:00 and
[3304.56 - 3307.96] then they're done I think this is the
[3306.20 - 3309.96] best way to do intermittent fasting the
[3307.96 - 3311.72] scientific way also is to put a CGM
[3309.96 - 3313.52] glucose monitor on you for the heck of
[3311.72 - 3315.08] it and figure out when you eat how do
[3313.52 - 3318.68] you get sugar Spike so I recently did a
[3315.08 - 3320.68] client and we found out that her morning
[3318.68 - 3322.40] fasting created more sugar spikes so we
[3320.68 - 3324.40] shifted her entire eating to the morning
[3322.40 - 3326.32] half and so her only problem was after
[3324.40 - 3328.84] 5:00 I feel like eating because all my
[3326.32 - 3330.68] life I ate so we came up with Solutions
[3328.84 - 3333.68] which distracted her where she just
[3330.68 - 3335.32] drank specialized herbal teas or water
[3333.68 - 3337.44] and within 9 to 10 days she completely
[3335.32 - 3339.28] changed her eating cycle now what's the
[3337.44 - 3340.84] biggest problem when she goes out with
[3339.28 - 3342.00] friends they are all saying let's go to
[3340.84 - 3344.16] this restaurant she's saying let's go
[3342.00 - 3345.64] for a movie I don't want to eat let's go
[3344.16 - 3346.96] shopping but I don't want to eat and if
[3345.64 - 3349.28] they say we're going to eat she has a
[3346.96 - 3351.36] cup of green tea along with them so I
[3349.28 - 3354.08] think intermittent fasting is a thumbs
[3351.36 - 3356.64] up if you're overweight if you've got
[3354.08 - 3358.56] cholesterol diabetes IES or hyp
[3356.64 - 3360.60] hypertension I'm sorry BP hypertension
[3358.56 - 3362.96] same thing or any brain fog or digestive
[3360.60 - 3364.56] problems then please consult a medical
[3362.96 - 3365.88] nutritionist my my team are medical
[3364.56 - 3367.32] nutritionist we will do it
[3365.88 - 3368.44] scientifically for you so that you don't
[3367.32 - 3370.92] harm your
[3368.44 - 3372.84] body thanks one of the I will just pick
[3370.92 - 3375.12] up well we had have few questions let me
[3372.84 - 3376.76] go to the audience one of the audience
[3375.12 - 3379.08] have asked that what precautions should
[3376.76 - 3381.28] I take as I just finish cancer
[3379.08 - 3383.88] treatment okay so this is important we
[3381.28 - 3386.68] have an oncology division in our company
[3383.88 - 3388.80] and the the Benchmark is depending on
[3386.68 - 3390.40] male or female in female most of the
[3388.80 - 3392.04] cancers are driven by estrogen or
[3390.40 - 3393.76] progesterone from breast cancer ovarian
[3392.04 - 3395.00] point of view so there are certain foods
[3393.76 - 3396.76] you should eat and certain foods you
[3395.00 - 3398.72] should not eat if you're related to
[3396.76 - 3400.48] cancer with blood cancer digestive
[3398.72 - 3402.72] system cancer which is any of the organs
[3400.48 - 3404.36] of the human body then we have to look
[3402.72 - 3405.36] at what is the treatment that was given
[3404.36 - 3408.40] to you and when you have come out of
[3405.36 - 3411.24] cancer this is my solution number one do
[3408.40 - 3413.20] a food allergy intolerance test from
[3411.24 - 3414.88] Germany that will tell you which are the
[3413.20 - 3417.24] foods which will do kui in your body
[3414.88 - 3418.84] remove those Foods second do a DNA
[3417.24 - 3421.48] genetic test for your nutrition so
[3418.84 - 3423.28] you'll get the genetic Viewpoint of how
[3421.48 - 3425.48] to see the nutritional deficiencies in
[3423.28 - 3428.36] your body and then accordingly construct
[3425.48 - 3429.88] third do a poop a stool a potty sample
[3428.36 - 3431.52] DNA analysis called the microbiome
[3429.88 - 3433.72] analysis now this will give you a bird's
[3431.52 - 3435.56] eye view of how your microbes digest the
[3433.72 - 3437.32] food love certain foods hate certain
[3435.56 - 3439.68] foods so when you put all of this
[3437.32 - 3442.80] together now you're eating very
[3439.68 - 3444.24] scientifically as a choice of foods and
[3442.80 - 3446.12] then that's the first one then the
[3444.24 - 3447.68] second one is how much should this
[3446.12 - 3449.72] person who just suffered from cancer now
[3447.68 - 3451.56] eat so step on a wing scale what is your
[3449.72 - 3454.68] muscle what is your fat oh this person
[3451.56 - 3457.08] requires 1,200 calories a day now we
[3454.68 - 3459.36] know that when you feed cancer with
[3457.08 - 3461.40] sugar the cancer tumor grows so this
[3459.36 - 3462.84] person has come out of cancer treatment
[3461.40 - 3464.96] assuming that you've got all the cancer
[3462.84 - 3466.32] tumors we now know that this person
[3464.96 - 3468.28] probably was feeding too much of sugar
[3466.32 - 3472.04] to the cancer tumors so now the second
[3468.28 - 3474.12] decision is do I give more calories than
[3472.04 - 3476.12] required by this person or lesser and
[3474.12 - 3478.12] when I give calories cies the percentage
[3476.12 - 3480.68] of fat carbohydrate and protein is
[3478.12 - 3483.00] accordingly decided for that individual
[3480.68 - 3486.16] based on genetics and body weight and
[3483.00 - 3488.52] cancer treatment so as I always say I'm
[3486.16 - 3489.80] the judge I cannot pass execution of
[3488.52 - 3492.72] judgment on what are the right things to
[3489.80 - 3496.96] do but I do know that foods that are
[3492.72 - 3498.36] rich in polyphenols flavonoids antoy so
[3496.96 - 3500.12] these are the greens the purples and all
[3498.36 - 3502.48] of that stuff are really good now I will
[3500.12 - 3504.92] share something with you I recently had
[3502.48 - 3508.16] a breast cancer lady and I told my dad
[3504.92 - 3510.84] give a resol resol is found in
[3508.16 - 3512.16] grapes and fortunately by the grace of
[3510.84 - 3513.72] God I have an amazing team and an
[3512.16 - 3515.52] amazing software so when we put
[3513.72 - 3519.04] everything together it came back there
[3515.52 - 3521.36] was a study that resol for estrogen
[3519.04 - 3523.68] positive women actually promotes breast
[3521.36 - 3526.08] tissue tumor
[3523.68 - 3528.16] growth so even celebrity nutritionist
[3526.08 - 3531.80] Ryan Fernando knows
[3528.16 - 3535.52] Fu it's like saying some
[3531.80 - 3538.84] guy stock market everyone is a Financial
[3535.52 - 3540.64] expert everyone is a nutritionist so
[3538.84 - 3543.04] when we come to medical conditions it's
[3540.64 - 3546.60] a case basis analysis where food is a
[3543.04 - 3549.56] therapeutic drug so in my interest to
[3546.60 - 3551.64] improve anti-aging recovery to this lady
[3549.56 - 3553.20] and because she was a marathon runner my
[3551.64 - 3555.12] first line of thought was high
[3553.20 - 3556.76] antioxidants which is the best guy asai
[3555.12 - 3559.04] Berry so asai Berry passed through but
[3556.76 - 3561.36] resol didn't pass through this is why
[3559.04 - 3564.08] people with cancer have to work with a
[3561.36 - 3566.52] medical dietician and not Wing It
[3564.08 - 3569.20] fortunately for me the latest doctors at
[3566.52 - 3571.52] Sloan in the Cancer Treatment Center of
[3569.20 - 3572.92] America are now all working with medical
[3571.52 - 3574.84] dietitians in India slowly they've
[3572.92 - 3576.04] started coming to us but the normal
[3574.84 - 3578.44] thing
[3576.04 - 3580.84] is do you know that most of your cancers
[3578.44 - 3582.76] have come because of your diet or your
[3580.84 - 3584.48] environment so food for thought that's
[3582.76 - 3586.92] why I say go organic reduce the chemical
[3584.48 - 3588.56] exposure uh reduce your stress breathe
[3586.92 - 3591.20] better take a chill
[3588.56 - 3592.56] pill thanks another one from our one of
[3591.20 - 3595.40] our colleague you know which actually
[3592.56 - 3596.84] inspire everyone in our office Ken Ken
[3595.40 - 3599.72] he said grow more
[3596.84 - 3601.48] mus yeah that's a resolution she has
[3599.72 - 3602.72] asked later a question What vitamin
[3601.48 - 3605.00] supplements are essential for
[3602.72 - 3606.28] vegetarians or women in their 20s 30s
[3605.00 - 3608.84] 40s and
[3606.28 - 3610.76] 50s so I built neutralite in India which
[3608.84 - 3613.52] is the largest food supplement brand I
[3610.76 - 3615.04] used to work for them and we would
[3613.52 - 3616.32] prescribe supplements to all
[3615.04 - 3619.08] Distributors take take take take take
[3616.32 - 3620.92] take take fast forward 25 years I now
[3619.08 - 3622.00] have my own nutrition clinic and I do
[3620.92 - 3624.72] the testing
[3622.00 - 3627.04] and you don't need a multivitamin unless
[3624.72 - 3629.60] you have a nutritional deficiency so
[3627.04 - 3632.08] step one do the Complete vitamin and
[3629.60 - 3634.80] mineral blood test once a year if money
[3632.08 - 3637.16] is not an issue do it twice a year if
[3634.80 - 3639.04] any vitamin or mineral is deficient pick
[3637.16 - 3641.20] up the phone call up Ryan Fernando I
[3639.04 - 3643.80] will help prescribe from my team what
[3641.20 - 3646.28] you should do for a food PL first assume
[3643.80 - 3649.32] you have low vitamin
[3646.28 - 3651.88] B9 pist 6 months lat a test has it gone
[3649.32 - 3654.60] up or take a standalone vitamin B9
[3651.88 - 3655.88] alternate T what doctors do they they
[3654.60 - 3657.92] give you a prescription for 30 days take
[3655.88 - 3659.76] for 30 days but do you have a genetic
[3657.92 - 3662.24] receptor that is not absorbing vitamin
[3659.76 - 3664.64] B9 and therefore you need a
[3662.24 - 3667.72] lifelong management of
[3664.64 - 3670.28] BB9 so a girl taking a vitamin or
[3667.72 - 3671.96] mineral actually is not a standardized
[3670.28 - 3673.72] practice in my opinion I come back to
[3671.96 - 3675.56] the bio individuality you are going to
[3673.72 - 3677.16] remember me 10 years later Ryan Fernando
[3675.56 - 3678.72] said bio individuality there is going to
[3677.16 - 3680.24] be an Apple iPhone bloody you put your
[3678.72 - 3682.60] finger on it it'll take out a blood
[3680.24 - 3684.24] sample and tell you sir G today ma'am G
[3682.60 - 3687.68] today you have low vitamin B9 please eat
[3684.24 - 3689.28] more of this bio individuality so taking
[3687.68 - 3691.16] a multivitamin if you want to take a
[3689.28 - 3693.24] multivitamin on your own prescription
[3691.16 - 3695.40] the safest thing I don't advise it but
[3693.24 - 3697.32] the safest way is do it twice a week
[3695.40 - 3699.64] Saturday Sunday take a multivitamin with
[3697.32 - 3701.12] your breakfast sir why should why don't
[3699.64 - 3703.12] I take seven days a week you could
[3701.12 - 3704.48] overdose your body is smart enough to
[3703.12 - 3706.20] know that this is a chemical is not
[3704.48 - 3708.12] coming from food so whenever you take a
[3706.20 - 3709.68] multivitamin take it with your food so
[3708.12 - 3712.28] that vitamin C and that zinc and all is
[3709.68 - 3713.32] like Hey by you ate nice baked beans no
[3712.28 - 3715.24] I'm going along with the baked beans
[3713.32 - 3718.08] into the body so that would be uh the
[3715.24 - 3719.56] thing uh am I anti supplement no I'm not
[3718.08 - 3722.16] anti supplement I'm actually Pro
[3719.56 - 3723.76] supplement but I'm not pro supplement
[3722.16 - 3725.56] when every person on the planet thinks
[3723.76 - 3726.76] that they are a nutritionist because
[3725.56 - 3728.16] then I can sit down and argue with you
[3726.76 - 3730.20] saying that you're actually harming your
[3728.16 - 3734.64] body we had this incident where this
[3730.20 - 3736.96] lady took ayurvedic um herbals and um so
[3734.64 - 3739.76] she came to us and her hemoglobin
[3736.96 - 3741.40] dropped in two three months it was 12.8
[3739.76 - 3742.76] then it dropped to 9.6 so I asked all
[3741.40 - 3744.64] the questions did you have Deni do you
[3742.76 - 3746.04] have malaria did you have so nothing
[3744.64 - 3748.08] nothing liver was showing very bad
[3746.04 - 3749.48] parameters like what are you taking she
[3748.08 - 3752.12] says no my aurvedic doctor gave me
[3749.48 - 3753.40] something I said go meet a hematologist
[3752.12 - 3755.24] and please tell him you have liver
[3753.40 - 3756.52] poisoning she didn't believe me she went
[3755.24 - 3758.52] to that guy that guy did some extra test
[3756.52 - 3759.68] on says they found out heavy lead
[3758.52 - 3762.84] content in
[3759.68 - 3764.92] her so she assumed that ashwag gandha
[3762.84 - 3766.44] very good for brain health safe now
[3764.92 - 3767.92] ashwag gandha is okay but the
[3766.44 - 3769.84] compounding of ashwag gandha by that
[3767.92 - 3771.20] ayurvedic manufacturer in traditional
[3769.84 - 3773.36] practice of a weather was to roll the
[3771.20 - 3775.60] medicine with heavy
[3773.36 - 3777.92] metals so when people say Do You Believe
[3775.60 - 3781.20] In Aura of course I believe in Aura the
[3777.92 - 3782.60] same way my grandfather rode a cycle I
[3781.20 - 3785.04] believe in riding a cycle but I also
[3782.60 - 3788.52] have a luxury vehicle let's advance to
[3785.04 - 3790.16] 2014 where prescription of nutrition
[3788.52 - 3792.40] prescription of superfoods prescription
[3790.16 - 3793.92] of supplements should be the main state
[3792.40 - 3795.56] so learn more about it and look at the
[3793.92 - 3797.60] end of the day stop experimenting with
[3795.56 - 3799.28] your body you have only one rolls rice
[3797.60 - 3800.96] this is like page driving rolls R gives
[3799.28 - 3802.52] him a brand manual says boss don't
[3800.96 - 3804.96] off-road this car on the Dubai desert
[3802.52 - 3806.44] huh page is like we drive this in the
[3804.96 - 3809.08] Dubai desert next day it takes to the
[3806.44 - 3810.96] mechanic sir left ball bearing is gone
[3809.08 - 3813.48] of the road right you went offroading
[3810.96 - 3815.72] you broke it you're born and he could
[3813.48 - 3817.00] buy another old rice then but what I'm
[3815.72 - 3819.36] trying to communicate to you is your
[3817.00 - 3821.84] body can't be changed so in the interest
[3819.36 - 3824.60] of not breaking your body in 20s 30s and
[3821.84 - 3826.00] 40s eat healthy eat organic do a blood
[3824.60 - 3829.16] test of vitamins and minerals if
[3826.00 - 3831.24] anything is low get in touch with Baba
[3829.16 - 3834.00] ran
[3831.24 - 3835.88] great one of attende has asked how to
[3834.00 - 3837.96] get some nutrition in when someone has
[3835.88 - 3840.48] eating disorder like recommendation of
[3837.96 - 3841.96] any food items so eating disorder is a
[3840.48 - 3844.24] psychological issue plaguing a lot of
[3841.96 - 3846.96] our teenage girls these days uh because
[3844.24 - 3848.28] of the image problems uh because and and
[3846.96 - 3850.08] just to share with all the parents in
[3848.28 - 3851.88] this group and all mostly with girls
[3850.08 - 3853.92] because they image conscious and even
[3851.88 - 3856.00] though their weight may be overweight or
[3853.92 - 3856.96] I have had girls who are 38 kgs thinking
[3856.00 - 3859.92] they are
[3856.96 - 3861.28] overweight so it is a psychological
[3859.92 - 3863.88] problem for which I work with a
[3861.28 - 3865.76] psychiatrist on my team number one so
[3863.88 - 3868.00] please please do not think you can
[3865.76 - 3870.52] self-help your child get medical
[3868.00 - 3871.92] Intervention number two no matter what
[3870.52 - 3874.04] you say which food is good or bad or
[3871.92 - 3876.80] ugly that child if they psychologically
[3874.04 - 3878.92] do not work on the mental part of
[3876.80 - 3880.80] anorexia or Bulma which are the medical
[3878.92 - 3883.00] conditions or the eating disorder
[3880.80 - 3884.36] conditions will never consume even what
[3883.00 - 3886.56] you say
[3884.36 - 3888.64] scientifically I've had a girl who used
[3886.56 - 3890.64] to come she used to drink one and a half
[3888.64 - 3892.16] lit of water before walking into my
[3890.64 - 3893.16] clinic this so that she'd weigh 1 and a
[3892.16 - 3895.04] half kg
[3893.16 - 3896.24] more
[3895.04 - 3898.04] and my team asked me sir how did you

[4032.84 - 4037.32] page I get very passionate about this
[4034.36 - 4038.72] topic because I see the future with
[4037.32 - 4040.40] people who are 70 who come to me and if
[4038.72 - 4041.64] I ask them what would you do if you went
[4040.40 - 4044.52] back when you're 25 the first thing
[4041.64 - 4047.40] people say take care of my health learn
[4044.52 - 4049.64] more in my job make more money when I'm
[4047.40 - 4051.68] younger because as I get older I don't
[4049.64 - 4053.12] have the health or bandwidth capacity to
[4051.68 - 4054.48] go to that level so these are small
[4053.12 - 4057.64] small things that I would say to
[4054.48 - 4060.08] everyone listening in today I agree the
[4057.64 - 4062.64] two last question one is from vij from
[4060.08 - 4064.08] Saudi Arabia vitamin D3 and B12
[4062.64 - 4065.60] deficiency is common issue with most
[4064.08 - 4068.56] veggies in
[4065.60 - 4071.48] Gulf so this is not only in Gulf this is
[4068.56 - 4073.12] the entire Indian genomic race has a
[4071.48 - 4075.24] vitamin B12 and D even I have a vitamin
[4073.12 - 4076.88] D deficiency so what I'm doing is I'm
[4075.24 - 4079.36] testing twice a year all my vitamins and
[4076.88 - 4081.16] minerals and I know after about six or
[4079.36 - 4083.92] seven testings that I have to take
[4081.16 - 4086.44] vitamin D twice a month 60,000 I to keep
[4083.92 - 4087.96] my levels at 40 to 50 don't try and be
[4086.44 - 4089.88] bottom of the class in your vitamin D
[4087.96 - 4092.52] and b12 levels don't try and be 218 in
[4089.88 - 4094.60] B12 and don't try and be 30 in vitamin D
[4092.52 - 4096.08] try and be at 50 levels 50 nanogram
[4094.60 - 4098.24] levels in vitamin D and try and be at
[4096.08 - 4100.04] around 300 to 400 all vegetarians will
[4098.24 - 4101.68] not get B12 in their diet you need to
[4100.04 - 4103.52] take a nutritional supplement for that
[4101.68 - 4106.64] take a sublingual which you put on your
[4103.52 - 4108.64] mouth it is called not methy cobalamine
[4106.64 - 4110.56] it's called it's not called cobalamine
[4108.64 - 4113.44] it's called methy cobalamine vitamin B12
[4110.56 - 4113.44] methy cobalamine
[4114.36 - 4119.84] level yeah we have one question from
[4116.84 - 4122.08] chel Individual resident in the pgs are
[4119.84 - 4123.32] able to prepare their own meels so what
[4122.08 - 4125.20] should they consume to maintain their
[4123.32 - 4127.08] health very very good question this is
[4125.20 - 4129.24] most of my team so what I tell them see
[4127.08 - 4131.40] pgs we get very very basic food very
[4129.24 - 4133.48] basic and that PG is like all restaurant
[4131.40 - 4136.08] owners they will not use olive oil and
[4133.48 - 4137.64] all they cheap daa cheap ration rice
[4136.08 - 4140.04] everything is cheap so first things
[4137.64 - 4142.44] first those who live in pgs when you
[4140.04 - 4143.64] order out don't order Biryani from a
[4142.44 - 4146.16] local chiper
[4143.64 - 4147.28] restaurant order a good healthy meal
[4146.16 - 4149.16] when you're eating out if it's three
[4147.28 - 4150.92] four times a week number one number two
[4149.16 - 4153.24] when you go to work stop at the local
[4150.92 - 4156.16] supermarket or order online from the
[4153.24 - 4158.44] organic stores carrot cucumber tomato
[4156.16 - 4159.80] keep it in a tiffen box carry it to work
[4158.44 - 4161.24] cut a carrot make friends with the
[4159.80 - 4162.88] housekeeping my housekeeping loves me
[4161.24 - 4166.16] every month I give her 500 rupees I'm
[4162.88 - 4168.48] like Mary every day 11:00 one guava so I
[4166.16 - 4170.60] pay for the guava I pay for the carrot
[4168.48 - 4171.92] and the Tomato but I pay her 500 Rupees
[4170.60 - 4175.08] to cut it specially for me and give it
[4171.92 - 4176.68] to me so all if you earn enough yeah pay
[4175.08 - 4179.04] the housekeeping domestic staff to get
[4176.68 - 4182.32] you that healthy cut salad cut fruit at
[4179.04 - 4184.64] your desk look at dry fruit ldo because
[4182.32 - 4186.80] of the thing or do what I used to do I
[4184.64 - 4188.60] used to keep some pistas and almonds and
[4186.80 - 4190.40] walnut and I used to pack it in Ziploc
[4188.60 - 4192.48] bags and make five of them and keep it
[4190.40 - 4194.04] in my office so every day I would eat
[4192.48 - 4195.60] pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds something
[4194.04 - 4197.96] so that's another way to get nutrition
[4195.60 - 4199.92] do a blood test vitamins and minerals if
[4197.96 - 4201.68] anything is low take a multivitamin
[4199.92 - 4204.12] twice a week for those of you who are
[4201.68 - 4206.52] skinny like me you could buy a protein
[4204.12 - 4208.44] shake without sweetener in it and mix it
[4206.52 - 4210.72] in an Armond or coconut milk or normal
[4208.44 - 4213.96] milk if you're not allergic to milk
[4210.72 - 4217.44] other point that you should do is once a
[4213.96 - 4219.60] week make sure that the one meal you
[4217.44 - 4221.48] cook yourself or go to a friend's house
[4219.60 - 4223.08] and cook and all the ladies and all the
[4221.48 - 4225.12] mothers if there are any women watching
[4223.08 - 4228.44] this seminar
[4225.12 - 4230.28] you have no idea the power of your touch
[4228.44 - 4232.12] research has shown that food water
[4230.28 - 4235.12] vibrates at a real frequency when I
[4232.12 - 4236.40] serve my kid I pray dear Lord bless this
[4235.12 - 4238.44] food I'm giving it to my son I didn't
[4236.40 - 4240.56] even prepare it but I'm praying to the
[4238.44 - 4243.00] angels and the creators of the universe
[4240.56 - 4244.60] and I'm saying make this food energetic
[4243.00 - 4246.76] today we can't measure it but mark my
[4244.60 - 4248.64] words in the next 100 years we will be
[4246.76 - 4251.08] able to measure the quantum energy
[4248.64 - 4253.28] signature coming off food who has grown
[4251.08 - 4255.68] it who has harvested it who has carried
[4253.28 - 4257.60] it who has sold it to you who has cut it
[4255.68 - 4259.56] who has prepared it and who has served
[4257.60 - 4261.36] it to you all of this will add to the
[4259.56 - 4263.60] energy coming to and if you don't know
[4261.36 - 4266.64] anything of this before you eat ladies
[4263.60 - 4269.60] and gentlemen do what I
[4266.64 - 4271.48] do I pray over my food for 10 seconds

[4293.96 - 4298.20] my brain thank you start
[4295.88 - 4300.00] eating it's very important this is one
[4298.20 - 4301.24] way PG people can change the energy
[4300.00 - 4303.56] signature of your food I know I sound
[4301.24 - 4305.20] like a quack Guru or something that you
[4303.56 - 4306.60] have nothing lose to lose to just try
[4305.20 - 4308.88] this
[4306.60 - 4312.12] out next we have one interesting
[4308.88 - 4314.08] question like how to avoid the mlight
[4312.12 - 4316.04] Cravings if you have have midnight
[4314.08 - 4318.84] Cravings most likely your B12 and
[4316.04 - 4320.96] vitamin D and hemoglobin is low so when
[4318.84 - 4325.28] people have midnight Cravings Cravings
[4320.96 - 4325.28] is the human evolution of the
[4328.60 - 4334.16] body come here so it's most likely you
[4331.80 - 4338.20] have a vitamin or mineral deficiency so
[4334.16 - 4340.72] what I would do is I would add soda
[4338.20 - 4343.08] sparkling water with electrolytes or
[4340.72 - 4345.08] salt in it with lemon in it in the
[4343.08 - 4347.04] evenings I would take a magnesium
[4345.08 - 4349.48] supplement at night I would drink
[4347.04 - 4353.20] chamomile tea and then eat two large
[4349.48 - 4355.28] pieces or half a credit size of 100%
[4353.20 - 4357.72] dark cocoa
[4355.28 - 4359.24] chocolate and tell me in 3 months if
[4357.72 - 4361.64] your sugar Cravings do not disappear if
[4359.24 - 4363.32] they do not disappear you have a insulin
[4361.64 - 4365.44] problem or sugar problem and you're
[4363.32 - 4368.28] moving towards diabetes so then you need
[4365.44 - 4370.08] to do an hba1c blood test a fasting
[4368.28 - 4371.88] glucose blood test or homas score and an
[4370.08 - 4373.32] insulin fasting level when I look at all
[4371.88 - 4374.44] of this I will tell you if you're moving
[4373.32 - 4376.36] in in the direction of becoming a
[4374.44 - 4378.52] diabetic and we can see it a decade in
[4376.36 - 4379.68] advance I can see it 10 years in advance
[4378.52 - 4381.00] that you're going to become a diabetic
[4379.68 - 4382.64] with the blood test so then I tell you
[4381.00 - 4385.08] this information then you're like okay
[4382.64 - 4387.24] pastry at night no Ryan said eat two
[4385.08 - 4388.88] pistas two walnuts two wenss just eat
[4387.24 - 4390.00] that drink water go to sleep and you
[4388.88 - 4391.88] have midnight Cravings because you're
[4390.00 - 4393.12] not supposed to be awake at midnight
[4391.88 - 4394.64] you're supposed to go to sleep at 8:00
[4393.12 - 4396.56] at night no no sir how you can go to
[4394.64 - 4398.52] sleep we created electricity you know
[4396.56 - 4400.24] but evolution was last 200,000 years in
[4398.52 - 4401.92] homo sapian but electricity is only last
[4400.24 - 4403.00] 100 years our grandmothers and
[4401.92 - 4404.32] grandfathers created so many children
[4403.00 - 4406.16] because they have no Netflix no they to
[4404.32 - 4407.08] entertain each other so by the time the
[4406.16 - 4408.04] sun went down what you do put the
[4407.08 - 4411.00] children to sleep and then you banged
[4408.04 - 4413.72] each other think about it we should be
[4411.00 - 4415.44] bed in bed by 10:00 please everyone go
[4413.72 - 4416.84] to sleep early stop watching Netflix
[4415.44 - 4418.52] Netflix is controllable you could watch
[4416.84 - 4421.12] it early morning on your way to
[4418.52 - 4422.80] work right U I'll just take up two more
[4421.12 - 4424.64] questions one posted by pun but just
[4422.80 - 4426.16] before that uh this is a query by most
[4424.64 - 4428.04] of the women out there and we've
[4426.16 - 4429.60] received this as a question uh you know
[4428.04 - 4431.36] while we were doing these registrations
[4429.60 - 4433.36] during my periods of menstrual cycle I
[4431.36 - 4435.00] experienced vomiting and food doesn't
[4433.36 - 4436.00] digest well what should be the ideal
[4435.00 - 4438.44] food to
[4436.00 - 4439.84] eat I've had this condition before where
[4438.44 - 4441.20] women don't feel like eating during
[4439.84 - 4444.60] their menstration and this comes from
[4441.20 - 4445.72] Evolution a lot of women see women there
[4444.60 - 4447.08] are different types of women okay women
[4445.72 - 4449.48] are created for birthing a lot of
[4447.08 - 4451.16] children women are there to take care of
[4449.48 - 4452.96] the birth of children but do not produce
[4451.16 - 4455.24] children and there are women who are
[4452.96 - 4457.16] warriors so and this is evolution point
[4455.24 - 4459.16] of view so what I believe is that when a
[4457.16 - 4461.36] person cannot eat there are underlining
[4459.16 - 4463.56] conditions of maybe pcod or thyroid so
[4461.36 - 4465.60] there is a hormonal fluctuation and it
[4463.56 - 4467.76] affects the gut microbiome the bacteria
[4465.60 - 4469.48] in the gut who say stop don't give me
[4467.76 - 4473.40] anything I don't want to digest any food
[4469.48 - 4475.08] now in such a condition we rechange the
[4473.40 - 4477.12] entire weight of a woman over a
[4475.08 - 4479.12] six-month one-year period how she eats
[4477.12 - 4482.12] for nutritional deficiencies magnesium
[4479.12 - 4485.24] deficiency iodine deficiency thyroid
[4482.12 - 4487.96] deficiency then we put in foods like red
[4485.24 - 4489.52] clover tea give her a vitamin E Avon
[4487.96 - 4492.20] during the 5 days before the start of a
[4489.52 - 4493.96] menstration cycle shift over to foods
[4492.20 - 4498.20] like in AA which we call call as low
[4493.96 - 4499.44] heat Foods cucumber micro greens a salad
[4498.20 - 4502.32] maybe a little bit of curd rice
[4499.44 - 4504.56] pomegranate and rice not heavy food and
[4502.32 - 4506.72] as I said before a human lady if she's
[4504.56 - 4508.48] not planning to have a pregnancy can go
[4506.72 - 4510.48] three days without food just have
[4508.48 - 4512.68] electrolytes and water and put some
[4510.48 - 4514.48] amount of food to prevent acidity burn
[4512.68 - 4515.96] could be a banana could be a guava so
[4514.48 - 4517.84] you can even have fruits during the you
[4515.96 - 4519.08] don't need to do Dal chavel roty because
[4517.84 - 4520.40] your ancestors thought you eat Dal CH
[4519.08 - 4522.76] rotti at breakfast lunch
[4520.40 - 4525.80] dinner the only issue comes is the woman
[4522.76 - 4527.72] is any IC has low fertin and has low
[4525.80 - 4529.88] body weight then this advice that I just
[4527.72 - 4532.64] gave is defunct then I would request
[4529.88 - 4534.48] this said person to meet a medical
[4532.64 - 4537.44] dietitian who works on what we call as
[4534.48 - 4539.24] menstration cycle issues and try and
[4537.44 - 4540.84] figure out what is the best eating
[4539.24 - 4542.72] pattern what is the best superfood
[4540.84 - 4544.16] pattern and what is the best uh
[4542.72 - 4545.72] supplements that they G in fact there's
[4544.16 - 4547.04] something known as seed cycling there
[4545.72 - 4548.68] are certain dry fruits and seeds that
[4547.04 - 4550.00] are given in the first 14 days of the
[4548.68 - 4551.64] menstruation cycle and the certain type
[4550.00 - 4553.04] of Drive fruits are eat in the next 14
[4551.64 - 4555.20] days of the menstruation cycle it's
[4553.04 - 4556.40] called seed cycling for menstration you
[4555.20 - 4557.88] can Google this up it's actively
[4556.40 - 4559.40] available on the internet and you can do
[4557.88 - 4561.36] your own jard but if money is not an
[4559.40 - 4563.48] issue please hire a dietitian and work
[4561.36 - 4565.80] with the dietician like a financial
[4563.48 - 4567.56] adviser last question and I apologize
[4565.80 - 4570.28] that we we posy of time and we don't
[4567.56 - 4571.80] want R to be holding back for so you can
[4570.28 - 4573.80] of course email your questions I've sent
[4571.80 - 4575.56] the IDS where you can email uh the last
[4573.80 - 4577.80] question for the evening is from Saudi
[4575.56 - 4579.80] Arabia Mr Chandra Shar and J raan has
[4577.80 - 4581.44] asked how to avoid thyroid uh through
[4579.80 - 4583.68] food habits for a person who is age of
[4581.44 - 4586.00] 25 so first of all if a person has
[4583.68 - 4587.76] thyroid at the age of 25 the TSH which
[4586.00 - 4590.00] is the thyroid stimulating hormone is
[4587.76 - 4592.00] dependent on 10 nutritive molecules
[4590.00 - 4594.92] which is inclusive of protein vitamin
[4592.00 - 4596.64] B12 vitamin C magnesium selenium
[4594.92 - 4599.20] chromium zinc and a host of other things
[4596.64 - 4601.28] I can't remember all 10 so when you eat
[4599.20 - 4604.84] correctly this goes to the pitutary and
[4601.28 - 4606.84] says Hey by TSH B now when there's a
[4604.84 - 4609.72] nutritional deficient
[4606.84 - 4611.04] TSH so thyroid like boy thyroid
[4609.72 - 4612.08] stimulating hormone come stimulate me
[4611.04 - 4613.84] produce
[4612.08 - 4615.64] thyroid
[4613.84 - 4617.56] nutrition I'm not talking about being
[4615.64 - 4619.00] gundu or fat or muscle no no no I'm
[4617.56 - 4620.56] talking about micronutrition so the
[4619.00 - 4623.04] first things first is to look at the
[4620.56 - 4625.20] micronutrition blood test second is to
[4623.04 - 4628.52] look if this person has a family history
[4625.20 - 4630.92] of thyroid problem where thyroid can be
[4628.52 - 4632.16] genetically also having an issue and I
[4630.92 - 4634.48] had many cases where I have to take
[4632.16 - 4636.68] people of milk and gluten and the
[4634.48 - 4639.28] thyroid has improved so look at removing
[4636.68 - 4642.04] gluten from wheat Bley and dry look at
[4639.28 - 4644.40] removing lactose or milk for a period of
[4642.04 - 4646.40] 6 months improve your nutrition take a
[4644.40 - 4648.36] multivitamin twice a week after doing a
[4646.40 - 4650.24] blood test meet a nutrition or dietician
[4648.36 - 4651.84] this should work in terms of the foods
[4650.24 - 4653.16] that slap the thyroid in the old school
[4651.84 - 4655.08] we had something known as goitrogenic
[4653.16 - 4658.76] foods which are foods like cauliflower
[4655.08 - 4660.76] strawberri spinach uh ragi which or or
[4658.76 - 4663.36] millets which did not agree with the
[4660.76 - 4665.04] thyroid and hence they are avoided so
[4663.36 - 4667.60] please meet with a dietitian at Quan
[4665.04 - 4669.84] nutrition clinics it it cost 16,500
[4667.60 - 4671.88] rupees for a three-month plan uh at the
[4669.84 - 4673.60] Quan nutrition clinics you can do all of
[4671.88 - 4675.52] these things and blood test and then get
[4673.60 - 4677.80] a new diet plan every month and then
[4675.52 - 4680.16] experiment with that and and hopefully
[4677.80 - 4682.00] at the age of 25 we can actually reverse
[4680.16 - 4684.60] any thyroid issues because people should
[4682.00 - 4686.32] get thyroid only at 50 or 60 not at 25
[4684.60 - 4689.48] if it's at 25 there's there's a
[4686.32 - 4691.88] nutritional deficiency diet
[4689.48 - 4693.08] problem right uh thank you Ryan that was
[4691.88 - 4695.20] that was really interesting thank you
[4693.08 - 4697.20] for all the tips and I I can tell you
[4695.20 - 4698.92] Ryan from last year's time we we did
[4697.20 - 4701.80] have our office flooded with camomile
[4698.92 - 4703.16] tea uh just after your webinar and uh I
[4701.80 - 4706.52] you know that's that's something that we
[4703.16 - 4708.20] did as as as a practice you know himaki
[4706.52 - 4709.44] the thing is there are all gurus and
[4708.20 - 4712.96] experts out
[4709.44 - 4714.60] there but going from the level of
[4712.96 - 4717.48] knowledge awareness or spiritual
[4714.60 - 4719.76] following to practicing it in daily life
[4717.48 - 4721.84] requires Community effort so I'm really
[4719.76 - 4723.76] happy that it started in your offices
[4721.84 - 4727.40] and places and this financial Community
[4723.76 - 4729.68] because um look at running in some parts
[4727.40 - 4731.28] of the world it's literally a craze
[4729.68 - 4734.32] right so if you go to like Amsterdam and
[4731.28 - 4736.44] all everyone Cycles everyone walks right
[4734.32 - 4739.08] it is a community
[4736.44 - 4741.04] ideology so I believe that the financial
[4739.08 - 4743.72] guys are some of the most astute
[4741.04 - 4746.28] Visionaries actuaries they're able to
[4743.72 - 4748.92] see Based on data so if you as a team if
[4746.28 - 4750.36] you as a team start with 10 15 people 20
[4748.92 - 4753.48] people it creates a moment I've been
[4750.36 - 4755.20] doing this for 15 years and maybe I have
[4753.48 - 4757.20] a fan fan following of about one lakh
[4755.20 - 4758.72] people but the thought process himan is
[4757.20 - 4760.60] if he can get camomile te in the office
[4758.72 - 4762.96] if he can get 10,000 steps if you can do
[4760.60 - 4765.08] all of these small small things changes
[4762.96 - 4767.72] diet plan comes secondary exercise plan
[4765.08 - 4770.16] comes secondary first make these
[4767.72 - 4772.00] changes right and and we also did the
[4770.16 - 4773.60] implementation I think for the last six
[4772.00 - 4776.08] months in office everybody walks after
[4773.60 - 4778.24] lunch and we do uh you know few steps
[4776.08 - 4780.04] that we that we definitely do uh we also
[4778.24 - 4781.44] have small small competitions going on
[4780.04 - 4783.04] amongst the team members about how many
[4781.44 - 4784.52] steps each one did did for a particular
[4783.04 - 4786.60] day so that's something that keeps us
