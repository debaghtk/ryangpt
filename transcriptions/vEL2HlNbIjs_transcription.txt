Note :
Proper storage and thorough reheating of cooked rice is important to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and mycotoxins that can cause food poisoning. Refrigeration should be done within an hour of cooking, and reheating should be thorough to ensure any bacteria are killed off. However, there is still a risk of foodborne illness, so it is best to follow food safety guidelines when handling and consuming rice.
