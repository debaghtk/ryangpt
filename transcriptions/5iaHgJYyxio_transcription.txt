Title: Doctors reveal the major health risks people have in India

Description: Genetic testing is revolutionizing corporate healthcare by offering personalized insights into employees' genetic predispositions for various health conditions. By analyzing an individual's DNA, genetic tests can identify potential risks for diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and more. Employers can utilize this information to tailor wellness programs and interventions to meet the specific needs of their workforce, ultimately improving employee health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs in the long run. Additionally, genetic testing empowers individuals to take proactive measures towards managing their health, leading to a more engaged and productive workforce. However, it's crucial for employers to prioritize privacy and ethical considerations when implementing genetic testing programs, ensuring that employees' genetic data is protected and used responsibly. Collaborating with qualified genetic counselors and healthcare professionals can help companies navigate the complexities of genetic testing and integrate it effectively into their corporate healthcare strategies.

[0.08 - 4.72] hey guys if you're not able to watch my
[2.28 - 6.88] long form content of podcast here are
[4.72 - 8.68] some short form clips for you to enjoy
[6.88 - 10.44] recently I was working in one of the
[8.68 - 12.88] Fortune 500 companies and they
[10.44 - 15.76] contracted us to do the nutrition plans
[12.88 - 18.40] for people and we just asked for a basic
[15.76 - 21.48] blood test of the 20 to 30 year olds and
[18.40 - 24.76] we found that more than 67% of the blood
[21.48 - 27.40] test that we did had very high liid
[24.76 - 29.76] profiles yes yes and the the the
[27.40 - 31.44] youngsters were shocked yeah yeah so
[29.76 - 34.12] that's also part of our genetics as
[31.44 - 38.56] South Asian population where we are more
[34.12 - 40.72] prone to higher cholesterol you know
[38.56 - 43.96] what could be some of the modern day
[40.72 - 46.28] reasons that the 20s to 30s and 30s to
[43.96 - 50.12] 40s are facing these current lifestyle
[46.28 - 53.28] diseases what from the air or from the
[50.12 - 55.20] water or from the food or or is it my
[53.28 - 58.24] Kuma Bui or something that is causing
[55.20 - 60.56] this so as doctors screening thousands
[58.24 - 62.68] of people you are seeing statistics
[60.56 - 64.44] so you obviously are like Sherlock
[62.68 - 66.84] Holmes and you'll have an inference what
[64.44 - 68.68] are the modern day conveniences that are
[66.84 - 71.80] putting a Target on
[68.68 - 74.12] people one I think to add to Dr satya's
[71.80 - 76.68] Point genetically we are predisposed to
[74.12 - 78.28] more coronary arteries cardio I can
[76.68 - 80.24] blame my grandfather grandmother but
[78.28 - 83.36] only that's part of the story uh genetic
[80.24 - 86.16] screening results have shown us that
[83.36 - 87.48] that predisposition causes only 1/4 of
[86.16 - 89.48] the contribution to the overall inness
[87.48 - 92.16] of the person the others are you know
[89.48 - 94.80] your life style like so 25% I can blame
[92.16 - 97.00] my ancestry ancestors for that and 75%
[94.80 - 99.84] is my mine which is your you know
[97.00 - 102.48] dietary intake your sedentary lifestyle
[99.84 - 103.84] pollution in there you know uh and the
[102.48 - 106.32] kind of food that I'm eating and of
[103.84 - 108.88] course while we may be aware about our
[106.32 - 111.68] you know Health needs but we are not
[108.88 - 113.96] really uh you know doing much about it
[111.68 - 116.44] uh like we see we are you know more
[113.96 - 118.48] leading a lot of sedentary um lifestyle
[116.44 - 121.12] choices um I think those are
[118.48 - 124.00] contributory factors also Indians
[121.12 - 125.00] genetically are insulin resistant more
[124.00 - 127.88] than
[125.00 - 129.76] Caucasians that leads to you know High
[127.88 - 131.96] predisposition for diabetes and of
[129.76 - 134.08] course uh you know resulting impact on
[131.96 - 135.40] other other organs as well so that I
[134.08 - 137.40] think something we really have to watch
[135.40 - 139.40] out for so Dr Manish what I'm hearing
[137.40 - 142.44] and what all our fans are listening in
[139.40 - 144.00] is that okay at 25% I can blame my
[142.44 - 145.76] family genes I still want to blame my
[144.00 - 147.96] family maybe for my diabetes
[145.76 - 152.88] hypertension GATRA Yeo all of those
[147.96 - 156.12] things right but as a young adult should
[152.88 - 159.12] I screen when should I screen and what
[156.12 - 162.24] should I screen for for this blaming my
[159.12 - 165.16] family part out let's call it
[162.24 - 167.12] genetics so um because I think if I know
[165.16 - 170.56] that I'm going to have something that
[167.12 - 174.08] has a risk factor I'm hoping we smart
[170.56 - 177.00] enough to say that I inherited it but I
[174.08 - 179.92] won't activate it so what could we be
[177.00 - 181.60] doing uh as tests so Ryan I'm going to
[179.92 - 183.96] share a personal anecdote here I
[181.60 - 187.08] actually did my own genetic
[183.96 - 190.28] sequencing and uh some of the results
[187.08 - 193.76] that um actually stood out for me and
[190.28 - 197.76] made me change my behaviors
[193.76 - 200.00] right um first I realized that I had um
[197.76 - 202.84] higher likelihood of developing
[200.00 - 204.24] hypertension which is blood pressure so
[202.84 - 207.68] that's something that I realized as part
[204.24 - 210.40] of my genetic profile I therefore now
[207.68 - 211.40] regularly take my blood pressure
[210.40 - 213.60] every
[211.40 - 216.72] week now it also helps that I'm in a
[213.60 - 219.44] hypertensive household and everyone goes
[216.72 - 222.60] around passes the BP meter and uh we now
[219.44 - 225.12] make it a ritual I knock onward don't
[222.60 - 227.48] have it yet but because that genetic
[225.12 - 230.80] sequencing result told me that I'm at a
[227.48 - 232.92] higher risk than the average Indian I
[230.80 - 235.96] now do this regularly I'm hoping that I
[232.92 - 238.48] can catch any Rising Trend so not at any
[235.96 - 240.40] given one point but a rising Trend that
[238.48 - 243.60] then allows me to
[240.40 - 246.08] um address it well before it becomes a
[243.60 - 248.88] problem so you did the testing know that
[246.08 - 251.04] you have a hypertensive kind of Gene and
[248.88 - 253.16] you're now screening with a BP monitor
[251.04 - 255.56] so you're you're doing it proactively
[253.16 - 258.08] are you changing anything in your life
[255.56 - 261.40] so let me give you an example of another
[258.08 - 265.40] Gene that uh was identified where
[261.40 - 270.24] apparently I have a tendency to add more
[265.40 - 274.20] weight with high fat foods ah the minute
[270.24 - 277.88] I saw that I had a red or higher than
[274.20 - 279.68] the average Indian it's automatically
[277.88 - 282.08] made it somewhat tangible for my brain
[279.68 - 285.12] to process this as something that's not
[282.08 - 287.32] good for me and since then I have been
[285.12 - 289.84] watchful so when Dr Satya sees the
[287.32 - 292.12] Samosa on her plate she's like you're
[289.84 - 296.40] not worthy to enter my body right now I
[292.12 - 300.00] actually ask am I allowed to enjoy that
[296.40 - 301.88] this week so let me rewind slightly with
[300.00 - 303.88] you because I want our listeners to
[301.88 - 306.00] understand that you're a CEO of AP poloo
[303.88 - 307.92] preventive Healthcare and you're making
[306.00 - 310.44] changes because you've understood the
[307.92 - 314.04] crystal ball gazing into your future
[310.44 - 317.40] which is if you were younger did you eat
[314.04 - 320.36] a samosa with abandon and now with this
[317.40 - 322.20] knowledge is it making you realize that
[320.36 - 325.56] your body is the most expensive real
[322.20 - 328.16] estate it's not changeable and therefore
[325.56 - 329.92] you have to make some changes is is
[328.16 - 332.00] there a difference between the Young
[329.92 - 334.36] version of you and now the more wiser
[332.00 - 338.28] older version of you absolutely I
[334.36 - 343.20] actually developed kidney stones oh very
[338.28 - 346.00] young okay and uh that was a wakeup call
[343.20 - 348.28] for everyone has a wake up call at some
[346.00 - 350.64] point in their life and now in my 40s
[348.28 - 355.32] the number of things I know I really
[350.64 - 358.48] wish someone had uh slapped me awake in
[355.32 - 360.24] my 20s and told me the few things that I
[358.48 - 363.40] needed to change
[360.24 - 366.20] uh so that I could enjoy these um
[363.40 - 369.08] unscrupulous behaviors every now and
[366.20 - 371.40] then and you know I think that brings us
[369.08 - 373.00] to the point that 20 years back we we
[371.40 - 374.60] didn't have the luxury of genetic
[373.00 - 377.80] testing
[374.60 - 380.60] today's 20 and 30 year olds have that
[377.80 - 382.48] luxury and they must use this because
[380.60 - 384.44] it's very important to get that tested
[382.48 - 386.68] in the early years once the disease
[384.44 - 389.08] onset happens you know then you can only
[386.68 - 390.76] reverse the disease but if you get the
[389.08 - 392.56] testing done in time you can actually
[390.76 - 395.76] prevent the onset of diseases you know I
[392.56 - 397.60] so much agree with both of you um when
[395.76 - 399.72] we studied in our younger years we
[397.60 - 401.68] didn't have the access to the internet
[399.72 - 405.04] today's generations have technology
[401.68 - 406.16] right much smarter generation like um
[405.04 - 407.36] you know if you have a laptop that's
[406.16 - 410.12] running only at
[407.36 - 413.04] 60% you upgrade it to a new laptop that
[410.12 - 414.64] runs at 120% so I think this younger
[413.04 - 417.00] generation quite smart and once they
[414.64 - 419.68] begin to realize that I can have a
[417.00 - 422.32] crystal ball gazing into my Rams
[419.68 - 424.88] processing speed or what back foot do I
[422.32 - 427.04] have in my body so I also did my Gene
[424.88 - 429.48] testing and I discovered that I'm gluten
[427.04 - 431.80] intolerant mhm I wrote a whole book
[429.48 - 434.36] about it called wheatless why because
[431.80 - 437.96] when I was a teenager nobody told me
[434.36 - 442.40] that I should avoid milk and gluten and
[437.96 - 445.48] so I got acne hammering me late into my
[442.40 - 447.60] 30s and when I did a Cham test that to
[445.48 - 449.60] which was sent to America many many
[447.60 - 452.80] years ago the guy called up from there
[449.60 - 452.80] was speaking Hindi and they said
[453.72 - 459.00] by so you can't eat bread who told you
[456.84 - 462.44] to eat bread but who's going to tell me
[459.00 - 464.80] culturally that my dad Ma and my my
[462.44 - 468.84] grandfather were at two strong different
[464.80 - 470.80] locations so we're done blaming our
[468.84 - 474.12] genetics and our parents and our
[470.80 - 476.92] grandparents but um if you look at
[474.12 - 479.32] statistics from the medical
[476.92 - 482.64] industry and I'm sitting on this side of
[479.32 - 484.76] the lens what are the lifestyle diseases
[482.64 - 486.28] statistically that as an Indian I should
[484.76 - 488.84] be looking at
[486.28 - 491.52] for so which is the which is the top
[488.84 - 493.48] Gunda top Gunda I would say preo the top
[491.52 - 495.68] Gunda was you know the cardiovascular
[493.48 - 498.24] diseases so cardiovascular for the lay
[495.68 - 502.40] man it's hypertension coronary artery
[498.24 - 503.76] diseases you know um blockages artery
[502.40 - 505.68] blockages basically everything to do
[503.76 - 508.32] with the heart pumping of the heart that
[505.68 - 510.92] was the most common postco we've seen a
[508.32 - 514.56] massive shift towards cancer caner lung
[510.92 - 518.00] cancer liver cancer um stomach cancer
[514.56 - 519.76] among males and in females breast cancer
[518.00 - 522.00] cervical cancer and then lung cancer in
[519.76 - 524.84] that order so that's what we see most
[522.00 - 526.56] prevalence of but also mental health so
[524.84 - 527.80] what is the age group of people that
[526.56 - 530.88] come in for the preventive Health
[527.80 - 535.12] checkups like broad picture as young as
[530.88 - 537.60] what and as old as young as 25 as old as
[535.12 - 539.52] I mean there's no so 25 year old is
[537.60 - 541.08] listening in they can actually make the
[539.52 - 543.88] effort to come in and get screened and
[541.08 - 546.52] tested and everything absolutely I think
[543.88 - 549.40] as a habit we have to incorporate that
[546.52 - 551.12] early on and as you rightly said at you
[549.40 - 552.68] know in the early part of the show we
[551.12 - 554.68] shouldn't really wait for something to
[552.68 - 556.24] happen to us before we take that test I
[554.68 - 558.48] mean just think about it we get a car
[556.24 - 561.12] service twice a year four times a year
[558.48 - 563.12] but I know of many adults with strong
[561.12 - 565.56] family history not getting themselves
[563.12 - 566.92] tested for you know years together which
[565.56 - 570.28] is I think an extremely dangerous state
[566.92 - 572.68] to live in you know this is just popping
[570.28 - 575.32] up in my head which is we get so many
[572.68 - 579.32] people saying that right I do not want
[575.32 - 582.08] to know as a medical doctor I mean you
[579.32 - 583.80] guys will see the worst of the worst
[582.08 - 585.72] right and now you're sitting on the side
[583.80 - 587.32] of the fence where you're saying if I
[585.72 - 589.76] throw a ball I know where it's going to
[587.32 - 591.40] land yeah and this person saying I don't
[589.76 - 594.48] want to know where it's going to land
[591.40 - 596.40] yes what what do we say to such people
[594.48 - 597.92] who are sitting in the fence saying I
[596.40 - 600.12] don't want to know I want to enjoy my
[597.92 - 602.64] life but then they're hurting the whole
[600.12 - 605.04] family after that exactly the same thing
[602.64 - 606.92] I'm saying just think about the impact
[605.04 - 608.60] and the consequences that
[606.92 - 610.52] procrastination is going to have on your
[608.60 - 612.64] family to me that was the biggest wakeup
[610.52 - 614.32] call many many years back when I started
[612.64 - 615.64] regularly doing these health checks
[614.32 - 617.72] because you just have one life and
[615.64 - 619.20] nothing is going to substitute that you
[617.72 - 621.16] can't be replaced you know for your
[619.20 - 622.64] family and all there's no replacement so
[621.16 - 624.80] just think about that you know think
[622.64 - 626.76] about your parents I know so many young
[624.80 - 629.12] young men and women who lost their lives
[626.76 - 631.92] and today I see their parents really I
[629.12 - 634.68] mean not having that closure not you
[631.92 - 636.52] know having nobody for support I think
[634.68 - 638.52] that's a very sad state to be in for the
[636.52 - 640.08] family I think in addition to the loss
[638.52 - 643.76] of life it's also the additional
[640.08 - 647.32] economic burden on the family so when we
[643.76 - 650.96] diagnose something very late there may
[647.32 - 653.04] still be treatments available and you
[650.96 - 656.84] and your family want to give everything
[653.04 - 659.76] a short before uh saying this is it
[656.84 - 663.48] we've tried everything and that costs a
[659.76 - 665.56] lot of money lot of stress so in
[663.48 - 668.24] addition to you know God forbid the loss
[665.56 - 671.24] of life it's also this additional
[668.24 - 673.28] economic and uh stress burden that
[671.24 - 675.00] you're adding to the people around you
[673.28 - 677.08] is it true doctor because I was reading
[675.00 - 678.44] about these blue zones um around the
[677.08 - 681.92] world where people live into the
[678.44 - 684.04] hundreds and Japan is one of those areas
[681.92 - 686.28] and apparently Japan started the system
[684.04 - 689.04] of screening early catching diseases
[686.28 - 691.40] early so you know we we pride ourselves
[689.04 - 693.84] at ayura and the ancient text and all of
[691.40 - 697.56] that stuff but we're living so modern
[693.84 - 700.56] today what is it that we need to do or
[697.56 - 704.00] what does the population need to do in
[700.56 - 705.44] terms of lowering their medical cost
[704.00 - 708.76] what are the some of the small things
[705.44 - 710.88] that they could start doing I think uh
[708.76 - 715.16] what's in each of our hands is I'm going
[710.88 - 718.44] to say first um really evaluate your
[715.16 - 720.64] lifestyle habits and these are around
[718.44 - 725.76] what you consume consume right and
[720.64 - 728.64] that's a diet food uh water how much
[725.76 - 732.68] alcohol drugs so everything you
[728.64 - 735.76] consume second is how much you move so
[732.68 - 736.64] it's not just about Fitness strength
[735.76 - 739.00] that's
[736.64 - 742.20] important it's also about how much you
[739.00 - 745.24] keep moving through the day climb the
[742.20 - 747.84] stairs versus taking the elevator walk
[745.24 - 751.08] to get your coffee versus expecting it
[747.84 - 753.60] to show up at your desk take a walking
[751.08 - 756.32] meeting with somebody or a standing
[753.60 - 761.04] meeting with a group of people rather
[756.32 - 764.40] than continuously sitting the third is
[761.04 - 767.52] sleep sleep enough but also watch the
[764.40 - 770.08] quality of your sleep to make sure that
[767.52 - 771.52] it is restful for you because that's
[770.08 - 774.00] when your body actually
[771.52 - 775.88] rejuvenates um and your brain has enough
[774.00 - 779.20] time to process everything that it's col
[775.88 - 780.68] collated through the day the fourth is
[779.20 - 784.20] Stress
[780.68 - 786.96] Management the problem with stress is
[784.20 - 790.12] that the levels of cortisol and
[786.96 - 792.80] adrenaline hormones that go
[790.12 - 796.00] up it's actually a good thing when it is
[792.80 - 797.76] in very short bursts and helps us focus
[796.00 - 800.76] and be attentive and actually perform
[797.76 - 802.68] much better when it is sustained over a
[800.76 - 806.04] long period of time that's called
[802.68 - 807.36] chronic stress then the body doesn't
[806.04 - 809.16] even have chance to get it back to
[807.36 - 811.24] normal levels and that triggers a whole
[809.16 - 813.24] whole bunch of Downstream Pathways in
[811.24 - 815.92] your body causing everything from
[813.24 - 819.12] indigestion to diabetes cardiovascular
[815.92 - 820.88] issues and so forth and the last piece
[819.12 - 823.44] is actually a
[820.88 - 827.32] community people that you actually
[823.44 - 832.00] mindfully engage with in different parts
[827.32 - 833.84] of your life so this you know balance
[832.00 - 836.72] across different aspect of your
[833.84 - 841.04] lifestyle is I think what we have in our
[836.72 - 842.64] own hands and can do
[841.04 - 845.08] in addition to this I think there is
[842.64 - 848.36] screening right Manish absolutely I
[845.08 - 850.64] think screening and Screen Time make
[848.36 - 853.52] screening an annual ritual for for
[850.64 - 855.80] yourself and not just yourself the whole
[853.52 - 857.12] family I think because you know ill
[855.80 - 860.88] health affects the whole family that's
[857.12 - 862.92] one and you know screen time you know
[860.88 - 865.12] please cut down on that and last but not
[862.92 - 866.96] the least and it's an important Point
[865.12 - 870.00] what she alluded to is build meaningful
[866.96 - 872.44] relationships today I feel feel that
[870.00 - 876.12] taking a backseat a lot of time you
[872.44 - 878.12] know the the diet the moving and the
[876.12 - 880.40] sleep I think a lot of people are doing
[878.12 - 882.56] that even in today's generation but this
[880.40 - 884.60] relationship with Community you sit on a
[882.56 - 886.88] bus you sit on a train you sit on a
