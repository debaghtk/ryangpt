I'm going to react to these videos as a health coach and I will tell you first thing we frying it no problem we put some Masala in there turmeric powder very good anti-inflammatory Smash Potatoes oh you smash the potatoes and then put it inside very good potato smash white bread for children let us use um high fiber bread whole wheat bread and if your child is allergic to wheat then no wheat okay you're toasting the bread because it's easier for the child in school to eat problem so what was missing from this I think a little bit of fiber and a little bit of protein how the mother can put a little bit more protein into this potato sandwich you can add a little bit of paner you can add an egg into this sandwich protein top up good recipe my mouth is watering
