called moai and the concept of iigi or sense of purpose now watch this episode till the end if you want to uncover these unknown Japanese secrets to a long and healthy life so I'm really excited because my guest has flown in all the way from Japan and he's here to talk to me about the health screening philosophy in Japan and his firm who have brought healthc care screening to India please help me welcome Morita son hello it's really nice to have you today so how was your flight oh it's a long flight around 10 10 hours from Japan yeah and um you know you have been uh in Japan you worked across the world and and the reason I decided to invite you in here today was to ask you about Japanese uh the culture and also your company uh but as a nutritionist I want to start first about food okay right have you had your breakfast yeah huh what was for breakfast Indian food oh so you love Indian food yes okay wonderful is there anything in Japanese culture that your parents or your grandparents talk about when it comes to food yeah we eat uh as much as of course we like but basically our culture said like har okay is saying like stop to eat my stomach feel 80% don't exceed more than 80% 100% 20% uh 12% then it will be like become fat and become full and become lazy so 80% stop keep maintain Health nicely and when do you learn this ah I don't exactly remember the company or doctor tells you no in basically in the home yeah my father mother Grand culture yes yes okay yeah to educate for young kids to stop by E 80% so so I think another thing that Japan brings to us is the very large sumo wrestler yes yes so so he that sumo wrestler eats more that is like special training special eating training is there eating training eating training every day five six seven times eat and sleep soon so two two hours like sleep and eat again sleep again sleep so and with like you know massive training so it's to become big yeah scientist yeah they say that Japan whilst you have the sumo wrestlers who are very powerful you also have the karate people you have the Samurai warrior uh you have Japan having Health Spar you have Japan having a lot of Health screenings why does the Japanese government and the Japanese people and why is it there in Japanese culture that health screening is very important so basically health screening start in the war war time in Japan at that time Japanese government wanted to make all people healthier so at that time like you know the TV uh tuberculosis spread it so all the time uh to find at early stage to remove or to treat so this was this was a original but after that change the culture one by one for example like after that it's a cancer because age become country become aging so cancer screening is become important and after that so many people become rich and eat more so then like more heart attack and diabetic this kind of happen so that's why like lifestyle screening start so it's a like a long history around 50 around 70 years so lifestyle screening is not only happening for your generation it has been happening for your father's generation also uh yeah yes yes yes cancer screening start my father's generation lifestyle Disease start from my generation I'm aged now uh 42 okay so this start around 30 years ago so tell me something uh at what age do the Japanese people go for their first screening test 22 22 M when then I join the company then start this is a company obligation I'm not able to understand what is that Japanese philosophy in India people wait to fall sick at any age and go to doctor so why is the company screening at 22 this is actually government rule mhm so uh Japanese government uh has a obligation uh everybody employee have to be in health screening mhm so when I joined the company at 22 years old every year I have to go if I don't go company will punish me I have to go so I do not want to understand our company will punish you but we will leave that for the next podcast but India if you're listening in the company says you should go for screening government insists with the company please screen your employee for their health so this is mostly lifestyle disease cleaning correct lifestyle and cancer screening okay and are there um has this helped Japan have lower segment of the population having diabetes hypertension cancer is there statistical data showing an improvement over the last 3 four decades yes it's a drastically for example like my father's age young time my father's young time at that time like many fat people are there but like nowadays it's not not much see fat people if you come to Japan you don't see much fat people I I have seen that there are no if you watch films and documentary I'm looking in the the the station the zebra Crossing uh Tokyo Street 5 intersection you're like I looking no fat people yeah everybody the same style same suit do Japanese do Japanese people go to the gym yes yes uh we go but more than that is a eating habit is controlled and the exercise also controlled okay so you're saying that the screening also at very young age gives you the awareness that oh there is a weight gain there is a blood pressure there is some cholesterol so in your personal health screening was there anything that made you change your lifestyle Behavior yeah for example when I joined the company by 22 years old with every year take screening then definitely some cab is there so when I joined the company 68 69 kilo but after the certain time I become gross gross gross and reach to 80 you are 80 K 80 K whoa and age at 35 at that time every year doctor alloted me you you have to reduce you have to reduce weight and the same time this doctor in Dubai other part of world or in Japan Japan so the Japanese culture Japanese doctor all the time telling you have to reduce weight you have to exactly so he allowed many time how does the doctor in Japanese he tell you very kindly or he's taking and taking and verbally punching you nicely nicely nicely okay so then uh like he allotted and on the same time my uric acid also grows with with uh you know are you a biology student no I'm a a businessman so so suddenly the awareness is coming oh there is something called uric acid yeah exactly this is I I did I didn't know uric acid what is this but doctor told me you are here but now your kilo is weight is here and uric acid also followed so now you become 7.5 basically like average is five or six more than seven is dangerous I become seven eight and then doctor said like now you have to take medicine that to reduce like uric acid otherwise your kidney will be damaged in future I and then I asked him how many how long I have to take medicine he said lifetime I said what in the age of 35 I have no problem at all my feeling but he said like lifetime you have to take medicine I said wait wait doctor I don't want but he said no that's why I'm saying to reduce your weight with your reduce weight then your uric acid will go down and your kidney will be protected I said okay doctor but he didn't believe me because he ared many time but I didn't take action but after that I take action so from 80 kilo 78 75 now around 72 so then the uric acid will go down and doctor said good job keep your M weight at this at this level then you are healthy so that's why I'm like now but before I was a bit fat actually if I go like that my kidney damage maybe heart attack comes diabetic happen so this is the way Japanese people is control ha so this is affection yeah thank you for sharing that now you are with nura in India and uh what inspired Fujifilm a very large company to get into this Venture of healthcare and obviously AI being added to healthcare screening can you tell us a little bit about how this idea started what was the story did it start in Japan and now that you've come to India what's the whole business vision and plan yeah so actually I considered fairness what mean fairness is uh I'm Japanese when I was in Dubai I I I spent uh seven years in Dubai at that time annually I go back to J uh Japan for annual Health checkup screening but only for Japanese so my employee Indian African Middle East person European person no health screening no health screening ah so democracy of health screening was not there not yes also awareness is not there not but Japanese aware because doctors always yeah telling you I have to go back so I get like this kind of advice and then I become stream and so on but like uh my my teacher IND Indian guy actually Mr subin he said like uh it's you are lucky you are because Japanese you are maintained but for indiaan no for me there is no it's like unfair I said unfair unfair it's not my know problem but I could feel yes like I hired them I invit them so I have to maintain their health as well and especially he said he want to give this kind of screening for his mother because mother getting age but it's not available then I thought it's a it's one of the like you know mission for us to do that and actually I knock knock knock is the Ministry of Health in each country let's do the health screening this is country obligation country have to do that yes correct the the government is responsible for the People's Health yes yes in Japan it happen so I brought them to Japan to understand everything but unfortunately everybody busy to make a hospital it's not for the like screening Center for Healy people so that why okay why not us to do that by ourself so we made screening Center by ourself to show everyone and everybody follow this culture so I'm not like expecting like we continuously alone like that no once we start everybody follow and then everybody will do that then culture will be created so this is our aim that's a very interesting point creating the culture uh in fact um somebody asked me once that oh you are a celebrity nutritionist and only people with cash uh can come and spend on diet uh and then I thought to myself uh there was a recent research uh survey in India where uh the Indian population was spending 3 rupees 80 Pisa on fruit 3 rupes 80 p on vegetable 10 Rupees 80 Pisa on processed foods and beverages MH so India is a great government they have banned smoking in public places so they want to take care of us they know that smoking is injuries to putting the warning if you go on the theater if you go on television they're making them put that sign over there but when we are eating there is no warning when we checking our weight there is no warning this is culture so it is a culture that we need to change so does nura have any name specific any specifics to the name that Fuji chose nura or does it mean anything yeah actually a nura is like we make a mixed name so it's a new era it's and also new Radiology new radiology and also nura is one of the way is like we call the light so it's like if we put the light then like we can we can show the inside of the uh like our body and if Shadow is there then we can uh catch this Shadow to treat it so so Moran you're talking about Japanese culture and we know that Fuji films has been in medical equipment since 1936 yeah and now you'll have gone with this nura initiative of healthcare screening across the world and you're bringing in Ai and the Fujifilm medical pedigree so tell me a little bit more about how it happened and what was the story so basically Fujifilm is a film company H photography film x-ray film okay so from that time we start x-ray film okay F film change x-ray film to the digitized this is word fast the 0 and 1980 around and then we made digital system digital system and then automatically came this AI this kind of things coming in a technology why AI start because for example like annual Health checkup health screening we need to for 100 people sick people is only one or two so health professional can focus one or two basically if in the hospital but we are doing health screening for 100 people mhm it's not possible everybody do manually to see every report exactly and also Japan now start to reduce population getting age okay so somehow we need to manage so that's why AI came in so doctor and Ai and AI supported doctor from good sensitivity point of view and also like a work efficient standpoint so fuif made like a uh it it technology Healthcare it and on top of that Ai and we implemented in the Japanese Market so this is a good asset for Fujifilm so we brought this uh concept to the uh India and other countries so originally uh automatically this Ai and it came in so this is AI embedded like screen you know when we take care of our health there is something known as mass laws law of hierarchy and it talks about when you have enough of money your bread butter shelter clothes taken care of then you think of health so more evolved economies will take care of health screening any reason why uh Fuji films and nura decided to enter into India and work with the Indian population and bring this culture of health screening yeah of course one of the reason is India is nowadays biggest population country in the world so everybody focusing India definitely but as I said Mr subin he is Indian so that's why I wanted to support his country as well but actually we just entered in India but not only India India uh and also now we uh we started in vetnam Hanoi and Mongolia and usbekistan uh Dubai Saudi it's in aan so this year we will expand everywhere so India was just first country yeah so Maran uh I remember you entered India first in Bangalore my city yeah and I was one of the first people to go and get the testing and I was a little skeptical a CT scan from Japan radiation I was a little concerned so let's enable my fans and viewers in terms of is there any danger or the screening actually gives you crystal ball gazing into your future and how is it safe actually everybody knows High radiation is not good for the body but we made it very ultra low dose CT which makes like uh no affection of the human body okay so by technology we made it so it's compared to normal City 97% less radiation 97% lesser so only 3% of radiation we are using which is same as normal one x-ray ah so we made it safe number one why we did this this effort because City can find only early uh stage of the cancer for example in the lung in Japan like historically like we are doing uh x-ray chest x-ray chest x-ray for example TB is okay we can find but small cancer we cannot find it unfortunately so we are doing Japan annual screening for the lung but survival rate is still only 30% this is number one in the world us 20% UK 20% India unfortunately 3% only if you have lung cancer exactly so that's why I saying screen early low radiation CT is the only thing that can capture it exactly so this we we test it in the globally and then if we do uh lung cancer screening by CT UT load CT survival late is more than 80% so this is evidence basis so we need to use Cy but how we can use C safely this was our Challenge and also c mean x-ray is one image C is thousand image doctor's time is of course it take more time so it will be expensive High radiation it was very difficult but we made AI to make it faster and we made it low radiation so we mixed so this is actually we made a technology so this technology come to India very fast so this is like Innovation yeah I remember when I did my first screening and uh what I liked about new 's report was you did my head to toe every system in the body the blood test uh the oral cancer screening the gut cancer screening and for my wife you did the ovarian cancer screening and the mamogram screening and um it was very interesting because For the First Time In My Life After College somebody give me report card Moran I got a bee for my blood pressure can you imagine nutritionist B for blood pressure so my thinking is now next year I go back I get an A oh so I think Health Care screening with the whole complexity is about bringing in Awareness but let's dive a little bit deeper into this whole experience so you're talking about low radiation CT but it's essential to find any anomalies so that is the screening yeah right what age do you feel in India we should start screening age yes you said Japan is 22 you started because company said yeah but what is your advice my advice is saying same as Japan if possible but People's Health will be change when 30 35 is changing time getting weight and some uh like some problem comes 35 30 so around this timing is like mandatory to start but ear year is possible it's better you know sometimes I tell people um let's um go to nura do the screening you are in Bangalore which other cities in India Mumbai Hyderabad uh G guram yes okay so what is unique about nura as compared to let's say um my other Indian hospitals that are also doing health screening new a normally hair screening Center people feel not you do you like hair screening Center B uh no I get very scared because in the same kidney scan there is patient waiting for dialysis exactly and that nurse is treating me like a patient right but I'm not a patient scared scared and also uncomfortable so and also like a long time like 5 hours 6 hours no fun do you want to pay and do you want to go where is no fun as a human no human want to come in nice place and enjoying for this want to pay so it's a newa we made us like a Disneyland it's actually Disneyland by the way I went in from my health checkup and I was out in 1 hour 34 minutes now nura says 2 hours for the whole checkup but uh it was and like I was not in a waiting room thinking oh I have to do this test oh I have to do this test oh how much time for the next test oh I'm waiting oh he came after me how come he's going before me my mind was like on a train just Clockwork and beautiful music right uh lovely uh green tea yeah so that was a great experience so I think what's different for you is that um you're making it a Disney World like experience they can't control the outcome right your health screening is in your hands but I think nura gives you a report card yes right um can you tell me a little bit about U like I did the visceral fat right I come to Japan no fat people we very rarely see fat people only sumesa that is Sport right so is it because you do the dexa scan and the visceral fat screening how has this uh been an experience for your data coming out of India are the Indians aware of visceral fat and when they become aware of visceral fat what is their reactions for example uh basically people doesn't know the word of B fat and inside of the body never see we showed inside of the your B how much b f you have and we just show this is nobody like that you are like that so of course if too much it cause heart attack cause diabetic so you have to reduce this image to be like that so people can understand easily so image is saying everything so we don't need to make people scared or something we just say you are like that better to reduce automatically people will reduce so for example like Fujifilm India people we did the screening fast year so 78 77% people was obese 77% yeah B fat is like a threshold is 100 but like 78% 77% of people is more than that the obase area but next year uh 68% of people could reduce it I asked them why how you could reduce it they said first before nobody said reduce rce weight reduce it but nura told us and also nura told show us the image Vis I was scared I was surprised so I want to reduce it so he take action by himself to reduce it so with this reduce the B fat automatically cholesterol sugar everything become better so nura is like not only find something is find and show and people will take like action by himself self motivation so this is is a important Point as you see blood pressure is high okay let use more so this is a yeah yeah I did a lot of breathing but this is very interesting that the employees did the visceral fat they did not know what is visceral fat they were able to see what is visceral fat they were able to know that Beyond 100 cm uh is too much viseral fat lower it down but when let's say we build this as a culture um does this exist in Japan is my question see you did your first test at 22 and uh doctor then at 30 said uric acid High bring down bring down bring down are there people who also don't listen because I want to know when we in my country of India I want to know that 1.3 billion people have to be healthy rich or poor health screening should be a must but there will be two types of people oh I know my BP is high oh I know my uric acid is high oh I know my Uric my visceral fat is high and then there will be some people it's okay visceral fat is okay so in Japan other people like that or how do I pr see Japanese have experience so what can we learn from that part how do we scare people or how do we motivate people I think it's a continuous uh followup is important H so for example me I didn't reduce the weight okay Dr continuously continuously and one they reach certain level and then he punish me to give medicine like you are be in like that so continuous followup is very important I think I think I I hear you because what could happen is like I have a lot of clients who come for diet plan nutrition plan and they' have been with me 5 six seven years initially I put them Wing scale this is your weight this is your fat percentage reduce reduce reduce reduce uh I do blood test also reduce reduce reduce but one day they get some pain some BP fainting or have to go to hospital and then doctor puts the gun to the head you have to reduce um do you think the Indian doctors should like my family doctor should they tell normal people please go and do your health screening in Japan do the doctors ask you to do health screening or only the companies do the health screening basically everybody in employee so everybody have to go after retire of 60 years old government support health screening for for example my father and mother is uh now age 79 78 so government uh is bring the bus to the near the my house so they can go free screening so everybody have to go screening is a culture and also everybody be healthy reduce away this is a culture so it's not like one shot or something I think it's a in India once understand this kind of health screening important and reduce the weight is important har is important everybody start to talk each other this is a start of culture I think so that's why I want to bring as much as possible new to everywhere in the world not only India so then everybody take screening everybody understand this kind of things and everybody talk this will be the start of the culture so this is what I a so in the Fuji film team the culture everyone reduced the visceral fat after the first year why you reduce visceral fat um what are the other statistics that you could have seen among the Indian population if you observed or that you can share with us that I need to make India aware of actually India problem is obese and also diabetic so many people is already diabetic on a they don't know about it till this they don't know yes and are we finding this in the companies that are coming to you using neura screening where they're bringing younger people like you say 30 35 so I will send people voluntary meaning they're spending their own money to go and do the health screening maybe they are company's not aware or the company doesn't have the facility or whatever reason but the people which are testing in the company are you finding youngsters also youngsters means the new software Engineers bang City we are uh the the entrepreneurs business people office workers India is a growing Country Now companies are booming so we're hiring more people so 20 to 30 are you finding people who are having screening healthare problems actually it's a even young too much ber the VIS F inside and like a diabetic not that much in in a younger age but uh yeah it's mostly like Biz fat is a common so once reduce a Biz fat everything will be in the control range diabetic also will be control range so basically the dieting Health control uh this is a important point I think yeah and also one point uh for example I also had one experience uh in India I could find like H pyro in in the neural screening I could find the H py by myself and then I go back to Japan and Doctor confirm yes you have H py inside of the stomach and then hpy is a cause of cancer so doctor request me uh to take I will give medicine so you kill H py then three three months three weeks dose of antibi Jaan only one one week only one week only one week and I take medication and then H pyro is killed completely so doctor said congratulation Moran you will never get stomach cancer anymore I'm happy okay I'm free from stomach cancer so this is also in expir also is a many people uh has in India so we have to kill who decides what health screening to do in nura do you have one doctor or you have a team of scientists how has the whole process started basically it's everything this trend come from Japan okay whatever we are doing in Japan we are bringing plus like Innovation like CT basis and um like uh for example Imaging and immediately explaining everything so basically it's Japan plus uh this kind of innovation Plus for example like oral cancer is important in India so many people has oral cancer because of like Tac uh Che chewing yes yeah but it's not happen in Japan so we added this kind of things understood so you see what is the lifestyle of that country and maybe that screening is required uh you know in every place I don't know about Japan but in India people say ah I don't want to know I better not know no no no I don't want to know any screening what is your advice to them because see in Japan they're making it mandatory for a healthier country lesser expense on the government for um for the surgeries or any issues that happened so when somebody says oh I don't want to know as a Japanese person you speak as a Japanese person and tell India why you should do screening and those who are saying no no no I don't want to screen it is better not to know what should we tell them what should I tell them ha screening is not identify the cancer or identify the problem we can map where you are basically so your health is going where you don't know sometimes but we can show you are here so you reduce to change the rout in nice way or not if you have some blockage already to remove this blockage so it's for example like a cancer is no more death disease in Japan because we are we can find all Way by stage one so just remove the cancer then it will be so cancer is not this so Maran you know I sit in the nutrition clinic and I tell my client why don't you do an annual screening health check no no no Mr I do not want to do health screening check now Japanese culture please do health screening check what would be your advice as a Japanese person to Indians on I don't want to do health screening basically people want to know where you are by yourself in health you don't know by yourself where you are but once to the screening basically we can show where you are you are going right direction or you are going in different direction is nura is not only the to find the disease we can correct way prior before disase happen so this is how we can do that always we can identify the annually by annual screening and then from last year become better or not and corrected or not we can guide to do the healthier life so this is uh important for screening sometimes I've had some of my clients also come in and say that uh I think the test uh is not correct because what happens is um they go out and then do further health screening and doctor says thumbs up no problem so I'll share my story with you uh my wife and me did the nura test and for the women you do the ovarian screening uh so there was a little bit of a c score A B C D so she got C so I am scratching my head and thinking uh okay what do we do so the do nura says go meet a good gynecologist so we went to meet the good gynecologist she says oh this screening is there okay you do this test this test this test do this test so we went to the hospital did everything they did further screening and then came back oh zero is there but then that doctor asked why you doing this so we said we want to know no you don't need to know so now here's an an interesting thing M and India we need to understand this clearly the difference between Japanese culture and Indian culture and I'm not saying our culture in India is wrong all I'm saying is that when you do screening you know the road map like Morita son has said it's like saying I have to come to your house in Tokyo Moran I'm coming to your house you don't give me any map no Google Map no nothing I don't know how to reach a house M testing is like a road map you know the direction to take if the direction is bad you can get off that road direction is good continue on that road so with my wife we went one step further I asked for the genetic test for the cancer markers and braa 1 braa 2 Gene test we did that test and the test came clear so touchwood the road map was given to us which we have never discovered but get this my mother-in-law is a gynecologist doctor so she's like who told you to do this test so I think I want to make culturally India aware that testing is not questioning the doctor testing is only telling the doctor hey doctor could I be your best friend not at 60 years of age but every year I come and see you at 35 years of age and and you be my best friend who catch catches me by the callar and says Ah you got to see start behaving yourself well so any other interesting Snippets from nura that you have from technology or experiences now being almost a year and a half two years in India uh from technology Wise from technology or even patience what is the success or any My Success is there I got B in blood pressure it came to a this year okay and and now this how my cholesterol went up to be so now I'm like oh I can't eat this fatty food I can't eat so do you have successes like that either in technology or discoveries or statistics that you can share with us we already did around 50,000 screening 50,000 screen 50,000 screening so definitely maybe around 1,000 of life we protect it but not only number but for example like uh again my my teacher Mr subin he came last year uh two years ago Kum was little bit carum no problem and he eat it eat it no problem but last year uh this year he came Kum gross and then he's not scared and then last week I met with him he is don't he he doesn't eat birani he will eat some but stop in a certain time and reduce weight so this is for my most important person he start be Health here and for example uh my my partner Dr kashim Dr kashim also is now for yesterday I think going to dinner and then I eat everything everybody eat everything but Dr kashim stop sometime he he didn't eat yes yes and I asked him why you don't eat he said I have to reduce I have to control so definitely we are like uh protecting many lives for future so this is I think impact so we are uh we are in guro Bangalore Hyderabad and Mumbai um how can I book an appointment at nura what's the process yeah uh nura doin is our website and then um uh you can call directly or you can book from the website so it's easily find the location and the book The SL then people can come and which days of the week are you open 365 days you open 3 yeah we're a big population so you got to fulfill a lot of things so 365 days and what time to what time I'm a busy executive I don't have time to get up in the morning and go I've got my office I'm working with America time so what type to what time are you open uh from 8 to 5 8 to 6 I think is like this this time is opening and it just takes 2 hours yeah so I got VIP service I think so it is 2 hours for me or 2 hours for everybody everybody it's important in Japan for example we go in the morning time screening and come back to office or 3:00 3 Hour 3 3 p.m. I have to go screening Center 5:00 p.m. finish and go back to home so it's like not like a full day offer something it's a two hour that's it so a follow-up question is okay I'm I'm going I can go to office and everything uh do I need to go in empty stomach fasted state or we can go to nura at any time yeah nura uh is not not required any fasting so anytime people can come anytime and with eat food it's no problem so it's like any everybody can come freely anytime yeah in fact somebody asked me this question like isn't it better that I go to nurana fasted State and I said no look this screening is for the first level of a test uh and if we find something in that then we do further test in fasted state or subsequent tests so I don't think you need to really do be fasted for a health screening test but if you're looking to find a disease say like diabetes or high lipid profiles then you may want to do a 12-hour fasted state but at the end of the day if you're taking the day off from the office book your appointment first thing in the morning is my advice but if your boss is not giving you leave you know your body is the most expensive real estate then make sure you finish your office hours ask for early leave that day and go and get your nura test done even at 3:00 in the afternoon so another question is where can I go to book a test yeah so newa is like a digital in the digital space everything can do so you go nur. then you can find the telephone number or you can book uh uh you can select a location and then uh select the time and then people can go so India at the four centers of nura currently you will get a special gift from me go down into the descriptor below and find my clickable link which will give you a discount coupon code fill in that form and trust me from my desk you will take care of your health at a better rate now coming back to some of my last questions Moran what are the future developments or future enhancement that we can expect from nura H yeah so nura is as I said lifestyle disease and cancer screening so this is now current isue but we will start with locomotive syndrome locomotive syndrome is a quite important topic for the Aging people so like uh the uh sometime lay down this is like because of the muscle because of the bone health so this is also we will include in future and also is a dietary activity also hope we can work together and plus like we will work in the regenerative medicine as well so this new new new generative medicine uh can help for the people uh the more ahead is here awesome you know we talked about nura in depth and how you can book an appointment and what's the importance of neuro health screening but for those who can't imagine could you quickly walk me through is once I booked an appointment at nura and you said oh yes Mr Ryan Fernando please come to Nora at 9:00 in the morning what can I expect could you walk me through the neura process okay so once uh you will uh come to nura and then our guest relation executive uh is waiting so we don't call you as patient because you're guest so our guest relation executive welcome you and give you a coffee and fill the form and then start the screening once like a QR code will come is check in like a airport and once go up and then to change the cross and then like a Japanese like a kimono style uh it's a very comfortable screening uh wear and then I go to blood test uh ECG eye test ear test citt everything go back and then finish and then uh around 1 hour with 1 hour and a half test will finish and then go back to the uh to change the cross and go down and doctor is waiting and doctor will expl everything by Imaging basis this is your heart this is your kidney this is your your liver you never see inside of your body it's very interesting it's first time you can see your heart visibly so you can enjoy Eno a lot uh sometimes people will come with family uh wife uh husband so everybody can enjoy and after screening uh we will give you report immediately by paper and the digital so people can go back to home so this is our work through in fact it's very interesting that you talked about you can see inside I remember when I did my first neura test about 2 years ago when he first launched and it showed um I I'd got a severe cold about a month prior and it was there for 3 weeks so I could see in my lungs and the doctor explained the full capillary Network or Alvi in the lungs and I could see like 20% of my lungs had taken a royal beating and uh so that visual image when I'm on the treadmill or I'm doing rowing I'm like lungs get better lungs get better so I'm breathing due to right so when we know we can see visceral fat or some reading or have a scor card I think human behavior changes um very interesting is that can old people also do the neuros screening yeah sometimes the people said age itself is a make disease because like uh maybe in a different way I it's a if car if new car basically is no problem but if 10 years 20 years 5 50 years years if we use then Kasam has some trouble and the problem comes so basically it's better to uh clean up and then like a maintain so the higher age people is actually is more required for this kind of Maintenance Beyond neura Japanese are famous for so many things um what do you do Morita son for good health besides neuros screening and listening to your doctor is there anything unique from your Japanese culture that you do as an individual that your parents have taught you about do you drink Macha tea ma but my father and mother work a lot okay always work work work work so that why they are B hey so even like B some knee pain comes or like leg pain comes but with tube exercise make musle more strong and then treat and walk walk work so I think this is a very important uh to do the exercise plus of course eat less and also Mach te also every day my father I think five six drink of this cup he is drinking so I think maybe this is also one of the important Point yeah and in Japanese food has a lot of uh seaweed in it Nori it has Nori Seafood um and uh do you think that's part also as that you know know you have sushi and you have all of these things they very potion controlled yeah so is it part of uh Japanese culture to ovat maybe if I come to Japan and I say Morita son I want to eat 25 pieces of [Music] sushi would Japanese do that no only sues yeah yeah yeah okay so I think do restaurants serve smaller portions or serve big portions smaller portion basically we will uh sub small small small mhm so basically it's not much itat so it's slowly slowly eat small small portion that why I think we can feel like stomach uh in you know sufficient okay so with small portion uh I think this is important and also as you said is she uh the nor uh it's a we call wakame wakame is what it's a um uh she she Sheed so this we we eat she weed a lot with mis soup inside I think this uh I heard that this is very good for the health and but in unfortunately in India not much so that's why like a thyroid problem is happened is like my Japanese friend several people start to say like thyroid is like some problem but after after that he they brought a lot of wakame sh with from Japan and they eat all the time then I recovered I and this friend is Japanese Japanese guy yes oh so he was not living in Japan yeah he is inves in the India but the SE people say the same things so basically um screening is one that can tell you you have a nutritional deficiency um thyroid deficiency and then changing your food is another another way so Japanese do believe in eating healthy eating less and doing a lot of health screening right you know maritan I love Japanese culture so much that I even learned how to eat with chopsticks so I find that very unique and you know what I know why you are slim because it's so difficult to eat 50 grains of rice with one chopstick in India we take the hand I can take so much of rice in Japan you take only this much of rice but speaking of Japan how is it is Japan okav longevity people live till old age or hustle bule most populated city in the world Tokyo what is it like for a Japanese youngster and what is it for a Japanese elderly person so for example like my grandfather and my grandmother they live till 96 years old but they were in bed when they 96 full healthy no full healthy how actually for like my grandmother uh always like uh move moving moving so for example to make some food for the kids uh not kids like grandkids and uh even she go field to make like watermelon so whenever we go there and he bring like a big watermelon I made like that and like you know so it's very active actually so my grandfather also he was like he was like aw lawyer before not judge so he always like read the book and whenever I go read the book and walk around it's active actually so I think this active uh work around uh move so this is I think one of the important uh to make longevity I think also in uh we see that when I look at videos of Tokyo like good cars uh tall skyscrapers Billboards but also people in The Crossing so in the cities is there anything that you see in Japanese culture That You Don't See in other parts of the world it's a busy City everybody walk like land so do people have H like is it expensive to own a car in Tokyo no everybody has a car basically but in the daytime we cannot use a car because too much population and the company also not allowed to come office by car not allowed everybody use train is it true that some of the trains the the station is in inside the building uh the basement of the building and you go up and you're in your office directly is yes yes yes yes many many many it's like everybody have to use train so uh once wake up prepare and go my to the my TR uh station by bicycle where you keep the bicycle in a station nobody takes a cycle we have organized parking there parking there Co and then like after that you know go to train and go to the office and the like I think the without any exercise I'm stepping around 6,000 step every day so the city forces you to do movement right right right right okay and lunchtime do do Japanese people take lunch break yeah we take lunch break but uh it depends on the people but you we have in Hood uh Hood cod in the office okay and it's everything mentioned calor for example this menu this much calorie this menu this much calorie so like screening of your food yeah yeah yeah yeah it's 800 kilo calorie this like a chicken is 700 kilo calorie this rice big rice 200 this small rice uh 120 this small uh hey uh rice is 80 kilo calorie so I put take 80 and small like a fish it's a not fried fish it's a steamed fish fish okay this is a 200 kilo calorie steam fish steam fish yeah steam fish uh miso soup and small hery rice and uh even vegetable vegetable several vegetable this vegetable is like with like a potato is 150 kilo calorie this is only 20 kilo calorie I like this and then P so basically I try to make it inside of 500 kilo calorie in a office so I eat and go back so it's basically because I know how much kilo calorie I can spend around 2,500 kilo calorie in a day so it should be in a less so it's controlled wow that's amazing U the in the Japanese culture um you know uh you have uh tea ceremonies right and you said that your father uh drinks matcha tea four five times a day I as a nutritionist know that matcha tea has very high uh antioxidants so basically uh research has shown that Macha is very good for Eye Health uhhuh so it'll be very interesting to look into nura records of scanning in Japan because cataract I think in Japan will be the lowest and India will be the highest because we have high cholesterol food high fat food no antioxidants so that's very interesting but um holidays what do Japanese do for holidays it is there a concept of spas or or uh you go into uh the Springs where the water is there so uh is that uh SAA SAA yes and and health Springs and is is that part of Japanese culture no it's very much for example in my weekend basically I I love to work so even 24 hours I can work so end of the week also I'm working but it's a sometimes okay it's a tired okay let's go jogging and then in the night time basically after kids prepare everything then I go uh hot spring inside of City many hot spring is there okay so take hot spring and then like uh around 2 hours go sauna and sweat and go water cold water and then hot spring again sauna so in one night in one night every every week I go and you you go hot and cold hot and cold hot and cold three four times basically no wonder your skin is so good so then become healthier so it's like SAA and hot spring is one of the good culture so final question Moran favorite Indian foods I like uh Paradise oh you like patas okay par and Paradise bani ah so that means nura in Hyderabad is really working well because they're always calling Morita San to Hyderabad and then he's like paradise for me yes so Moran Japanese culture amazing health screening amazing I love it how do we share this message with the world and what is your expansion plans with nura across the world can we expect more screening centers yeah so now we have uh four Center in India and Japan Vietnam Mongolia and we are opening now in the Dubai and Saudi usbekistan and we are planning Egypt South Africa Kia so we will go everywhere in the world so my commitment to my chairman is we will make one 10,000 screening Center in the world so we will support uh for 100 million of Life per year so this is our Mission and the vision so I don't know when we can reach but in the lifetime we will reach it so I think I think this is a very very Noble Mission and 100 million people I think I will help you in India for 100 million people because we need to make yes we need to make uh people much more healthier so Maran this has been an amazing podcast I laughed a lot I learned a little bit about Japanese culture and I promise you we're going to do another podcast and
