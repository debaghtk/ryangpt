Transcript: the modern day conveniences that liberalization of the country brought is huge right I mean we are all living it and enjoying it but along with that came the bane of some of these lifestyle diseases living with diabetes worldwide people have high blood sugars there's an increased risk of cancer one out of three adults have high blood pressure propensity of people to have these issues postco has increased what we've realized in a post pandemic world is that loneliness and social isolation is the new sitting and the new smoking but we hearing of so many people getting strok nowadays in 2020 65% of the deaths in the country were due to ncds our body is very interconnected when you have such vigorous activity the lung and the heart have to be in such s so let's not mistake a Fit Body for a healthy [Music] body it's the first time we unfold a whole new dimension of healthcare ladies and gentlemen it's a privilege to welcome our distinguished guest today on the hot podcast Dr Satya shiram CEO of preventive Healthcare at Apollo hospitals and Dr Manish matu Karnataka region CEO of Apollo hospitals they join us on a journey where we talk about preventing serious health conditions recognizing and managing potential health risk early on through advanced AI shaping a better quality of life so sit back and enjoy as we unravel the secrets of a healthy life with Apollo Pro Health uh um first of all thank you so much for having me here Dr Ryan um I work as Regional CEO with Apollo hospitals I'm based out of Bangalore most happening city in the country today um and um you know this year our focus is largely on Pro Health and how we drive Wellness uh in the city and across the country very happy to be here awesome Dr Satya it's a privilege to have you over here tell us a little bit about how you landed into this seat of preventive Healthcare thank thank you so much Ryan absolutely delighted to be here um AT AP poo hospitals as uh heading the preventive Health vertical um my mandate is to help shift the consumer mindset from Curative to preventive and uh I bring sort of deep passion for driving consumer Behavior change um and I think that's the Crux of uh changes to Lifestyle the only thing that we can control if we want to be healthier tomorrow than we are today you know whenever we have conversations in the corridor everyone's talking about how India is the seat of ancient wisdom we discovered the zero over here mathematics center of the world and obviously the AIC Sciences are thousands of years old and so I'm assuming that this ancient wisdom would have trickled down into our subsequent Generations what we're noticing is that we are getting aot lot of these non-communicable diseases in the ancient time we had diseases that killed us because of typhoid or malaria but now we're getting rammed by stuff like diabetes and hypertension and heart attacks so is this on the rise and what do you think doctor went wrong since ancient wisdom and now modern sickness Ryan the non-communicable diseases which um typically cover diabetes hyper ention cancers um obesity as well as now increasingly mental health are definitely on the Rise um if we take uh the Indian population back in 1990 so as recent as 1990 25% of the debts in the country were due to the ncds or non-communicable disas 25% that means 1/4 of our population was dying because they were slapping their own selves yes kind of I I couldn't get it from my next door neighbor or my auntie or my uncle I brought it upon myself upon ourselves and at that time the infectious diseases uh were about 65% of the uh deaths in the country I think Medical Technology access to vaccines a lot of um awareness about some of the communicable diseases has resulted now in the these diseases going down and the non-communicable diseases on the other hand have been steadily increasing in 2020 65% of the deaths in the country were due to ncds so we've gone from 25% to 65% in 1990 to 2020 so the ancient wisdom of ayura is now just a lovely name plate on our Board of India but internally we're getting sicker and we're not getting sicker because of infectious diseases it's it's these lifestyle diseases that's right I think um just to add on to what you said uh lifestyle changes that we've had in the last 20 OD years rapid urbanization pollution alcohol smoking uh processed food right and uh sedentary lifestyle um while you know we may be aware more about our health today but I don't think it's um in our Behavior it's actually something that we are abiding by so I think all those things things are actually leading to a rapid increase in ncds and seven out of 10 deaths today in in the world happen because of NCS so seven out of 10 deaths in the world happen because of non-communicable diseases which basically is you don't get it from something you kind of inflict it upon yourself so where do we act where do we act do we wait till we get that slap and in your case you're giving me statistics of death so does a person need to wait till they die and then act or I know I'm joking about something about death but people need to wake up and get serious so where do I get serious do I get serious uh at the first sign of a symptom do do I get serious when i faint and fall down so as doctors uh you know practicing this Mantra of not Curative medicine but preventive medicine Where do we start how do we get people to get started if you see a symptom it's already in my mind a tad bit on the later side doctor if I can interrupt you for the lay man out there symptom what do we mean by symptom a symptom is something that you feel is off and that means it could be a pain somewhere a discomfort away from the normal way that something is functioned example you have a pain in the gut area or your digestive processes right and bowel movements are irregular you have pain in the chest area all of these are examples of symptoms something that you can feel visibly see sometimes touch this is what it is is a symptom and when we say you come in after a symptom at that point like I said it's a little bit on the later side our body is actually built to be very very resilient and therefore can compensate for a lot of the abuse is that a lot of us have this god syndrome that we indestructible therefore we ignore the symptom exactly or symptom or the even the path towards that right you sort of start getting a little bit of a niggling feeling you know something is off the sleep is a little bit disturbed but you choose to procrastinate and push it out until it becomes something that's really tangible at that point it's a symptom let's take a example um one of the rising conditions um in India is fatty liver when we think about a liver transplant or liver curosis automatically most of us think about alcohol related liver curosis I drink a lot of alcohol and my liver goes off right our uh liver transplant surgeons say these days for every alcohol related liver transplant they do they do one for non-alcoholic fatty liver conditions ah so what you're trying to say is that just because somebody's smoking or drinking in the previous time we doctors said oh this guy is going to get alcoholic fatty liver disease now you're saying even without drinking they're getting it that's right even without drinking they're getting fatty liver conditions that's different from the alcohol related curosis let's unpack this a little bit more how a liver gets uh becomes a fatty liver is essentially due to excess carbohydrates right because the first place of storage for excess carbohydrate when it's converted into something called glycogen is the liver it's only when the liver's capacity to hold that excess carbohydrates is surpassed does it actually go and settle in other places now when there's excess accumulation of these carbohydrates as glycogen in the liver there are structural changes to the liver and that be only picked up in an ultrasound it will not show up in a blood test or the of the liver function tests that's much much later when the liver has stopped compensating for this and says I give up I give up and that's when the liver function test starts to be abnormal but if you do an ultrasound you can actually pick up the structural changes much earlier doctor for the people that don't know what is this ultrasound yeah ultrasound is actually an IM in technology that uses sound waves to help visualize what's going on inside your body but why would somebody do this so typically we have heard uh doing an ultrasound for pregnancy related yes right look baby in the in the womb and so forth um but what we found is the ultrasound of the abdominal region actually picks up a number of abnormal uh conditions in in this area so stomach gallbladder liver pancreas ovary uterus right all of these get picked up in an ultrasound also you could do an ultrasound of stes for kidney stones gallbladder stones also coted arteries sometimes you do an ultrasound to be able to see where where is the coted AR it's around here in the neck so so the one in the neck that's right why would we screen an ultrasound for the neck cared artery this is for typically for stroke you know but youngsters will be like I'm not going to get a stroke but we're hearing of so many people get stroke nowadays so if I am in the 20s to 30s 30s to 40s or 40s to 50s are we doing this ultrasound or this uh you know the checking of my neck artery and all who tells me to do this yeah so also Ryan you don't do everything for everyone at all ages okay right different uh people have different risk factors different age milestones you actually the in Risk increases so we actually can um think about a combination of tests that are most appropriate for each individual or group of individuals okay got it and if I can add to that you know recently in our Pro Health packages we've launched eight specific packages so um you know the most popular tests that people opt for our whole body packages but essentially that used to be restricted to you know 40 50 60 they used to kind of be more uh you know uh the uptake used to be more in these age this age category but now we' realized that you know as as you said the onset of this disease is also in the younger age group so we've curated packages for our younger age group as well so how young 20 to 40 so a 20year old to 30-year-old can come in and get tested yes yes and we've curated the packages based on the disease conditions that are most prevalent in that age group so we have that's that's very interesting you know recently I was working in one of the fortune 500 companies and they contracted us to do the nutrition plans for people and we just asked for a basic blood test of the 20 to 30 year olds and we found that more than 67% of the blood test that we did had very high liid profile yes yes and the the the youngsters were shocked yeah yeah so that's also part of our genetics as South Asian population where we are more prone to higher cholesterol you know what could be some of the modern day reasons that the 20s to 30s and 30s to 40s are facing these current lifestyle diseases what from the air or from the water or from the food or or is it my karma boomi or something that is causing this so as doctors screening thousands of people you are seeing statistics so you obviously are like Sherlock Holmes and you will have an inference what are the modern day conveniences that are putting a Target on people one I think to add to Dr satya's Point genetically we are predisposed to more coronary arteries cardiovascular I can blame my grandfather grandmother but only that's part of the story I would say even in our genetic testing protocols that we have well established in our pro health program uh genetic screening results have shown us that that predisposition causes only 1/4 of the contribution to the overall inness of the person the others are you know your lifestyle like so 25% I blame my ancestry ancestors for that and 75% is my mine which is your you know dietary intake your sedentary lifestyle pollution in there you know uh and the kind of food that I'm eating and of course while we may be aware about our you know Health needs but we are not really uh you know doing much about it uh like we see we are you know more leading a lot of sedentary um lifestyle choices um I think those are contributory factors also Indians genetically are insulin resistant more than Caucasians that leads to you know High predisposition for diabetes and of course uh you know resulting impact on other other organs as well so that I think something we really have to watch out for so Dr Manish what I'm hearing and what all our fans are listening in is that okay at 25% I can blame my family genes I still want to blame my family maybe for my diabetes hypertension catract Yeo all of those things right but as a young adult should I screen when should I screen and what should I screen for for this blaming my family part let's call it genetics so um because I think if I know that I'm going to have something that has a risk factor I'm hoping we are smart enough to say that I inherited it but I won't activate it so what could we be doing uh as tests so Ryan I'm going to share a personal anecdote here I actually did my own genetic sequencing and uh some of the results that U actually stood out for me and made me change my behaviors right um first I realized that I had um higher likelihood of developing hypertension which is blood pressure so that's something that I realized as part of my genetic profile I therefore now regularly take my blood pressure every week now it also helps that I'm in a hypertensive household and everyone goes around passes the BP meter and uh we now make it a ritual I knock onward don't have it yet but because that genetic sequencing result told me that I'm at a higher risk than the average Indian I now do this regularly I'm hoping that I can catch any Rising Trend so not at any given one point but a rising Trend that then allows me to um address it well before it becomes a problem so you did the testing know that you have a hypertensive kind of Gene and you're now screening with a BP monitor so you're you're doing it proactively are you changing anything in your life so let me give you an example of another Gene that uh was identified where apparently I have a tendency to add more weight with high fat foods ah the minute I saw that I had a red or higher than the average Indian it's automatically made it somewhat tangible for my brain to process this as something that's not good for me and since then I have been watchful so when Dr Satya sees a samosa on her plate she's like you're not worthy to enter my body right now I actually asked am I allowed to enjoy that this week so let me rewind slightly with you because I want a listeners to understand that you're a CEO of AP poloo preventive Healthcare and you're making changes because you've understood the crystal ball gazing into your future which is if you were younger did you eat a samosa with abandon and now with this knowledge is it making you realize that your body is the most expensive real estate it's not changeable and therefore you have to make some changes is is there a difference between the younger version of you and now the more why iser older version of you absolutely I actually developed kidney stones oh very young okay and uh that was a wakeup call for everyone has a wake up call at some point in their life and now in my 40s the number of things I know I really wish someone had uh slapped me awake in my 20s and told me the few things that I needed to change U so that I could enjoy these um unscrupulous behaviors every now and then and you know I think that brings us to the point that 20 years back we didn't have the luxury of genetic testing today's 20 and 30 year olds have that luxury and they must use this because it's very important to get that tested in the early years once the disease onset happens you know then you can only reverse the disease but if you get the testing done in time you can actually prevent the oner of diseases you know I so much agree with both of you um when we studied in our younger years we didn't have the access to the internet today's generations have technology right much smarter generation like um you know if you have a laptop that's running only at 60% you upgrade it to a new laptop that runs at 120% so I think this younger generation is quite smart and once they begin to realize that I can have a crystal ball gazing into my Ram processing speed or what back foot do I have in my body so I also did my Gene testing and I discovered that I'm gluten intolerant MH I wrote a whole book about it called wheatless why because when I was a teenager nobody told me that I should avoid milk and gluten and so I got acne hammering me late into my 30s and when I did a gene test that which was sent to America many many years ago the guy called up from there was speaking Hindi and he said by so you can't eat bread who told you to eat bread but who's going to tell me culturally that my dad Ma and my my grandfather were at two strong different locations so we're done blaming our genetics and our parents and our grandparents but um if you look at statistics from the medical industry and I'm sitting on this side of the lens what are the life lifestyle diseases statistically that as an Indian I should be looking at for so which is the which is the top G Gunda I would say preo the top Gunda was you know the cardiovascular diseases so cardiovascular for the lay man hypertension coronary artery diseases you know um blockages artery blockages basically everything to do with the heart pumping of the heart that was the most common postco we've seen a massive shift towards cancer lung cancer liver cancer um stomach cancer among males and in females breast cancer cervical cancer and then lung cancer in that order so that's what we see most prevalence of but also mental health so what is the age group of people that come in for the preventive Health checkups like broad picture as young as what and as old as young as 25 as old as I mean there's no so if 25-year-old is listening in they can actually make the effort to come in and get screened and test in everything absolutely I think as a habit we have to incorporate that early on and as you rightly said you know in the early part of the show we shouldn't really wait for something to happen to us before we take that test I mean just think about it we get a car service twice a year four times a year but I know of many adults with strong family history not getting themselves tested for you know years together which is I think an extremely dangerous state to live in you know this is just popping up in my head which is we get so many people saying that right I do not want to know as a medical doctor I mean you guys will see the worst of the worst right and now you're sitting on the side of the fence where you're saying if I throw a ball I know where it's going to land and this person saying I don't want to know where it's going to land yes what what do we say to such people who are sitting in the fence saying I don't want to know I want to enjoy my life but then they're hurting the whole family after that exactly the same thing I'm saying just think about the impact and the consequences that procrastination is going to have on your family to me that was the biggest wakeup call many many years back when I started regularly doing these health checks because you just have one life and nothing is going to substitute that you can't be replaced you know for your family and all there's no replacement so just think about that you know think about your parents I know so many young young men and women who lost their lives and today I see their parents really I mean not having that closure not you know having nobody for support I think that's a very sad state to be in for the family I think in addition to the loss of life it's also the additional economic burden on the family so when we diagnose something very late there may still be treatments available and you and your family want to give everything a shot before uh saying this is it we've tried everything and that costs a lot of money what cost L of stress so in addition to you know God forbid the loss of life it's also this additional economic and uh stress burden that you're adding to the people around you is it true doctor because I was reading about these blue zones um around the world where people live into the hundreds and Japan is one of those areas and apparently Japan started the system of screening early catching diseases early so you know we we pride ourselves at Aura and the ancient Tex and all of that stuff but we're living so modern today what is it that we need to do or what does the population need to do in terms of lowering their medical cost what are the some of the small things that they could start doing I think uh what's in each of our hands is I'm going to say first um really evaluate your lifestyle habits and these are around what you consume right and that's a diet food uh water how much alcohol drugs so everything you consume second is how much you move so it's not just about Fitness strength that's important it's also about how much you keep moving through the day climb the stairs versus taking the elevator walk to get your coffee versus expecting it to show up at your desk take a walking meeting with somebody or a standing meeting with a group of people rather than continuously sitting the third is sleep sleep enough but also watch the quality of your sleep to make sure that it is restful for you because that's when your body actually rejuvenates um and your brain has enough time to process everything that it's col collated through the day the fourth is Stress Management the problem with stress is that the levels of cortisol and adrenaline hormones that go up it's actually a good thing when it is in very short bursts and helps us focus and be attentive and actually perform much better when it is sustained over a long period of time that's called chronic stress then the body doesn't even have chance to get it back to normal levels and that triggers a whole bunch of Downstream pathways in your body causing everything from indigestion to diabetes cardiovascular issues and so forth and the last piece is actually a community people that you actually mindfully engage with in different parts of your life so this you know balance across different aspect of your lifestyle is I think what we have in our own hands and can do in addition to this I think there is screening right Manish absolutely I think screening and Screen Time make screening an annual ritual for for yourself and not just yourself the whole family I think because you know ill health affects the whole family that's fun and you know screen time you know please cut down on that and last but not least and it's an important Point what she alluded to was build meaningful relationships today I feel that taking a backseat of a lot of time you know the the diet the moving and the sleep I think a lot of people are doing that even in today's generation but this relationship at Community you sit on a bus you sit on a train you sit on a flight everyone's in their phone yeah we're no longer fostering even unknown conversations and when families go out to restaurants everyone's in their phone true yes so I think my takeaway point right now would be that but Dr Manish to take further on your screen screening at a polo preventive Healthcare I understand that you're using ouri to do a lot of the screening I like to send some of my celebrity clients there I like to send the young clients over there because they would be able to get these services so what is the gamut that somebody can expect and what are we screening and how early can we capture something like if you can give me an example like oh I know my grandfather had diabetes so or or something even more life-threatening as you said the incidences of cancer are going up oh I have XY Z cancer so can this AI screening really give us um more value for this real estate that I own so um you know recently launched our AI enabled Precision oncology centers um and we launched them I mean two of them in Bangalore and the biggest USP for those oncology centers is AI enable diagnosis so one is a fast diagnosis and a more accurate diagnosis because of the huge repository of data that we've built AP poo Cancer Centers have built over the last 40 odd years it has given us the capacity um to diagnose even rare cancers faster and you know more accurately so that's one even in the realm of cardiovascular diseases our AI enabled engine has uh the the predictive um you know um algorithm to diagnose cardiovascular disease is faster and better so these are the two immediate examples that come to my mind I think you know coincidently cardiovascular disease and cancer are the two most prevalent n cities in India and if a polo preventive Healthcare program can do something to mitigate that I think it'll be a great gift to the nation awesome so um the the cardiac risk score cardiac the the AI cardiovascular disease risk score um that we've built um actually has taken the longitudinal journeys of people people who've come to Apollo over many years can I say can I say that is like my report card from first standard to 10 standard that's right that's right of all the PA all of of of a large cohort of people right but why would you want to know everybody yeah so a large cohort but why what is the purpose so basically we then know if somebody came in with certain types of indicators early what does that mean for that kind of person 5 years out 10 years out and we've taken about 21 different contributors to the heart attack and figured out through an AI algorithm what is the combination that for this person right what is the paths that they are on right you said we throw the ball we know where it will land this is exactly what the cardiac rcore algorithm does today based on your current state which includes your family history unmodifiable risk factor and all your current lifestyle as well as your current health State we then are able to predict your chance of having a heart event within 10 years within 10 years within 10 years and if a 25-year-old walked in you could still tell them that you probably are a candidate for a heart attack by 35 that's right so let me tell you the scarier statistic when we looked at 30 to 50 year olds mhm who came in and then we applied the cardiac risk score on them after it was developed one in two of them right so 50% half of them have a moderate or high risk of having a cardiac event within the next 10 years so if I'm screening one is you're putting the fear of God in Me In terms of I one out of two that could have the heart attack and so now you're telling me that information and then you're asking me to change my sleep my diet my lifestyle and my community Ryan we need the wakeup call right I think we have all realized that without that we are going to coast in life anything anything what do you mean by Coast in life do the same things that we are used to without necessarily changing the path yeah preventive healthare is saying let me use the screening and figure out what's your pathway and if there's a roadblock ahead you could take a te tour te tour right so that you're able to ensure that yeah and good on a different path and i' just like to add one point here I think it's today the market is crowded with a lot of health check packages being offered by you know everybody yeah there are so many health so many packages so if I walk into Apollo Healthcare what what's what am I looking for or what am I what are the first things I need to do so one is of course as I said we simplified earlier you know we used to have a plethora of health package we've simplified now we have AIDS specific for men and women that's it so if you're a 30-year-old male you have a whole body test which has already been customized for you you don't need to kind of look through the whole Maze of tests so we've kind of simplified it and then with this AI enablement you can be assured of a faster and more accurate diagnosis third the point I was trying to make was that today everybody in the market is offering multiple Health packages it's very important to discern and be very careful in which hospital we go to you know I think it's important to trust very credible institution because it's your life that you're screening I mean that you're entrusting them with so rather than choosing the most economical or the most convenient health screening package it's important to do that with the most credible Health partner that you know so do some research you know you know you have these xyz's selling packages at 1,000 rupees and all I think we are we we shouldn't take that very very lightly it's better to kind of peer premium but get yourself screened at the best center uh with some research I think the additional way we've Incorporated AI into Pro Health which is Apollo's health check program is uh we are able to today personalize a package if you choose to based on your risks right so some people want a Tali right and we simplified the Tali to be able to easily pick and select others say no no I have gluten allergy lactose intolerance I actually want to go alak cart but how do I pick aart I'm not an expert as a lay person and what we've therefore done is sat with our doctors with years of their clinical expertise put together an engine that can predict based on simply 10 questions that you answer what you are at risk for and therefore what you should be tested for wow I'm already thinking how how do I get to the nearest Apollo H checkup and get it done okay so let's get more people tested in this country right that's going to be our mission and vision get more people screen get more people tested we are a very large country one .3 billion plus people I'm sure there's a lot of statistical variation North India South India there's this huge dietary difference uh height difference body type difference pollution difference um are there any data coming up to you guys that says that people from South India should uh run faster for a testing people from North India should run faster with give us some insights so there was a recent report um I read uh which was conducted across several States in in India uh you know if I look at diabetes for example South and North are actually equally predisposed although Central and Northeastern parts of the country have less incidents of diabetes it's also an urban phenomena so right Urban population has more diabetes incidents than rural population but interestingly pre-diabetes is actually the the number is much higher than the diabetic population which is a very dangerous thing Dr for the uninitiated there right everyone says diabetes diabetes diabetes can you in a layman term explain what is diabetes and then what is pre-diabetes yeah so diabetes is a condition where the body's ability to produce insulin is compromised insulin is produced from uh pancreas and when there are cells in pancreas that become nonfunctional the insulin quantity reduces and our body's ability to process glucose diminishes and hence you have high blood sugar and whence that blood sugar touches a certain threshold or remains beyond the threshold consistently that's when we call you know at a diabetic condition so and then the pre-diabetic pre-diabetes a stage which is oh I'm going to get I'm going to get diabetes so the AI is saying you're going to go down that path right we have a pre-diabetes risk score because once you have diabetes there's no point in any AI predicting anything in the future have it you have it but the pre-diabetes risk core tells you based again on your family history your predisposition as well as your lifestyle choices what is your risk of getting pre-diabetes which is your glycosilated hemoglobin or hb1c between 5.8 and 6.4 so everyone if you're out here in South India let's all get tested pre-diabetic because we're eating too much of carbohydrates or rice and our sugar levels have gone up but what about North India I think South India overall has a slightly marginally high risk for ncds overall but I think diabetes and hypertension are I would say uniformly equally distributed only the central part of India and northeastern part of India where had less incidents of these two conditions among genders men have a higher predisposition for you know high cholesterol level than women uh so that was the other finding but in all of this I would say the biggest alarming finding has been the rising incidence of pre-diabetes across urban and rural areas so that you know I think today for example we have 98 million diabetics in the country we the diabetic Capital right which di 17% of all overall diabetics globally and I think we love our food and we love our sweets and also that the fact that we have this propensity exactly propensity as a population you made something very keen because my father-in-law is an orthopedic surgeon he's 78 years old and he loves he's from orisa and he loves his mishy doy and rusas and all and he eats more sugar than I do right and he has an hp1c score of 5.2 so you mentioned something from that part of India people have a diabetic resistant G gene or something I mean they have less propensity less propensity for diabetes I'm just thinking and I'm sure he's quite active isn't he yeah he's very active I'm just thinking if we could just get that Gene you know and uh like eat our rcas more often but jokes jokes apart I think as a nutritionist people are eating far more than their fathers and mothers and their grandfathers and grandmothers we just did a food diary with few of our clients I I had the privilege of working with a family of three generations so I would ask the grandfather and grandmother how many times you ate out so they met out once a quarter at MTR and ate once a quarter because they didn't have that much of money right the father and mother met out once a month you didn't have that much money true the children are in MTR every third day right so so the incidences of external exposure and therefore when you go out no portion control you eat how much you want absolutely and with the new thing which I feel is that people are just eating more because they're stressed out like we work very hard and that's what that Grandfather said we did a 9 to5 job there was no SMS WhatsApp or or Zoom call at 7:00 in the evening which your boss gone to you so you stopped your day but your generation are working double hard which means the brain is working so much so when you finish your day you're like I don't need a reward yeah yeah yeah or you're not as conscious about it also because you're so distracted with so many things that are going on I never thought about that right being distracted yeah and therefore you end up just uh consuming whatever how much ever without really being mindful about what's going on and since a lot of your followers like new nutrition allow me to actually talk about my three rules around consumption the first is reduce reduce right um let's stop eating when we are 80% full Ah that's a nice thought yeah and so reduce the second is reorder proteins and vegetables and fruits first and then carbohydrates Oh I thought you meant reorder a aater get me another order I was like this doctor is really cool okay re means change the order in which you are consuming consuming yeah that's right so say that again protein first and veget protein and fruits and vegetables vegetables first first then carbohydrates so for example in our home the proteins come out to the table first get served first salads fruits and vegetables even if in a cooked form get served first so while it's first on your table even if you're mindless about it you're that's what you're consuming first and you get a little bit full and then come the carbs onto your plate right and so reorder and the third is replace where you can find a way to replace the processed foods that we are used to these days with a little bit more traditional foods like some of your millets or uh brown rice brown sugar jagi and so forth in reduced quantities right so allows us to then replace some of the ingredients in what we cook for an overall balanced meal but it's still the kind of food that we eat every day at home without putting pressure on the kitchen yeah so I just wanted to add I mean you know and you would probably I mean you're the expert this that Dean Nash's diet what have I got the name did I get the name Dean orish diet right that actually changing your dietary habits can reverse aging and reverse many of these conditions isn't that right so as as a celebrity nutritionist I make a lot of money doing that exactly exactly the job so I meant it's just not the I mean screening is big part of it but I think diet and change in modification right I think going forward is going to be play a big role if doctor I can speak very candidly from a nutritionist to a doctor the screening gives you the Wake Up Call yes to wake up and smell the roses that you have only one body absolutely and this body cannot be replaced like your mobile phone laptop house and even spouse in fact one day I had an argument with my wife I said my body is my life partner she says what do you mean to say I'm your life partner I'm like look dude I had to get out of bed to get married to you the body went it got married to you trust me very true our body should be a first love yes and so I told her this my wife is not hearing this yeah no you like me like me I slept in the next bedroom for the next one week yeah you sleep with your life part but but at the end of the day um you know when we do these screenings I have seen an instant disciplinary modification by my client the reason being is I'll give you an example oh Dean Onish told me to eat this diet plan Ryan Fernando told me to eat this di plan but if your AI heart screening says you are predisposition to diabetes or heart attack in so many days then the person's sitting down in the counseling room and saying what do I need to change yes it's the trigger for change behavioral modification for change and I think over a period of time if genetic screening were to become cheap and mandatory in some form or shape that would actually lead to you know Revolution so to speak and also these exercise variables that we using uh gives another data set point and um I think people are shying away from the fact that they can take control of their life yeah but speaking of control uh we all work right and we all work and we have this 9 to5 we have to report in you're here today on my podcast only 9 to5 Ryan what kind of job do you do oh I have a 9 to5 job I doing do my diet my sleep and my workouts correctly but the fact of the matter is here's this okay I believe corporates can do lot more for their employees how do you think a polo preventive healthare can be embedded and do you feel doctor that it has a productivity impact on an employee so um let me start with first Apollo's own example yeah right our chair what do you mean by Apollo's own example so our chairman Pratap Redi uh is exceptionally passionate about preventive Health he in fact started the master health screening in 1974 in India I was not even born then wow that that early on he's the pioneer of pioneer of preventive Health PR health checks in the country okay and he's constantly pushing us to evolve um about 5 six years ago he said listen as corporates we actually our biggest asset are our employees and we Apollo are in the healthcare sector we need to lead the way uh for all corporates so all of the employees at apulu will get their uh Pro Health done um at the expense of the company one year goes by two year goes by a few people here in there who have triggers in their personal life went and did it um but not everybody we many many people avoided it like the general public today and then one year he said we will not be doing performance appraisals if you do not complete your hell check by March 31 and that applied to doctors as well doctors as well you're kidding me doctors were not doing the preventive Health not all of them and he made it for them as well and the was Madness right Madness because sometimes you need a parent to take care of you yes but here's the beauty of it after that that year you didn't have to repeat that statement ever again it became a habit every year now we just get people coming because we then give a reminder and then they said ah and then the I guess the trauma of that year um they come and they do it I think more and more and more corporates need to um uh take this on right and do this for their employees but now that we have at a large cohort level multiple years of having done this Ryan what we're seeing in terms of the reduction in the unmanaged diabetes unmanaged cholesterol levels and most important the decline in obesity right it's it's staggering so we now have the data to be able to see at an aggregate level of a is hypertension also part of this because I'm assuming there's a lot of stress and it's also coming down there a lot of stress that's also coming down because see once you're diagnosed with it you manage it but if you know you have a propensity and you learn to manage it and ultimately it comes down to what you consume how much you move how you sleep and how you manage your stress right and so we'll talk a little bit about Pro Health and how we are incorporating some of the follow-ups and nudges to be able to do that but staying with your your founder Dr ready and uh doing this in 1974 I get called in to do a lot of events and speak about it when the leader leads the organization from the value of the employee and the value is not only from a perspective of productivity but the essence of a person then Healthcare becomes crucially and truly important yes where am I going with the statement I had a billionaire client who instructed his HR to set up Healthcare preventive in the organization but many times and this goes out to the rest of India many times HR is truly focused on the bottom line truly focused on only holidays and truly only focused on attendance marking and how we can get more out of people and if Apollo as an organization in itself led by a doctor who's a leader insists that everyone gets their health checkup done and puts a dictat to it and I think the word over there is dictat because I remember once sitting as a nutritionist I asked myself when I run my own organization today as this as the head of my organization as a Founder do I invade my employees privacy or am I actually being the crystal ball astrologer and saying I want to take care of you so I send a message back to your founder kudos to what he's done for all the people at Polo and I think every organization out there needs to have a leader that puts a boot silently up everyone saying that you need to get your Health Care Checkup done so speaking of offices can we do these Pro Health checkups in offices absolutely I think um in in our conversations with uh corporates and companies what we realize is uh even if they have a set of offerings right and pral checks for their employees very few actually take it up anywhere from 10 to 30% of employees actually uh go to a center and uh Avail a pro health and therefore we realize we have to rethink the model because uh employees don't want to uh do this um at a at a take the time to to go out it's actually quite inconvenient especially in cities where some of the centers are very far away from their homes so we've actually innovated on a couple of different models um one is we have what is called an Apollo health check on Wheels this is a mobile bus that is fitted with equipment such as a digital x-ray or a mamogram and has additional equipment that can be wheeled off so a cardiac stress bike to make sure that we can test your heart under some endurance um eye screening audiometry and so forth along with of course your routine blood test but we wanted to make sure that what we offer to employees is actually quite comprehensive and not just simply blood tests and so we have the fitted um ahc on wheels or Apollo H checks on wheels that can then go park itself in an office complex and then be able to um conduct the screenings at the convenience of the employees um over a period of a few days another uh Innovation that we've actually worked out operationally is your hchi can be broken up into a couple of different parts the first part is we draw your blood let's say a flomist or a nurse can come out to the office at your desk or in a common room you come in and they draw your blood label your samples and ship it off to the lab they are then able to process the reports and keep it ready you then can book an appointment for the Imaging component your ultrasound your mamogram your uh x-ray um ECG Echo and so forth to make sure it's a comprehensive has check in the hospital or the clinic at a time that's convenient to you and because the blood is already drawn the reports are ready the doctor review can happen right away and this can also be done at any time of the day it could be during your lunch break it could be in the evening it could be on a Sunday and you also spend less time because you're not waiting for the lab reports to get to come in so this is another way that we've actually uh innovated to be able to make this more convenient for employees and you know the last year Al we probably have screened about 8 to 9,000 um corporate Health uh corporate employees uh in their campuses through this um and we besides this we also give them corporate Health report cards report cards health I that's important right when when I get a report card then I I know that I have to do some steps it's not like washed under the rug that I just got a absolutely so there's a report card at the individual level um that tells you what's going on what needs immediate attention and then what are some of the next steps for you to actually do and then there is a company report card as well right because if you think about the company as a community and productivity and the health of the employees is an important asset for you then at an aggregate level how are you doing right if your um employees have much higher numbers have hyperen than the average in in the population then there's something for you to actually think about yeah that's very interesting because there's a joke over here when we were sitting at one of the Fortune 500 companies as a nutrition clinic so we did a small survey and we asked the employees to tick mark and one of the questions was about constipation so about 100 employees went through the survey and about 67 of them or 68 of them ticked Mark constipation and so when the head HR saw that she went no wonder everyone walks through the front door with a with a grumpy face early morning that's exactly right so what you're saying to me is the health of an organization is truly reflected in the health of its people and that's when I realized this so getting a report card not only for the individual but the organization yes I think every CFO should be listening and carefully about this and then the head of HR who saw this and then choose to do something more meaningful around constipation related activities right whether it's changing what they serve in the kitchen to have more fiber or talking much more about different aspects of fiber changing the snacks in the kitchen for more fiber and allows them to focus some of the well-being programs around things that actually matter rather than just the generic well-being program so we talked about the adults and the office space and I'm sure there are a lot of mothers out there who are also working and the first question that any mother asks is about her children yes so are there any actionable sets of things that people can do what can a doctor give an advice for children out there for this I don't know if I can call it a pandemic of oncoming diabetes hypertension and non-communicable diseases so what should parents do with their children or what what should we do so at Apollo what we found Ryan is that um three out of five children today especially in urban and privileged schools are obese three out of five overweight or obese wow yeah and that essentially is setting the stage for a very young adulthood that could have many of these ncds much much earlier much earlier so we going to be the youngest 1.3 billion population but also have the highest amount of uh these lifestyle diseases unless we do something about it now and screening is one of them and changing the behavior of the younger kids sorry so what what is the next part of this three out of five we actually did uh with Pro Health at Apollo is to actually think about from a pediatric perspective right what do you need to know about a child at five or 6 years old when they're ready to go to school is their eyesight okay do they have any sort of attention related conditions right that you need to be watching out for uh adolescence hormones kick in very different kinds of behaviors what are we doing to actually make sure we're screening for some of those issues right girl hits puberty do we have enough iron in the diet right what are some of the hormones doing to their body what are some of the um high-risk behaviors that teenagers are getting into so we've actually thought about different stages of childhood if you will um and then said what should we be screening for based on what the pediatrician is picking up so the first thing is make sure you do go see the pediatrician early ages will be all about vaccinations but then around 5 six then let's add uh a little bit around what uh they need to be ready for school um subsequent years after 5 till 10 you actually lose touch with the pediatrician true yeah and 10 you come back for couple of vaccinations and you're on the cusp of puberty so the pediatrician has another opportunity and then what after that tell me when you go to a doctor next only when you have a symptom or you're sick right but I think having uh some touch and engagement with your pediatrician at least until you're 16 allows them a window into figuring out if there's anything going on and it could be something as simple as um when suddenly uh boys grow taller at a particular age their body's phys iology right uh is not keeping up yet with the shooting up in the height and therefore they may have some dizziness and so it's little things like that that parents don't have to stress about but if they know in advance and the best person to get someone that advice from is actually an expert doctor a pediatrician in this case so as parents if you can't get through to your children directly find a way to engage with through your pediatrician on a regular basis and you know to just drive home that point we have a whole vertical dedicated for uh kids called Apollo childrens I mean it's whole vertical and not just looking after acute care or chronic care but also Wellness um as part of this verticle just to kind of focus more on this this age group uh which needs attention in multiple forms I think most of us as parents we kind of like hear a Hospital's name and think uh oh if I take my kid over there the kid is sick uh it's a place of pain but actually we need to rethink preventive health care yeah even for our children because I am at the nutrition clinic doing a lot of sports kids and in these sports kids we ask for a blood test because I am going to give them a protein powder a sports drink a multivitamin and I'm like look I don't want to give you a product I know you play four hours of tennis a day 6 hours of tennis a day or 6 hours of golf a day but I know that I can't give you the stuff unless I know there is a nutritional deficency let's do a blood test and lo and behold when we do a blood test on a n 10 12 15y old 16y old we have high cholesterol we have uric acid right and that's scary yeah I think some somewhere parents also have to share some part of that blame because you made that point early on also we are consuming more than we need and that's true for kids I mean obesity is on a rise and I'm not surprised with these cholesterol levels and sugar levels on the rise as well you know screen time look at screen time look at the kind of processed food they're consuming I think it's extremely unusual and I'll not be surprised and that kind of ties into a point about pre-diabetics On The Rise so it's all a chain and somewhere I think parents also have to share that responsibility and be be strict with their kids see in the modern day conveniences that liberalization of the country brought is huge right I mean we are all living it and enjoying it but along with that came the bane of some of these lifestyle diseases we have the advantage of seeing what it's done to the West let's learn from it and not make the same mistakes and wait as long yeah that those are wise words you know we touched about children and the office space and somewhere in our conversation Dr Mishu said that one of the biggest post-pandemic Targets on people's back was cancer The Big C right now are there any specific specific types of cancer that you are seeing at Apollo Healthcare on the rise uh and what age group are you seeing it and somebody watching in if they're in that age profile what are you telling a person in their 30s to 40s 40s to 50s 50s to 60 60 to 70 are they watching out for anything from a cancer screening point of view so cancer screening I think as the incident has picked up so has screening so for the L man and me also what do you mean by cancer screening I'm going to go in and going to a needle in me or what are the basic things that you do when you SC so you know for females for example um get a breast screening done whether it's an ultrasound or a mamogram and there are guidelines for it you know and then um get a papsmear done you know anually and then a colonoscopy every 10 years say after 50 years also yes yes yes because okay I thought only men get uh uh colon cancer I the incidence is higher but you know colon cancer is on the rise in the country across genders so these are and for men of course oral examination prostate uh and colonoscopy as I said uh because among men lung cancer prostate cancer cancer of the stomach esophagus head and neck cancers are on the rise highest incidents and on in females cervical breast and lung cancers in that order and these cancer screenings that you're doing you're also having the genetic screening done because I'm asking this question from a perspective can I blame my grandfather and grandparents or is this environment that is causing my cancer now so Ryan there's an expiry date for blaming your parents right there's an expiry date for blaming your parents I'm assuming I'm assuming it the day you say byebye mama papa and you leave the house I I think it's somewhere in your early 20s where you start to truly take charge um and own your life yeah I think um the uh challenge I have is that blood tests almost never catch the cancers until much much much too late in some cases not at all unless it is blood cancer um imaging radiology scans chest x-ray loo C whole body MRIs um mammograms ultrasounds colonoscopies this is what catches the cancers early right and therefore making sure that based on your age and family history that is anyone close to you who you may know has had a cancer please then regularly screen yourselves and regularly means at least once a year once a year yes for some right like he said colonoscopy you need once in 10 years papsmear you need once in 3 years as long as you're clear so there are guidelines and this is what also feeds into our personalization engine as well so if I have a family history of breast cancer on the maternal side my chance of breast cancer is very high and therefore I better start scanning at 35 every year but if I don't have that I still am uh a woman greater than 40 have a chance of getting breast cancer um please screen at least every other year for sure after 40 in our data at Apo we found that 25% of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer were less than 40 wow that's a that's a heartbreaking statistic yes why so the so it's all the more reason if you're younger than 40 years a female to get tested just to rule out that you're not one of those 25% and early detection I think is one of the best things a person can do in cancer right yeah and you know that's one and I'll tell you the reason also because it's been found uh you know a study was done in UK uh by National Cancer registration and Analysis service that the more severe form of cancer um you know it it is the less the presentation the typical symptoms are lesser and difficult to diagnose for example you know brain tumor for example will present with head head headache and nuse and all which we can mistake for any other you know minor ailment indigestion can can be a symptom of stomach cancer but we don't take it seriously pancreatic cancer the symptoms are very atypical non-typical and perhaps can be ignored but that's the warning sign unless you get yourself screened every year there's no way of knowing and by the time they present in far more severe form it's already too late wow you know speaking of too late moving from the big sea to yes we're screening people people are getting more healthier there's the other end of spectrum where people are getting too healthy the gym goers the gym Buffs body transformation six six packs I can run 32 km after starting yesterday morning right so we have a lot of these flag bearers because in school they played for the ranji team or they were on the volleyball team or they won the swim team and like yeah I'm so fit and I've watched all this podcasts and fit India programs and all of these influencers and all and then suddenly you see a lot of people dropping dead yeah from heart attacks in gyms you know in marathon runners um so are we confusing ourself with Fit Body and healthy body doctor what's your take on this because when you're doing screening you're like the referee over there you're refering and you can see everyone on the playing field and you see this fit buff person who hasn't done screening and then you see this average Charlie who's done the screening so Fit Body or healthy body what's your take on this yeah so especially Jim goers marathon runners the organ for us to focus on here is the heart yeah and the most common um condition of the heart that we've all heard about is the heart attack that is caused by a clot and and that is a result of many years of plaque deposit inside Our arteries that hardens breaks off and a clot will go and block a blood vessel and then that area will not be able to get oxygen from the blood and hence it ends up being a problem when that blood vessel is actually in the Heart Right it causes a heart attack that's the most common thing that we've all heard of and that comes from years of unfit lifestyle and diet and lack of uh activity and so forth however the heart is actually a amazing organ it requires electrical impulses at a regular frequency for it to beat it also requires muscles to be able to pump the blood enough so that it reaches the Tippy Toe and and the corner of your brain when you put the heart under stress while your arteries may be clean because you're eating very well and you're extremely active it may actually come in the way of the electrical activity and the pumping activity and that's what sudden cardiac death or people suddenly dropping debt actually comes from so doctor I'm just thinking about everybody who watches my podcast at some point they want to work out oh you're talking about head screening oh you're talking about exercise oh you're talking about diet I'm going to start exercising and everyone goes into fourth gear suddenly is there any test that they can do at Apollo Healthcare preventive healthare that will give them some sort of indication K by go slow or go all out is is is there anything that we can discover there is AP poloo uh Pro Health heart screening package if you ask me for somebody who's interested in doing this that's actually a short short test to know whether you are fit enough to take take up these R vigorous physical exercises you will get patients that you will have to tell them go easy glow absolutely absolutely I mean and they look young oh yeah many of them I mean we've had patients in the early 20s coming in with with an esia with you know with with a heart ariia means what irregular heartbeat irular heartbe is this inherited or this is a lifestyle because I'm asking this question if I if I had arhythmia oh where did I get it do I look at my parents or do I look at my diet I think it could be both Aria could be a result of a lesion that you have in your heart because of a previous heart attack so it could be linked to your history or your lifestyle and these conditions are maintainable reversible uh or every condition I would say manageable is the one I think reversible is uh used too Loosely today yeah everyone wants damage is done yeah it depends on how much damage now yes right so uh if if a home is damaged slight damage we can fix and correct and it will look as good as new and even feel and maybe it's or if you maintain your house very well then it do doesn't get damaged that often but if the foundation is off and the damage has been there for 20 years and you didn't even know because you didn't get screened and it's shown up as a symptom then I don't think a reversible is possible what you can do is manage manage and I also want to come in that point of marathonas you know having these sudden cardiac arest and all I think it's important to get the underlying heart condition checked which has been aggravated by you know a symptom called I mean A syndrome called long covid the long-term effects of covid which we are seeing across um genders across age groups and all so I think the propensity of people to have these issues postco has increased um chest high cholesterol level diabetes incidents hypertension and so on and so forth so we have to be very very mindful coupled with the fact that many of these um you know victims have had vigorous F physical exercise and an undetected underlying condition that's led to these incidents that we have seen in the past and I think the other uh realization is also that our body is very interconnected it's not like one organ is independent another right and so when um when you have such vigorous activity the lung and the heart have to be in such s with one another so a V2 Max test with along with a treadmill allows us to see under the conditions of such endurance and stress how does your heart and lung perform together and therefore are you ready otherwise an ECG Echo and TMT treadmill test this combination can actually tell you what your current heart condition is and ECG will detect the heartbeat in the electrical activity the echo is about the pumping and the treadmill test is about placing the heart under a little bit of stress increasingly and seeing how you respond and how the um ECG the pumping as well as the electrical activity response in that context so let's not mistake a Fit Body for a healthy body that's the mistake people are making very commonly these days yeah and I think because of lack of time everyone's trying to get this uh instant body instant result instant health and so even when they're doing their Fitness they're doing this instant Fitness and that instant Fitness is actually a very high level of Expert Fitness yeah and I think also we have to caution the workout industry right yeah absolutely the trainer is given a certain pressure to deliver a certain result very quickly and I think the the sports trainer the athletic trainers the physio trainers have to work with the industry and their client and say like slow and steady wins the race you know and uh do you do anything like a body fat percentage test yes so we actually do the body fat composition analyzer right which actually gives you a sense for uh not just BMI right that's okay an easy metric that many people know the body mass index but I think um how much visceral fat do you have and that means how much of your fat around the abdominal organs right around your organs do you have that's actually far worse than what I'm going to call the total fat or in your periphery right so it's okay to carry a little bit of fat in your thighs and your hips and your buttocks right but not so much in your abdominal region um it also gives you a sense for your basil metabolic rate which means when you're at a resting state typically sleeping what is the metabolic rate of your body at that time the challenge with sitting without moving for 30 to 45 minutes is that our body thinks we are in a little bit of a resting state and the basil metabolic rate drops to as if you were sleeping that means when you reach out and have that sugar cookie and drink that chai with oh it's going to the liver it's going to the liver exactly and it's not metabolizing it even as well as it should and so the body composition analyzer allows us much more insight into what to do next you know why I asked this question because everyone joins the gym or goes Marathon running to lose the fat that they gained over 20 years from college into their first job second job Shadi having two kids and then they need to lose it fast but they don't know that to burn one kg of fat requires slow walking of 2 hours every day for one month because you have to be in that fat burn zone right not running that puts you in a cardiac Zone which is great for your cardio but not doesn't burn your fat as easily you've heard it there first from the doctor fat burning and I have been always been saying this I told even Amir Khan in his dungle movie role he has to walk 38,000 steps to lose fat you have to walk to lose fat you don't need a Fit Body running like usin bolt or kennet bner you need to walk and have patience to get to that goal and always do a health screening now when you're speaking of screening we got the Fit Body 80% of gyming audience in India is male what about the female I know we talked a little bit about breast cancer screening and all but quickly what are the bang bang bang bang scans that a woman has to do because most women I meet they're always in the hurry managing the home managing the family managing everything right so they like they don't have time to do lots of stuff so quickly what should a woman do for all her screenings um definitely a dexas can dexas scan what's that bone density as well as muscle bone density and muscle um heart after menopause heart after menopause because your hormones actually protect you estrogen and so forth before menopause um the mammograms we talked about paps cervical cancer as early as possible and if you're really young then please get the vaccination HPV vacc far more protective and my generation didn't have it I think the only other one I will actually highlight here is uh cognitive screening cognitive screening and that means figuring out your brain function and the reason I say this is uh we're seeing also that perhaps because of the many many priorities we juggle and hold on to the stress there is a Slowdown of the brain function much later in life manifesting as memory losses dementias and so forth and so please find a way to do some cognitive screening husbands if you heard this in this is what you need to do don't get angry at your wife take her to a poo Healthcare and get her screening done because Dr Satya said so not you so there's one part that I want to ask because I get a lot of young athletes and I don't know if this is relevant to preventive healthc care screening but all the female athletes I work with from the age of 12 their first menstruation cycle till maybe even their marriage they have never met a gynecologist doctor how important is it for a young female girl a young lady yes to go and meet a gynecologist even if nothing is wrong um so it's a great question Ryan I think firstly definitely meet the pediatrician pediatrician yes because the pediatrician is trained up around multiple facets including the puberty right and sort of what I'm going to call Early fertility period um so that means when the girl first gets her menstration cycle the pediatrician is a great person to have a touch waste with absolutely because it the pediatrician all then can decide if there is anything that we should be watching for allows the pediatrician to educate the parent and the girl child to be aware we have a lot of teenage weight gain nowadays in the female athlet yes so uh is that towards the pcod condition so uh the polycystic ovar um syndrome is actually on the rise and impacting fertility are we testing this in a preventive Health Care setup so the way we would test for this is um through hormones and the hormone panel and we absolutely do it thyroid typically comes up as the number one so we have thyroid stimulating hormone test um included in our women panels um we also make sure that if someone is overweight or a bees then we throw in a hormonal panel um and then there is questions around your menstrual cycle I think it's very important for women to find a way to make note and understand any pack Downs or trends that they're seeing there are apps on the phone we are married to our phones um and enough of this is available and If not go oldfashioned calendar in you know either the digital format or noted down so if a woman's cycle is 28 to 30 days she's good but if it's skipping or missing yes then maybe pick up the phone and talk to a guy and then in between spotting that's another one okay so in between spotting ladies please watch for that and we're talking about the youngsters yes many of them will go and meet a gynecologist after marriage for birth control or for fertility but I am seeing girls in much younger ages not doing this so you could get yourself screened with a good gynecologist Now we move into the part where not only girls and boys but everyone at all age has this stress problem now I don't know whether preventive healthc care screening um throw light on this but obviously you have all of this data and screening all of these people we know we need to get screened yes that's that's a given right now some tips from Dr Satya in terms of stress and sleep oh how important are these two are they married to each other and are there any insights you would like to share with our audience so um stress and sleep are uh collaborate with one another and also then cause a number of physical changes that lead to the downstream non-communicable diseases we've been talking about um I am going to go straight to the hacks and the tips um Ryan I think uh when it comes to stress I think uh it's a very very important to find a way to declutter your brain every day we get about 23 to 25 GB worth of information that our brain has to process wow right so think about your computers and when it crashes and the hard disk essentially stress levels are related to how much processing you're doing and not allowing your brain to figure out what's important to keep what to discard and what to not worry about so decluttering is important and that comes in a number of different ways it could be taking a very very short mini break to a place that is away from a city so that you just have less visual stimulation it could be locking yourself up and just reading a book with nobody around you because then you're focused only on one thing the words on the page it could be uh doing yoga and uh staying through the shavasana because it's really important part of decluttering your brain and it could be ensuring that you actually get enough and good quality sleep I think sleep in at least our research findings for people who come um to Apollo we find is correlated with diabetes and hypertension and the risk of that goes up so we've Incorporated sleep screening and stress screening as part of TR Health as well and there are so many different ways we all hear it from so many influencers don't look at the blue light turn off your TV 1 hour before sleeping but guess what that's also the time we want to binge watch and use our Netflix and Amazon Prime accounts right um so we may need to figure out okay after that binge watching can I do a 15minute meditation app that allows me to go uh calm down and sleep um is it a Epsom salt soak while I'm binge watching Netflix so that I'm able to actually smiling because I do a lot of the deps in all soak and it really works it worked for me by the way it worked for me I had such a big sleep problem because of all the stress and I had to figure out solutions that would work for me only then can I share it with other people and epsom salt soap was one of those and so these are the quick hacks and tips that I would share with people to please proactively manage uh sleep and stress it has crept into our lives um and is less talked about than diet and life and physical activity um so please be mindful of it and see how we can actually proactively manage it and and lack of good sleep has been found to be a big contributing factor factor to these sudden cardiac deaths that we just spoke about yeah you know Dr Manesh I remember reading this line from the Netflix CEO he said we are on a war with sleep so if you think about it you can binge watch into your Saturday night and Sunday night and turn up like a zombie at work and then have to download that 25 GB and work for the next 5 days that brain processor is overheating and that's your stress at the end of the day it's not changing anytime soon our lifestyle is not going to change anytime soon I think the wisdom has to come from the ancient behaviors that we had or the text that we had but the modern day screening that kind of gives you a little bit of cold water thrown on your face saying wake up buddy yes you know the you have these issues speaking of cold water being thrown on all of our face as a sports nutritionist I constantly have to motivate my athletes and I've been practicing for two decades now and I'm noticing a lot more of the younger generation maybe in the last 10 years I don't know whether it's the environment the food or the pressure of the fast space of life but mental health problems have cropped up how do we first find that I have a mental problem how do I know is there any secret out there that says oh I'm facing this and I'm beginning to break down because I think a lot of my athletes are waiting too late before they come in so from a health care perspective how can we manage it or how can I I think before we manage it one is to detect it and then is to manage it so any words of wisdom or insights that you guys have in our Hospital experience um we've seen that the stigma that used to be associated with mental health issues has come down significantly after covid C actually was the inflection point where people started talking about it a lot so in fact our you know op consults for psychologists and psychiatrists have almost you know multiplied three three times uh since covid so that's the kind of influx we're seeing because people are accepting mental health issues as so there's a normalization of mental health issues um so I think they were Al always there I mean these issues but I think people are recognizing them early on anding for help asking for help so I think the first step is to recognize and seek help which I think is you know changed a lot in the last last three years so that's I think one step and then of course there are several therapies available now U you know psychotherapies there are there is medication management which is available um so and mental health from that standpoint is fairly controllable now many of these conditions because I think there are a lot of new drugs available in the market uh you know I've seen friends and family seek help and get treated you know very fast which wasn't the case perhaps 10 years 10 20 years back so I think that's a big advancement that has happened so I I guess seek early help facilities are available now Co has changed that and many drugs that are available today I mean not to speak of other therapies like yoga and meditation um but I think there's room for many such therapies out there in the market today I think in addition um the point we discussed earlier about a community around you um it may be hard for you to recognize it and come to terms with it but if you have a community around you that you have been mindful with then um um they will recognize it for you right and I think it therefore is every one of our responsibilities to watch for the people around us uh whether it is at work whether it is in our social communities or in our families um and to pick up these little signs um it could be someone who is not paying attention uh the way they used to someone who's very distracted someone who Slips Away into social isolation doesn't join a number of the activities that we do and then be able to have a conversation or get somebody who is trained to have a conversation and help that individual recognize it um we I think have heard that sitting is the new smoking um what we've realized in a post pandemic world is that loneliness and social isolation is the new sitting and the new smoking I've heard that it's as bad as smoking 15 20 cigarettes a day in terms of the kind of damage that it does without you even realizing it wow that's profound loneliness and social isolation social isolation yeah and we come to think of it know we always in our phones and we tend to find that as an easier companion than the community around us and you know what's more worrying is the impact mental health issues are having on our kids today and adolescents that I think is a tiing time bomb because as adults we still have some um you know agency to deal with these issues because of her experience but kids have nowhere to go adolesence have know where to go they take a long time figuring out what's wrong with them so taking time bomb I mean there's a lot that we have to do uh to help Society at large now as a country uh the whole country there are a lot of these casualties happening from non-communicable diseases what can we do to reduce that um I think uh definitely screening and we've designed Pro Health to be able to take care of it at a personalized level and to be able to help you figure out what the next steps are um once you've done that I also am going to appeal to to um companies and organizations that uh do and have the luxury of funding CSR so our screenings need to go beyond those who can afford it so one second you mean to say if a company has more profit they we give that to a corporate social responsibility they could actually take that money and test people and screen people yes those who can't necessarily afford it they could take care of the uh Urban poor uh rural areas semi-urban areas they could look at uh areas around their factories around their ports um and adopt those communities and Screen them so that we're able to actually reach much much more of India um and ensure that uh you know we have this silent epidemic that is going unnoticed under control in the country doctors your vision and the mission that you're on AT AP poo preventive Healthcare if you had to sum it up and tell us what is it that India needs from Apollo preventive Healthcare I think we need to be NCD free by 2040 as a country that's a tough ask and uh we've always risen to a challenge as a country and uh we have gotten Independence for the country and I think this is an alternate form of Independence for ourselves right um to ensure that we are living healthy for ourselves our families and for the country awesome it's been a pleasure talking to both of you today um if there's one thing that you did for your own personal health as a secret both of you could you share that with our viewers I started um you know I had a 10,000 Step Challenge which I started four months back you know I I mean I used to play sports but now I've you know like you said um 2 hours every day uh for a month to lose 1 kg I think I started on that drive four months back and it's really helping me a lot so 10,000 steps is your secret secret goal to I need to do this I mean a lot of other things it difficult to do that no actually it's very inv invigorating and I mean I I actually thought thought that you know playing sports was the be all and end all but I realized walking is a big contributor to good health and also changed dietary habits less of red meat more of salads and all which I thought I would never need but I think that's come as a wakeup call some months back because of some tests I ran and um so it was the testings that were part of the trigger yes screening was part of the trigger and which you know kind of you know nudged me towards adopting these healthy um Lifestyle Changes what with you Dr I've shared so many over there podcast let me um share one more um I think sugar sugar in our diet as a family um is something that we did uh my children grew up with uh no sugar in their milk uh no additives whatsoever but we as adults uh were pampered and had a lot of sugar in our lives um and the reason I say we went uh and did this as a family is because it helps the kitchen when you do things together and it helps each other um go through that withdrawal that I had when we stopped sugar it took us about um 10 to 14 days was that Rebellion from your kids no the kids were okay because they never uh had sugar um I ensured they weren't given a choice they weren't give it a choice and so now they when you add too much sugar they can't even handle it right but I think sugar in beverages that alone if we take care of then I'm not saying we don't enjoy the occasional myour park right or ragula we should that's part of life and that's part of actually having a good time it doesn't become main stay as a regular dozing that's right because we as Indians actually are consuming on average five times more sugar than the wh guidelines once again we're consuming so we're getting to become a developed nation and in that trajectory we consuming five times more sugar that's right and the sugar comes in the form of you know in your beverage briges much much more than you need um in biscuits and cookies that we snack on ketchup bread I mean I could go on right yeah so you're absolutely right because I remember creating a video on the national survey of consumption talking about India in the 1990s and India now and 2023 the the recent consumption Serv and so 100 rupes spent earlier it was 54 rupes towards food obviously we didn't have that much money but now it's come down to 40 rupes correct but out of 40 rupees 10 rupes 50 pisas towards processed foods and Beverages and only 3 rupees 80 Pisa towards fruit and 3 rupees 80 Pisa towards vegetable my goodness goodness that tells you right there what we're doing to ourselves absolutely so I think for everyone who is watching in you are educated you have the knowledge you have the ability to choose what you put into your body you have the ability to purchase what you put into your body you have the ability to purchase a screening program you have the ability to understand the screening test and finally you have the ability to take the decision either to have epsin salts in your bath or walk 10,000 steps or in my case having too much of nonv where my uric acid went through the roof and my I was wondering why my fingers hurting let's go and get a screening done there was a yogi Guru who said this this no I was going on a flight and the air the the airline baggage handler says sir you are overweight and he said who me or my bags so I think everyone has to go who has everyone has to go in that direction that you know only your bags are overweight but but not yourself not yourself absolutely less is more less is more absolutely so this has been a wonderful time with both you doctors I wish you all the success on your mission I hope you change millions and millions of lives and uh let's show India what is in store for a healthy
